        Another hot summer had arrived.<br />
        I was gazing listlessly at the city from the roof of a four-story
        building.
      </p>
      <p>
        This summer had started unusually late and it’s been going around that
        this year’s would be an unusually cold one, but when you pull back the
        curtain like this, it’s a heat wave toppling the daily highs.<br />
        The blazing sunlight cut at the eyes like a flashbang, and the heat
        seething up from the pavement was like some sinus-clearing musk.<br />
        A summer like a modern day Sahara Desert. Swarms of firm buildings,
        tireless caravans, and white bones of oxen dotted the hot sand.<br />
        Of course, the swarm of buildings were not so fragile as to say they
        were built on sand, and most of them had stubbornly persisted for a
        decade. Some had rotted away; even if their spirits were partly
        exhausted, one could do nothing but pray that their existence was
        fulfilling. The end comes for all things. No matter what angle you may
        take, that fundamental tragedy cannot be overthrown. If, in that tragedy
        something new was born, it would be a sufficient panacea to all of us
        who came after, though this was a meager encouragement.<br />
        And so on.<br />
        I tried indulging myself by pondering things unsuited to me, a cigarette
        in my mouth. Just idle thoughts spoiling a peaceful lunch break. It was
        pretty inelegant, but I guess lyrical contemplations are a part of my
        job too.<br />
        The roof of the building I was standing on was neither all that low nor
        all that high. It overlooked average buildings, but did not even reach
        the knees of buildings that had been constructed over the last few
        years.<br />
        Well, it was hardly an upfront building to begin with. To the common eye
        it was an abandoned building, a bad debt. It seemed that all work on the
        building was abandoned halfway through.<br />
        Ground was broken in 1992, and it was abandoned the following year in
        ’93. The lengthy construction ceased at the fifth floor, which now
        functioned splendidly as a roof. I heard that the people who used this
        abandoned building previously had worked on fixing it up. I have no idea
        what their names were or what they all looked like, but I’m thankful for
        their excessive idle curiosity.<br />
        “…”<br />
        I unintentionally raised my glance, and recalled the dizziness found in
        the white of the sun’s rays.<br />
        Only half of my field of vision remained. When I was young, I lost the
        ability to see in my right eye in an accident, but thankfully, I didn’t
        have any problems living with just my left.<br />
        I took a deep breath and recovered from my lightheadedness.<br />
        Leaning against a rotten fence, I took in the panorama of the city
        scenery to get rid of the bad taste in my mouth.<br />
        This place was about fifteen meters up. It wasn’t so picturesque that
        you could call it a bird’s eye view, but it was high enough for gazing
        at the city.<br />
        There was a face to the city up here that you couldn’t discover and
        could hardly even imagine from the ground.<br />
        Like the normal house in the corner about twenty feet away. It was old,
        a surviving two-story residence from around the Shōwa era. It was in
        fact three stories, and in a lower area where you would see nothing but
        the roof, there was a hanging garden, about six feet across and twelve
        feet long. The existence of such an overflowing green garden on top of
        the tile roof was enviable. On clear days, the laundry would be hung out
        to dry, without fail. Probably an ongoing daily routine since before I
        was born.<br />
        From this height, you could only catch sight of a small portion of the
        roof of the ten-story building standing right beside those
        Japanese-style homes. It was supposedly an office building, but the roof
        seemed to have been closed off. A winding emergency staircase was the
        sole method of access, but unfortunately, an iron railing ran down
        it.<br />
        While every person employed in the building would be brought closer to
        the picturesque scenery if they simply stepped up, they were unconcerned
        with even the existence of an entrance.<br />
        If you changed your focus yet again, you would discover a completely
        closed-off back alley. It ran between the gaps in the houses and was
        used only by people living in the neighborhood, a small path outside of
        common knowledge.<br />
        From the path, and before you went out in the street, you can reach a
        parking lot that had been constructed roughly five years ago. Once it
        had functioned as an alleyway, but now has been rendered pointless… Or
        it might have been, but a close look revealed a space that one person
        had barely been able to squeeze into. Even those of us who used that
        street everyday would probably not even notice this path in the depths
        of the parking lot.<br />
        All of those make up the face of the city, unquestionable proof that
        life existed beyond oneself.<br />
        As for my own life, the connection and breadth between them were only
        slightly fathomable from this height.<br />
        Even in the din of the city, the lives of its inhabitants don’t
        change.<br />
        It’s a present where public morals are on the rise and private morals
        decline, but everyone living their own lives is the one point that stays
        the same.<br />
        It was a motley assortment of a city that suffused with good cheer.<br />
        It wasn’t that it totally lacked malice, but that it was filled with
        goodness.<br />
        Vaguely watching that sort of idyllic day was my only hobby.<br />
        I no longer looked to the future or lost hope in it.<br />
        The past and the future are, from the view of the present, nothing more
        than a distant paradise. As one who can never achieve divinity, all I
        could do is ponder that with all of my might.<br />
        “Anyway.”<br />
        It’s hot. I had come up onto the roof with the intention to relax, but
        my break was over.<br />
        I went down the stairs and headed towards the office on the fourth
        floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the summer sun, the hallway was lit up like a hospital; the
        girl’s voice echoed.
      </p>
      <p>
        “And he ended up running away from Professor Origa. He then arrived at a
        night festival. He encountered the spring city, with its fireworks,
        paper lanterns, and cherry blossoms scattering about.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The voice was coming from the office. It was a familiar recital. The
        girl was deeply immersed in an independently published book that had
        been tucked away in the shelves.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It wasn’t as if he longed to be human.<br />
        Only, the city was so varied, so dazzling. Surely no one would notice
        one more, even someone that was not one of their own.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Curiously, it is touted for being an unpopular, lifeless short story.<br />
        The books he had left behind were mostly children’s stories, and as they
        were picture books it was only natural. But half had contents that left
        children far behind.<br />
        This short story was one such example. The setting was a city in an Edo
        blended with fantasy; the story of the life of a man who escaped from a
        professor of Western studies and lived among people.<br />
        The odd thing was, that man was not a human, but a robot. It was obvious
        that it was a robot. For a face, the robot had a perforated vacuum tube
        that represented eyes and a mouth. It was a character created to be
        barely a simulacrum of humanity, but this simplicity was exactly why it
        lingered in the memory.<br />
        The robot pretends to be a human and assimilates into the life of the
        city.<br />
        This did not arise from a desire to be human.<br />
        The robot, who had only known the dark laboratory, yearned for the
        beauty of the city. The sequence of events was reversed. The robot
        simply wanted to be human so it could be in the city, and so it
        pretended to be human.<br />
        However, several years passed, and –
      </p>
      <p>“It is a strange analogy, but I am like ink for recording.”</p>
      <p>
        A worry that the robot could tell no one had been born inside him.<br />
        He had acquired a human-like heart, but no matter what, a human body was
        the one thing he could not obtain.<br />
        Even if he could disguise his face and his arms and legs, tears and
        blood were features with which he had not been equipped.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The spring storm comes, once again.<br />
        As though were competing with the dancing and scattering cherry
        blossoms, they formed large flowers in the night sky.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Even odder was that the festival in the story took place in the spring.
        Japanese people have an intrinsic link between fireworks and the summer,
        so fireworks in the spring specifically seemed to have felt appropriate
        for the author.<br />
        It was the same night as when the robot had come to the city.<br />
        The robot, looking up at the fireworks on top of a bridge crowded with
        people, was carelessly pushed by the crowd into the river. Suddenly he
        was in the water. The robot was weak to water, and just touching it was
        damaging. All of its functions went down, and its disguise that had
        hidden it among people melted.<br />
        Even while the robot in the river short-circuited, he desperately hid
        his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s finally the awaited Spring.<br />
        They’ll drive me away. What should I do?<br />
        They’ll be frightened of me. What should I do?”
      </p>
      <p>
        The robot hid his face, not because he wanted to keep living in the
        city, but for the sake of the people who lived there.<br />
        Screams came from the people on top of the bridge who saw him.<br />
        The people next to them were pointing their fingers and shouting.
      </p>
      <p>“Ah. I am a monster.”</p>
      <p>
        For the first time in many years, the robot remembered.<br />
        It was all a dream. He had meant for it all to go well, but from the
        very beginning to the very end, he was not one of them.<br />
        As he sank into the water, he gazed at the crowded bridge with his
        blurring eyesight, and,
      </p>
      <p>“At last. A tear, from the eyes of a man.”</p>
      <p>
        That was the end of the story.<br />
        The voice paused, and a short time passed after it was finished reading.
        If I left things alone, it might go on to the next story. I cleared my
        throat and without bothering to knock opened the door of the office.<br />
        “Oh, Mitsuru-san, you were here. And I thought you were gone for
        sure.”<br />
        After she put the book in her hands on the shelf, the pale girl turned
        to face me.<br />
        “I’d lock up if I was going out. I was just on the roof.”<br />
        “I see. That’s a shame, I should have gone too.”<br />
        Without a trace of shyness, the girl’s smile bloomed like a flower.<br />
        The office was dim, the blinds lowered. Inside was a miraculous
        figure.<br />
        She was about ten. Her long black hair flowed like water. While she had
        the sweetness characteristic of youth, her blue eyes held the light of
        maturity. She favored blouses that were completely out of fashion these
        days, but she was surrounded by a nobility that was untouched by the
        vogue.<br />
        “…”<br />
        I wasn’t the robot from before, but for a moment I could hardly believe
        the radiance I was seeing.<br />
        In a way, this girl was devilish.<br />
        Before this girl, anyone would look forward to her future and at the
        same time wish for her to remain as she was, forever –<br />
        “-What’s with that look? Though you tend to casually reveal your slyness
        even while you’re hiding it.”<br />
        “That was good for being off the cuff. But the last part may have been
        too much. Depending on the listener, they’ll end up suspicious of your
        disposition.”<br />
        The girl smiled like she was enjoying the casual conversation from the
        bottom of her heart.<br />
        “No problem. I don’t get stomachaches from others’ doubts.”<br />
        I replied untidily, and faced my own desk. No matter how beautiful she
        might be, to me this girl was bad luck. If I could, I’d pinch her in the
        neck and fling her out the window like a cat.<br />
        “Feh. You’re in a foul mood again today, Mitsuru-san. I sneaked away
        from my lessons just to come here, but you’re boring me. It’s probably
        because you’re having money troubles again. I even brought you some
        work, too.”<br />
        The girl pouted, looking mildly displeased, but I was the one who wanted
        to bury my face in my hands.<br />
        “… I don’t believe this. I told you not to come here without permission.
        And I know I told you ditching school to come here is beyond ‘causing
        trouble’ and into the realm of ‘intended murder’. It’s a vague feeling,
        but do you want to kill me that much, Lady Mana?”<br />
        “Hmm? Oh, no, I could never do something so pointless. More importantly,
        Mitsuru-san, I don’t like being called ‘Lady’. It makes me feel like I’m
        under someone’s protection, and it’s too formal. Especially in your
        case, Mitsuru-san. I get the feeling you’re being subtly malicious, or
        it’s like your snapping, ‘that’s close enough.’<br />
        … This is an order, but do you mind calling me Mana-kun like when we
        first met?”<br />
        “…….”<br />
        At the young lady’s incomparably anachronistic remarks, I wondered if it
        had all been a joke at my expense, and became even gloomier.<br />
        “Sorry, but I won’t go along with that. It’s not too late yet, so hurry
        up and get back home, Mana. I’m not interested in getting pushed around
        by a ten year old kid.”<br />
        Even as I unkindly knocked away her pursuing hand, the girl’s expression
        brightened further.<br />
        “Yep yep, Mitsuru-san’s good points are also what makes you seem like a
        hoodlum. You like it when I don’t mince words, right? I think you’re
        lacking in sensitivity for a picture book author, though.”<br />
        That was totally unnecessary. Leave me alone.<br />
        This should have come earlier, but I’m Kamekura Mitsuru, a novice
        picture book author.<br />
        I’m twenty-five this year, still no more than a rookie, but for whatever
        reason the magazines always remember me, and I have gotten a few books
        published. And it was all thanks to the previous tenant of this place
        that I had inherited all these connections along with the office.<br />
        “But Tears of a Vampire is a real work of art. You might be the type who
        burns himself out on his first book, Mitsuru-san …The second book, The
        Glowing Cage, was practically a waste of resources…”<br />
        The girl put a finger to her lips uneasily while she searched the
        bookshelf.<br />
        Tears of a Vampire was the title of the short story the girl had been
        reading aloud earlier, as well as my debut work under my own name.<br />
        That one book had saved my life, and was how I had gotten to know this
        girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        … It was exactly two years ago. My debts were piling up from the this
        office’s rent and living expenses, and at last the creditors had come
        calling.<br />
        The problem was that the creditors’ boss was the area representative… of
        a mostly violent criminal syndicate. As the mere mention of their
        surname had me shuddering and contemplating life on a fishing boat or
        oil rig, I was filled with a desire to leave this town, and fast. The
        girl materialized out of that dilemma.<br />
        With a “Mr. Kamekura, this is an honor,” and such, she forced her way
        in, book in hand, and the demonic black-suited young men made their
        exit.<br />
        As soon as I had breathed a sigh of relief, their boss, the Devil
        itself, appeared, and while I looked on dumbfounded, pulled me from the
        jaws of death by making me a member of their group.<br />
        “Perfect. I was just wanting an in-house detective agency. You, you’re
        in charge. You oughta be good at that. Huh, you do picture books? Sure,
        if that’s all it is. I’m not a demon. I’ll let you moonlight at least
        that much.”<br />
        And thus, I found myself running a detective agency – or to put it
        novelistically, I was in the investigative industry – while working on
        picture books, and stripped of my constancy.<br />
        The girl was my benefactor and the big boss’s only daughter.<br />
        So it wasn’t as if I hated the whole thing, but getting unnecessarily
        close was a problem. Frequenting my office may be a novelty and intercut
        the oppressiveness at home, but for once I wish she’d come down with a
        passing fever.
      </p>
      <p>
        “More importantly, Mana, what about the work from the syndicate?”<br />
        Work that came my way was generally background checks that lived up to
        the name of a detective agency, with the hard work stopping just short
        of involving illegal conduct.<br />
        In rare cases, I got wrapped up in affairs that forced me to go along
        with the boss’s viciousness, but most ended quietly. The case the girl
        had brought sounded like something in between.<br />
        They’re keeping the peace… Or so independently requested… Suspicious
        individuals are frequenting the area, it said. It went on: investigate
        said individuals, and if you determine that they’re dangerous, promptly
        request their eviction.<br />
        “… I think there’s been a salesperson hanging out in the back alley.
        They’re probably not dangerous or a dealer, though. I’m not proud of
        this, but there’s no way I could handle someone whose been hitting the
        gym.”<br />
        “That’s not the kind of person they mean. More like a struggling
        fortuneteller. We owe them from way back, so they want you to look after
        them and not bother acting tough.<br />
        I see. Maybe they were pushing this on me because they wanted to avoid
        violence. However –<br />
        “Is this the fortuneteller’s address…?”<br />
        I searched for an old memory of almost ten years ago.<br />
        A shopping district in south Mifune. A fortune teller. Among the
        documents Mana handed over, an old picture of the woman stood out.<br />
        “… Wow. So that old woman’s still alive, huh?”<br />
        “Hm? Do you know her, Mitsuru-san?”<br />
        “A long time ago, I did. Back then she was famous for being accurate
        with her fortunes, but I haven’t heard anything recently. I thought she
        was dead for sure, though.”<br />
        I guess her ability was still active.<br />
        Well… In any case, her physical strength had probably deteriorated.
        Nearly a decade had passed since then. She had to be close to seventy
        now. It couldn’t be easy being a street fortune teller, so it looked
        like she still had a taste for getting involved in other people’s
        destinies.<br />
        “My. It says this person could actually expose the future… really?”<br />
        Looking at the documents surprised Mana.<br />
        She was incredulous, but beyond that her expression said she couldn’t
        understand the meaning of ‘exposing the future’.<br />
        “Yeah. Precognition is generally fake, but she’s the real deal. It’s got
        nothing to do with compiling behavioral information, she’s just a
        unembellished prophet. For one thing, she can expose a person’s future
        even without any prior information.”<br />
        Somehow believing these completely suspicious remarks, the girl’s eyes
        lit up.<br />
        … I felt a headache coming on at my carelessness, but the damage was
        done.<br />
        I didn’t even need to think about what course of action the girl,
        intrigued at my words, would take.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">◇</p>
      <p>
        I waited until night before I went to finish the job.<br />
        South Mifune was the same old shopping district. In ten years, there
        were no noticeably different buildings. At the most, the pachinko
        parlor’s interior was cleaner, so much so, that it improved the
        camouflage that let everyone play with ease.<br />
        “I’m surprised. Adults stay up late, don’t they.”<br />
        The girl, following alongside me with a dance-like step, surveyed the
        night city.<br />
        It was shortly before 11 P.M. I had contacted the girl’s home, so there
        wouldn’t be any hullabaloo over a kidnapping, but I had no doubt I’d be
        questioned by Mr. Suzurigi later. Whatever the circumstances, all of
        this wasn’t so much staying up late as it was the nightlife. As an agent
        of Mana’s education, hard exhortation is a part of his job.<br />
        “Mana, over here. It gets dark from where we’re going from now on, so
        try and stay by my side.”<br />
        With a warning to the girl, we entered the narrow alleyway.<br />
        Beyond the narrow, dark, long alleyway, the dim glow of a lamp’s light
        shone, like the altar of a temple. In the sweltering night, the diviner
        waited in a heavy black robe for customers.
      </p>
      <p>“Welcome. Won’t you step in for a moment, young man?”</p>
      <p>
        Step in nothing; this was the dead end of a blind alley. There was
        nothing past her.<br />
        “Yes! Over here! Hello, Ms. Fortuneteller! Umm, would you mind if the
        other person is underage?”<br />
        “Oh my, I didn’t think that cute voice could belong to such a grim young
        man. Oh, how nice. It’s been a long time since I had a customer who was
        such a lovely child! Of course, of course. And what is the fortune you
        would like to know? Don’t be shy. There’s no charge for young girls.”<br />
        “Thank you very much. Then, could you predict Papa’s and my love
        fortune?”<br />
        Mana faced the fortuneteller without a care. The fortuneteller, with a
        hint of satisfaction on her face, peered into her crystal ball. In her
        movements that had been honed over the decades, I could see a tiredness
        that showed her age. Maybe she had aged a little. Her eyesight had
        deteriorated considerably. It was likely that even the girl right before
        her eyes was murky.<br />
        “Oh my. I don’t need to predict that, do I. It’s mutual love, young
        lady. You’re loved deeply. Any more than that will be a little
        difficult. Ethically.”<br />
        Ethically, huh.<br />
        “Yes. My objective is to defeat Mother one day, and take Papa back.”<br />
        With a smile on her face like a sunflower, the girl uttered a
        head-splitting joke. The conversation had gone completely off the rails,
        but the fortuneteller was in a good mood. Guess it really had been a
        long time since she had any customers.<br />
        “Even the Mother of Mifune has hit rock bottom. Don’t do the whole
        avoiding a unhappy future bit and all of that anymore, huh?”<br />
        In the modern age, there’s a shortage of futures that aren’t unhappy. It
        didn’t matter how the old women saw the future; with happy futures out
        of stock from the beginning, a customer today wasn’t going to be
        satisfied.<br />
        “Oh? My, look who it is. This is nostalgic. You’re in the same line of
        work, yes. No, you were, I should say.”<br />
        The old woman narrowed her eyes and looked at me. …Hit rock bottom? No
        way. With her aged eyesight, she couldn’t even see my face in this
        darkness; she’d have to read minds to do that.<br />
        She was right. Just like the old woman said, I had already –<br />
        “Not you. I was referring to myself. I’ve grown old. I can’t see the
        futures of strangers at all. Your cynicism is correct. The Mother of
        Mifune is all but dead.”<br />
        “Huh? You can’t see the future?”<br />
        Mana looked crestfallen… or rather, curious as she stared into the old
        woman’s face.<br />
        “Yes, I can’t see it anymore. Only bright things. But, that is fine in
        its own way. Now I am much more at ease, and it’s like a great weight
        has been taken of my shoulders. Then again, after that happened, I
        started seeing nothing but the past. Honestly, what sort of karma is
        this?”<br />
        If you have the power to see the future, then obviously you can know the
        past.<br />
        But if that was true, the whole thing was even more depressing.<br />
        Despite her claims to be able to see the past, having no customers meant
        that that genius went unsought.<br />
        No one, no matter how dark their future, wanted to see the drab past.<br />
        “So that’s how it’s been for the last ten years. Old woman, your
        fortunetelling is out of style. Here’s some friendly advice: quit. Don’t
        bother complaining. You’ve, well -”<br />
        The times have left you behind.<br />
        The romance that one could find value in a pure wish had disappeared
        quietly.<br />
        “Oh? And how about you? Have you changed in these ten years?”<br />
        Me? I’d – Hmm, how about that.<br />
        There were things that had changed. In the end, though, it was just that
        one function that was gone.<br />
        These ten years. No, properly, it was twelve. Had I just been blending
        into the life of the city, like the robot who had pretended to be
        human?<br />
        I had made the odd friend, parted, and tried to follow in the footprints
        left behind, a daily life one reader had found fault in.<br />
        “…Yeah. Pathetically enough, I haven’t changed. It’s a waste of
        resources. However you may feel, I don’t find any harm in it. I’ll go on
        being a half-hearted thug.”<br />
        One day. I suddenly felt like I was the robot no longer, but because of
        that my self that was born was unchanged. The change that had happened
        to me, to my life, may have been no different than imposing or not
        imposing upon others; I hadn’t given something yet.<br />
        “That’s not true at all. You’re a good person, Mitsuru-san. Have more
        confidence in yourself.”<br />
        The girl censured me with a serious look.<br />
        “… I’m honored, but what are you basing that on?”<br />
        It was a pointless remark, as always, but this situation called for it.
        I asked anticipating what the answer would be.<br />
        “Why? Because you’re like Papa, Mitsuru-san. Like how you’re plain, and
        how your right eye doesn’t work, and how you’re weak towards women. I’m
        good at using people like that, you know?”<br />
        “…”<br />
        “Ah ha ha ha ha!”, the fortune teller couldn’t help but laugh loudly.<br />
        The most I managed was bearing it without saying anything.<br />
        “You’re laughing too much. You’re old, watch your health.”<br />
        She kept on cackling. Her maltreatment ended after about a minute. Was
        she satisfied, or did she get abdominal cramps? I really hope it was the
        former.<br />
        “Hah, hah, haah… well, live and learn. That boy has gotten pretty human,
        hasn’t he! …Oh, yes. Have you had a good ten years?”<br />
        … I wonder. Even a year ago was unclear, let alone ten. I cherished just
        the good and the bad like they were yesterday, though.<br />
        “Whatever. It’s a nuisance for you to run a business here. Some scary
        faces are going to be coming next, so go into retirement before then.
        It’s not like you need the money, right? You’ve been doing it for free
        since way back.”<br />
        “It’s none of your business. I’ve been doing this since before you were
        born. I may be a nuisance, and I may have no customers, but I’m going to
        keep doing this until the day I die, and that’s all.”<br />
        Negotiations had failed. There was no way she was going to listen what
        someone had to say… and much less what I had to say.<br />
        I hadn’t gotten any results, but I had done my duty where work was
        concerned. The rest was in the gang’s court. Eviction by force was
        exactly what they were best at.<br />
        “We’re going home, Mana. It’s time for kids to get to bed.”<br />
        The girl spoke up.<br />
        “Wait. I have the feeling one thing that I heard was off. Ma’am, you
        said that you were all but dead. And you said that the Mother of Mifune
        was gone. So, why keep fortunetelling? You don’t see the future anymore,
        and you’re at peace now.”<br />
        The fortuneteller’s mouth twisted with irony at the girl’s words.<br />
        It was an expression equal parts bitter smile and nostalgia.<br />
        In a tired voice, the old woman said,<br />
        “I wonder. Now that you mention it, it was only painful, I suppose. My
        life was consumed by the future, and I was left with absolutely nothing…
        Yes. Outside of servicing others, this thing has no purpose at all.<br />
        Like a meager prayer, she spoke of the life she had desired, for
        herself.<br />
        “…”<br />
        It was frail, but her voice was full of pride.<br />
        I had once had my life changed by a certain girl.<br />
        Because of that, I was liberated from a set, visible future.<br />
        In its place was a life full of failure for all I had earned, but even
        then I had things left.<br />
        The old woman had never had such an encounter, and even then she had
        sacrificed herself for the greater good, perhaps.<br />
        “Hey, Mitsuru-san. I have a favor to ask.”<br />
        With a sweet, heavenly smile, the girl looked at me. It was frustrating.
        I hadn’t been able to oppose that smiling face even once to this day.<br />
        “…I’ll listen, but that’s it. Let me hear it.”<br />
        “I think the work of a fortuneteller is amazing. This city needs the
        Mother of Mifune. And I really like her.”<br />
        “Falling in love with absolutely anyone is a bad habit of yours… So?
        What do we do?”<br />
        “Asking a question you already know the answer to is a bad habit of
        yours, Mitsuru-san. Do you still want me to say it?”<br />
        “…That’s enough. I’d get even more depressed if you did.”<br />
        Deceiving Mana’s mother… would be impossible, so I’d persuade her like
        my life depended on it. That wasn’t all. Even though business sure as
        hell wasn’t booming, I’d be supporting the old woman’s work as a
        fortuneteller. It’d mean looking after her until the bitter end.<br />
        “…There’s a whole mess of problems. First of all, how do we know grandma
        here’s going to agree -”<br />
        “Don’t worry about me. I’m just going do what I want to.”<br />
        “See, she’s really motivated too. Glasses-wearing Mitsuru-san can handle
        all of these little problems right? Or maybe we should call you
        Kuramitsu-san then?”<br />
        “…Hey.”<br />
        I put a finger to the sharp pain in my forehead.<br />
        I really didn’t want that name to come up.
      </p>
      <p>
        It happened over ten years ago.<br />
        There was a man who could see a successful future, and thus had no
        choice but to choose that future.<br />
        The man, who no longer knew if he was living in the present or for the
        future, became, after a certain point, a slave for his future’s sake,
        not his own will. A machine with no volition. A robot, that only
        executed a set command that was the future.<br />
        The man became a machine-like bomber, and after five years of earning
        small sums, died at the hands of a killer.<br />
        The bomber… the man who called himself Kuramitsu Merca, was killed
        there. The future that had bound him was cut apart, along with his right
        eye.<br />
        The bomber was defeated, terrified at the death that had pursued him
        right before his eyes. Just when the killer was about to mercilessly end
        the life of the painfully cowering bomber – the killer saw that figure
        and lost all interest, taking her leave like a fickle cat.
      </p>
      <p>
        …It was probably a letdown for her. After all, the man who called
        himself Kuramitsu Merca was too weak.<br />
        The killer moved on, and the bomber, left behind, was taken to the
        hospital.<br />
        That was twelve years ago.<br />
        There were two victims of the bombing incident that occurred at the car
        park.<br />
        One was a man who had protected his family and been slightly injured.<br />
        The other’s right eye had been injured even though they were not in the
        explosion. A fourteen year old child who lost his eyesight.<br />
        I digress. The alias Kuramitsu Merca came out of a comic I happened to
        notice, a villain’s name. It may have been an alias, but as I went by a
        rearranged anagram of my own name, I obviously wanted to preserve at
        least a little of my identity.<br />
        Kuramitsu Merca was no longer here.<br />
        The future was no longer visible.<br />
        Now I was human, merely putting on the act of a one-time seer.
      </p>
      <p>
        “… Yeah, well. It’s more about having a worthwhile framework than
        destroying something”, I muttered despite my bad mood.<br />
        The girl smiled with a face full of trust and took my hand.<br />
        “Of course! Don’t worry, ma’am. He may not be inspired yet, but
        Mitsuru-san’s reliable when he gets serious! You can count on us!”<br />
        “Please wait. I know the name of the young man, but I still haven’t
        heard yours.”<br />
        The girl halted at the fortuneteller’s small breath. She let go of my
        hand, faced her, and properly apologized by bowing.<br />
        “Mana. Ryougi Mana, Ms. Amazing Fortuneteller. Thank you for taking care
        of Mother – no, Father.”<br />
        Just what kind of story was behind that name?<br />
        The old woman stared at the girl with a truly shocked expression this
        time.<br />
        Her unseeing eyes blinked repeatedly.<br />
        “Aaah, is that so. These things happen, don’t they.”<br />
        As if she was looking at something dazzling, or blessing the future to
        come, she smiled gently.<br />
        “So they’re well. I suppose that goes without saying, though.”<br />
        “They’re healthy as can be. Please stay healthy, and keep being
        yourself, ma’am.”<br />
        And then she took my hand with a spring in her step.<br />
        With a glance, I informed the fortuneteller of our departure.<br />
        Strangely, the desk she was sitting at was grand and imposing, changed
        into a powerful existence. Nothing would change after coming here, but I
        had the impression that they were different. Perhaps.<br />
        The woman’s story featured the encounter with the girl and then came to
        its modest conclusion. Even if the former leading lady came off the
        stage, the stage would remain as long as there were customers.<br />
        …That makes for a really busy time, though.<br />
        My story had ended ten years ago, but it seemed there was still a minor
        role for me to play.<br />
        “Let’s go, Mitsuru-san. First we’re going to persuade Mother.”<br />
        “…The biggest obstacle right up front, huh.”<br />
        After all, a robot will move how it moves.<br />
        My future was still full of hope and anxiety.<br />
        Even if this shed no light on the plot, I suppose the stage would keep
        going on, depending on the many central players.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story will go on.<br />
        My destination was vague, but in my left eye I saw it clearly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: right">\Gospel of the Future – Preface</p>
      <p><strong>0\</strong></p>
      <p>January 1996.</p>
      <p>
        Under a sky that even now looked as if it would weep, he was enjoying
        his freedom.<br />
        A rendezvous at midight. A promenade in the dead of night. A killer you
        meet at the intersection.<br />
        Humming those phrases to himself, he strode through the night city.<br />
        Of course it was a secret from her; wearing her favorite red jumper, and
        motivated by a masochistic abandonment, he was filled with a desire to
        kill or be killed, and he prowled the city like a doll that had lost its
        balance.<br />
        She slept deeply.<br />
        In going out into the night city in that space, he felt his own end.
      </p>
      <p>
        The she who had been first to break.<br />
        The self that could only destroy.<br />
        The I that had to be protected.<br />
        The one that had to be protected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suffering from those contradictions was her role, and he was mostly
        unconcerned.<br />
        What could he do to save her? He had perceived the ultimate solution
        already.<br />
        He would have to disappear. Only then could she live happily.<br />
        And thus, he enjoyed the night now with no hesitation.<br />
        Like a dragonfly, singing a paean to what little life it had left.<br />
        And somewhere in his heart, like a child crying that he did not want to
        die.<br />
        “It’s not like I’m really afraid of dying.”<br />
        A lone murmur. It was not pretense. In any case, even if he died, she
        would not. Even if he died, the body would not meet with death.
        Therefore, what he was frightened of was something else.<br />
        The blue sky at lunch, the sunset after class.<br />
        Those, and the dreams he had seen through that boy, were too much for
        him to –
      </p>
      <p>“Welcome. Won’t you step in for a moment, young man?”</p>
      <p>
        He suddenly stopped his feet. In the hand thrust in his pocket was a
        switchblade. Tonight, his mood was at its extreme, so it wouldn’t matter
        as long as there was an excuse.<br />
        The woman who had called out was a fortuneteller.<br />
        He thought he had heard something about her at school, that she enabled
        you to avoid an unlucky future.<br />
        “Hah…”<br />
        You had to laugh.<br />
        Whatever this was, it was getting fun. He put strength into the fingers
        holding the knife.<br />
        Nevertheless, he needed a reason, so he spoke to her merely as a
        gesture.<br />
        “Heh. Interesting. Predict away.”<br />
        He presented his right hand that was not holding the knife. The
        fortuneteller stared at his palm and tilted her head back and forth in
        puzzlement over and over.<br />
        “C’mon, let’s hear the results. How can I avoid my crappy future and all
        of that?”<br />
        He found the diviner boring, and was awaiting her innocuous last words
        when,
      </p>
      <p>
        “…Well, I suppose there are these kinds of futures to. It’s pointless.
        You’re going to die. No matter what you do, no matter what you try, you
        have no future.”
      </p>
      <p>
        That. Even though he had resigned himself, he was entranced by the all
        too early death sentence.<br />
        “… What a surprise. You’re the real deal, huh.”<br />
        “I’m sorry,” the fortuneteller sighed.<br />
        She did all seers proud by still staring at his hand through all of
        this.<br />
        Drained of strength, as if he gone suddenly from hot to cold, he drew in
        his urge to kill along with his freedom.<br />
        The fortuneteller still stared at his future.<br />
        “Come on, enough. The forecast is bleak. I never really thought I’d be
        saved. Actually, this is almost refreshing. This isn’t to thank you, but
        now I’ll leave peacefully.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No, that’s not so. You certainly will die no matter what you do, but…
        it’s rare to have this sort of future.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Huh?”<br />
        The fortuneteller was perplexed.<br />
        Or perhaps, after she had seen everything, she felt sympathetic towards
        him.<br />
        An uncommon precognition. The fortuneteller bestowed with the eye of God
        by some mistake, in a voice lacking confidence in even herself, said,
      </p>
      <p>
        “You will soon disappear. Your way is dark, and there’s nothing you can
        do about your future. Nothing will remain, and nothing will be saved.
        …And yet, it is still strange. Even then, your dream will live on.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She had correctly guessed what the future he had at last desired was.<br />
        “…”<br />
        There was faint joy, and a pain in his chest.<br />
        He made a lonesome laugh and withdrew the hand he had presented.<br />
        “This is it, then. Live as long as you can, old woman. It’s dangerous at
        night here; it’s no place for the elderly.”
      </p>
      <p>◇</p>
      <p>
        In the unseen back alley, an unseen glow was left behind.<br />
        He walked towards the familiar riverbed, and aimed for the estate
        surrounded by the bamboo thicket.<br />
        When he casually raised his face, the sky had begun at last to weep.<br />
        He remembered a certain classmate.<br />
        The whistle he had learned from watching another eventually turned into
        a certain song he had learned by ear.
      </p>
      <p>“…. but, your dream will live on…”</p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, that’s fine then,” was his one pretense.<br />
        Fall in love with someone; she knew that was the answer.<br />
        But, he could only deny, and the things he had yearned for would never
        be his.<br />
        That was the only thing he was afraid of. If her and the boy’s future
        was sworn, then there would be things that would go on, for sure.<br />
        “Ah, well. It’s bleak, but that’s just like me.”<br />
        He laughed innocently, singing in the rain.<br />
        In the pouring rain.<br />
        Dancing alone, he followed the path back home.
