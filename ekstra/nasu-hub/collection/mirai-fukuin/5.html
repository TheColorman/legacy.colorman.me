      <p><strong>1</strong></p>
      <p>
        And so on and so forth – let’s keep that girlish train of thought in
        check.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">◇</div>
      <p>“I see. So that’s why it turned out like that.”</p>
      <p>
        The man with the blackish-green glasses wore a troubled smile. He
        listened carefully to what I said, amazed at how I started crying in the
        middle of the traffic. Or not – he was seriously concerned about me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not the important one here, I just have to worry about this girl –
        that’s what his voice said. A voice, more so than an image, can make my
        mind dizzy – it’s an affinity I have originating from a previous life.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Maybe we take a break at that cafe up ahead, if it’s all right with
        you. You must be tired, too.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He was pointing to a fortress-like cafe, with a hanging sign in German.
        Um, I think it’s read Ahnenerbe. It seemed like a stern place, but
        that’s still much better than talking while standing up.
      </p>
      <p>“Um, yes. T-Thank you very much!”</p>
      <p>I held back those shameful, overflowing tears of mine, and nodded.</p>
      <p>
        For an instant, the snake called wariness rose its head, but after
        thinking for a bit, it lost its interest and coiled back to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though the man had said nothing but pick-up lines, how can someone
        who was the very picture of harmlessness have ulterior motives? No,
        actually, even if he did it would probably work out pretty well. That’s
        the state of mind I’m in right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that even though I’m a coward, in this regard I’m very open – I
        want to do something about this personality.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If, if it isn’t too much of a bother – I, I have something I want to
        say, too…! That is, well, there’s still over one hour until the next
        train, so!”
      </p>
      <p>
        My tears have stopped, but my heart is now running straight into the day
        after tomorrow. Seeing my red face and the way I flustered, the man gave
        another light troubled smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, since I said I’d reward you, it’s my treat. And oh, we still
        haven’t greeted each other yet.”
      </p>
      <p>He gave a belated, simple self-introduction.</p>
      <p>
        His name was Kokutou Mikiya. The instant those sounds reached my ear,
      </p>
      <p>” – I look forward to this year with you, Seo-san.”</p>
      <p>
        I felt them disappear into the depths of my daze – things as yet unseen,
        voices as yet unheard of.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">◇</div>
      <p>
        Cafe Ahnenerbe was decorated by antiques; anyone would feel calm in this
        dark dim space. There were no electric lights, with the interior being
        lit solely by the sunlight from outside, like the chapel of a church.
      </p>
      <p>“…Um, there aren’t really many customers, are there?”</p>
      <p>“That’s true – and it’s before noon, too.”</p>
      <p>
        Mikiya-san gave a strained smile, as though it was a personal matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        …Incredible. I think his appearance has actually turned on its head and
        reached a criminal level of harmlessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Looking the way it does, it’s probably hard for a first time visitor to
        come in. It’s a shame, because the coffee and the cakes are both
        delicious… oh, I see. Would you prefer a brighter shop, Shizune-chan?”
      </p>
      <p>“Shizu-”</p>
      <p>
        Didn’t he just say something incredible right now in a very natural
        way?!
      </p>
      <p>
        “N-No, not at all! I could get used to this mood! In fact, it’s very
        calming!”
      </p>
      <p>“That’s good. Let’s go find a seat by the windows.”</p>
      <p>
        As though enticed by those sweet words, I lowered myself into a seat by
        the windows – opposite of Kokutou-san.
      </p>
      <p>“- Eheh, heh.”</p>
      <p>
        By hiding my embarrassment, my face instead became one of utmost
        stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>“?”</p>
      <p>
        I quickly straightened out my grin. Haven’t I already disposed of this
        peacefully sodden mindset earlier? I shook my head from side to side
        quickly, switching out my emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t because I was tired that I agreed to Kokotou-san’s kind words.
        It was because I had something I wanted to ask from this person I’ve
        never seen before, that I would muster my courage and do something like
        breaking school regulations –
      </p>
      <p>
        “Here’s the menu. The coffee here is hotter than usual, so be careful if
        you’re going to order it. Today’s special is… huh, same as yesterday.
        That’s too bad. The blueberry would’ve made a perfect recommendation.”
      </p>
      <p>– was what I had <em>wanted</em> to do.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing the way the discouraged young man clicked his tongue, my face
        slackened again.
      </p>
      <p>“Ah – n-no, no no!”</p>
      <p>“???”</p>
      <p>Like I said, that’s not what I’m here for!</p>
      <p>
        He’s a stranger that I’ve just gotten to know about ten minutes ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        I summoned my courage to talk to someone who normally I would walk away
        from after giving thanks; but this definitely wasn’t because of a
        childish impulsiveness. In some vague way, I felt a curious connection
        to this Kokutou Mikiya.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t like those ‘usual scenes’ that I was intimately familiar with;
        it felt like I was groping in the dark, trying to confirm something’s
        shape – something like an instinctual feeling of ordinariness, a feeling
        that I had left behind in my childhood.
      </p>
      <p>Kokutou-san ordered coffee, and I asked for an iced cocoa.</p>
      <p>
        In the awkward silence that descended after ordering our drinks, I
        turned off my emotions. I felt a gaze, like I was being controlled by
        the me from five minutes later, making sure that I wouldn’t be hurt no
        matter what answer I may receive.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the time I saw the soft brown colour of our drinks placed before us,
        I was a completely different person from before. My two selves are
        independent. Even though I’m still myself, there isn’t a time, a string
        connecting us at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I wanted to ask you about before. Why did you believe in me,
        Kokutou-san?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Without touching my drink, I put forth a question, looking directly at
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        To him, it might have been just a stranger’s problem, something he
        didn’t really need to care about.
      </p>
      <p>But to me, it was a matter of life and death.</p>
      <p>
        If he ends the conversation with a joke, I’ll probably feel really let
        down, and spend the next week in depression, but at the least, I’ll have
        bid farewell with gratitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Even if you ask me why, it’s hard to answer… hmm. Isn’t it all right if
        I said it was because you were trying so hard?”
      </p>
      <p>“So it was because you pitied me?”</p>
      <p>I was being mean, turning it against him.</p>
      <p>
        If that was why he had looked at me, then there’s no way he would’ve
        chased after the man. It was because he believed me that he chased after
        him… Even though I know this, I wanted to try him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kokutou-san considered it for a while, as though carefully scrutinising.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think there was some pity, too. At first, I made the mistake of
        thinking you were being threatened. But in the end, that’s only my
        personal circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that point, the only thing I understood was that Shizune-chan had no
        reason to lie. It didn’t seem like you had anything to gain by deceiving
        him. In which case, that would mean this girl is seriously worried about
        that man. The authenticity of the accident and so on aside, it was hard
        to ignore it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        And well, something kind of came to mind – Kokutou-san gave a strained
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s not a lie, so you believed me? So you’re just saying it’s good
        intuition – isn’t that a lie and an excuse, too?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, even if it’s like a lie, you were serious, weren’t you? If I can
        believe in the beginning of something, then that’s enough… and, well,
        I’m getting used to these kinds of stories lately.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll trust, not in the contents of the story, but in the essence of the
        person telling it, said Kokutou-san.
      </p>
      <p>
        …That was enough. I, Seo Shizune took a deep breath, becoming so calm
        that even I myself wasn’t sure what to think of it; I opened up to him
        about this worry that I have fostered for many years.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">◇</div>
      <p>“I, can see the future.”</p>
      <p>
        As I had expected, Kokutou-san looked shocked at my blunt confession,
        and sipped from his coffee while it was still black.
      </p>
      <p>“T-This kind of talk is just weird, isn’t it?!”</p>
      <p>Actually, the one that’s weird is me!</p>
      <p>
        ” – No, being surprised is just my personal circumstances, so don’t
        worry. More importantly, what do you mean by seeing the future? Can you
        really watch it like a movie?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Unexpectedly, Kokutou-san became more serious, leaning forward slightly
        as though urging me to continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Um, yes. Like a movie, or maybe I should say it’s like my view just
        gets switched over as-is. It’s like a daze, really.”
      </p>
      <p>“Even now?”</p>
      <p>
        “No, it’s not like I’m always seeing it. Most of the time, it suddenly
        happens with no warning – it feels like a light being switched on, and
        then the view just slips into a different one -”
      </p>
      <p>… it’s hard to explain the “view of the future” in words.</p>
      <p>
        I fall into a daze, and after a blink of eye, I can gaze at ‘events
        which will now happen’ in an objective way – despite this, I feel like
        I’m <em>looking behind myself</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s an uncomfortable feeling, as though I’m seeing the view projected
        into the back mirror, seeing myself in that view.
      </p>
      <p>
        “…Time would feel like it’s going by awfully slowly. But it’s actually
        just a daze for about two seconds – I’ve been starting to think that
        maybe time is actually moving forward and turning back…”
      </p>
      <p>
        That is because all times advance in parallel with each other when the
        observer watches the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        The view of the man’s accident from before was a film almost ten minutes
        long, but in fact I had grasped it in the time it took for me to blink.
      </p>
      <p>“And when did this start?”</p>
      <p>
        While it was taking all my effort just to try and explain, in contrast,
        Kokutou-san was infinitely calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I realised when I was in middle school that I was seeing the future.
        When I was a child, I didn’t know what I was seeing, and I don’t think
        it was ever as precise as it is now.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, that’s a small mercy… would be a rude thing to say. Children have
        hardships of their own. I can only guess what it was like, but there
        were many painful things, weren’t there? You must be very enduring,
        Shizune-chan.”
      </p>
      <p>” – ”</p>
      <p>
        …Oh no, now I feel like crying – being all shamefully flustered again.
        It’s sad, and painful, but even more so, it was happy and difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven’t felt this much pain since the winter of two years ago. It was
        the same as when I came home and saw a childhood friend – my Shiba,
        Chris, on his deathbed.
      </p>
      <p>The chill I felt that time is still burned into my heart.</p>
      <p>Chris was waiting until I got home.</p>
      <p>
        The next morning, Chris passed away sleeping, not in his dog house, but
        as though he was out of sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I watched that view, I couldn’t change the future. I noticed that,
        even if I bring him to the clinic, even if I spent the entire night with
        him, the fact that Chris would be on his deathbed wasn’t swayed. The
        only thing I could do was watch Chris as he ended the way he wanted, and
        cry.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kept crying that night, from the grief of Chris’ death, and from
        happiness in that he would wait for me; the next morning, when I saw
        Chris in the now, I cried again. I had to bear these painful memories,
        just once more than other people.
      </p>
      <p>This person made me remember all this without even referring to it.</p>
      <p>” – Um, please!”</p>
      <p>
        Maybe it was an uncontrollable enthusiasm, or an impulse, but something
        suddenly pushed up and I raised my voice. Across the iced cocoa which I
        still haven’t touched yet, I discovered our enemy.
      </p>
      <p>What is it? Kokutou-san raised his face.</p>
      <p>“I, I don’t mean anything by this…!</p>
      <p>
        But, well. Would you mind if, um, if I called you Mikiya-san from now
        on?!”
      </p>
      <p>It’s like my heart or my tongue became a tattered old pocket watch.</p>
      <p>In response to my stiff voice, Mikiya-san said, all right.</p>
      <p>Yes! The gear in my heart climbed another step.</p>
