    <h1>Gospel of the Future</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>5\</strong></p>
      <p>It was the last day of the summer holidays.</p>
      <p>
        A black-haired Naomi-chan welcomed me back when I returned to the Reien
        Girls College dormitories.
      </p>
      <p>“Hey, welcome back. Anything interesting happen?”</p>
      <p>Naomi-chan was Naomi-chan as usual.</p>
      <p>
        Without breathing even a word of the personal tragedies that occurred to
        her, she was easygoing and languid, behaving like the common modern
        schoolgirl.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There wasn’t anything interesting, but there was one thing that was
        original. I, for the first time, have experienced this thing called a
        broken heart.”
      </p>
      <p>Ahem, I threw out my chest.</p>
      <p>
        Naomi-chan looked at me like I was some kind of rare animal, but, well,
        I’ll let it go this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Wait, broken heart, you mean like unrequited love?! You said there’d
        only be a mass of old people at your familial home, Seo!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “That’s true. I just had a little meeting before going home. Oh, I
        bought the CD. Should I bring it out now?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ah… um, sorry, something a bit different came into my hands. I’ve
        dubbed it, so I’ll give it to you. But leaving that aside, what’s this
        broken heart! Talk about your broken heart!”
      </p>
      <p>
        The bait was so good that she became like a piranha. Reflecting upon the
        beauty and terror of female friendship, I replayed the summer memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hiding away all the comments about precognition, it was a story about
        meeting a man in black-rimmed glasses, in the middle of a certain
        street, getting to know each other because of a trivial coincidence,
        then being together for only an hour for tea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naomi-chan, hearing it from the beginning to the end, gave a single sigh
        of displeasure.
      </p>
      <p>“Oh, was it boring?”</p>
      <p>
        “No, it was interesting. But Seo. It’s hard to say this, but, that’s not
        love.”
      </p>
      <p>Just as I expected.</p>
      <p>I knew those words since three days ago.</p>
      <p>“You think so too, Naomi-chan?”</p>
      <p>
        “Yeah. You were just admiring him. You were just getting enthusiastic at
        an idol, screaming and making a fuss, just a happy fan. Love is more,
        how you say, unprecedented and indecent, and worse, you can’t predict
        it, and it’s like you take a deep breath on a roller coaster and the
        only things left are the collisions and the goal. To be frank, it’s not
        something that would leave behind a clear memory…”
      </p>
      <p>
        Naomi-chan, with a girlishness beyond me, exploded, her circuits going
        full-throttle with her philosophy on love.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn’t even need to be said that I had understood this to be the
        case.
      </p>
      <p>
        My emotion at that time was truly an instant of tender attachment. True,
        I did like him, but it was like I hadn’t thought about anything beyond
        that; really, it was a childish passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, as Naomi-chan said, it was a very happy time. Even if it wasn’t
        love, even if it was a misunderstanding, I’ve decided to always remember
        that hour of that day, as unrequited love.
      </p>
      <p>“Well, whatever. By the way, where’s that man – ”</p>
      <p>Naomi-chan’s question overlapped on the query of the former me.</p>
      <p>The parting on that day had began with that question.</p>
      <div style="text-align: center">◇</div>
      <p>“Um. By the way, where are you from, Kokutou-san?”</p>
      <p>
        “Hm? I was here all the way from middle school to university. Why do you
        ask?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “N-No, I don’t really know, either. I got the feeling I had to ask you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For some reason, I breathed a sigh of relief. A usual bad habit of mine
        appeared, but perhaps this was also a gathering of conditions needed to
        see a more certain future.
      </p>
      <p>– On the other hand.</p>
      <p>
        Mikiya-san fleetingly turned his eye towards what’s outside the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast with the dimly-lit cafe, the street of buildings was
        illuminated by the midsummer rays. There, a slightly conspicuous shadow
        stood. It was a kimono… worn casually with a pongee, a stylish man –
        wait, that’s not
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">\ \ \</div>
      <p>
        Blood. Blood. Blood. An almost tremendous number of jellybeans. Like
        stinging taco sauce. Bloodstained metal, and bloodstained concrete, and
        bloodstained woman, and bloodstained black clothes.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">\ \ \</div>
      <p>” – ”</p>
      <p>
        A daze so severe I’ve never felt one like it before blew away my sense
        of time in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        If my precognition was an operation based on information processing like
        he said, then that person in the kimono was a severe factor that can let
        me easily predict the future just by being there.
      </p>
      <p>“It’s taken quite some time. I should leave soon.”</p>
      <p>Mikiya-san took the chit while looking at his watch.</p>
      <p>
        I frantically gulped down whatever it was in that scene I just saw now –
        no, it was too fragmented to begin with, I couldn’t even make out
        anything specific about it – and shook off my daze.
      </p>
      <p>“T-Thank you very much.”</p>
      <p>As I thanked him, I looked at Mikiya-san with upturned eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Rather than finding fault with how I had not left my seat, Mikiya-san
        waited for me to continue.
      </p>
      <p>Firmly mustering the last piece of courage for today,</p>
      <p>
        “Well… at the beginning, you said that precognition isn’t rare, that you
        know someone like that… is that Kokutou-san’s lover?”
      </p>
      <p>“Come again?!”</p>
      <p>I splendidly stepped onto the land mine myself.</p>
      <p>“Ah, no, um, is she?”</p>
      <p>
        Mikiya-san was shocked even as he looked embarrassed. His gaze was aware
        of the beautiful woman in the kimono outside the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the shock I felt was many times beyond that. Ah, farewell,
        heartbreak. It was too short a dream. After all, there’s no way I can be
        a match against that. Whether it be through brute force or a duel of
        love, there was such a difference in our abilities that if we fought one
        hundred times, I would be killed one hundred and one times.
      </p>
      <p>“That was a shock. Did you see that?”</p>
      <p>
        The behaviour of Mikiya-san, hiding his embarrassment by asking this,
        was, hmm, criminal in various ways. I crumbled down, feeling more and
        more dejected, but there was something much more important than that
        right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        “No, I don’t know so much that I know what kind of person she is… but,
        please listen, and don’t be angry.
      </p>
      <p>
        ….Um. If you keep on going out with that person, you will lose your
        life, Mikiya-san.”
      </p>
      <p>” – ”</p>
      <p>In terms of time, it was about five seconds.</p>
      <p>To me, it was a frozen silence.</p>
      <p>Mikiya-san looked blank, and yet, he definitely did not laugh.</p>
      <p>
        Afterward, when I thought about it, if I were to say that I felt
        unrequited love, it would be this instant that broke my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miki – no, Kokutou-san accepted my precognition with a calm expression.
      </p>
      <p>“I see. Thanks, Shizune-chan.”</p>
      <p>
        The way he was just now, it was something I would never forget for the
        rest of my life… would be saying too much, but if possible, I wouldn’t
        want to forget it for the rest of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was because the explanations and the advices from before weren’t a
        match for this smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        “But please don’t tell me the details. It’s scary, but if I hear it, I
        think I wouldn’t be able to do something important.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The man with the black-rimmed glasses smiled bitterly as he rose from
        his seat.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was saying that, more than his own fate, what he was afraid of was if
        he ran away.
      </p>
      <p>
        To that strength, there was respect and admiration from the bottom of my
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if it was just a meeting of one hour, to me, it was a guide that
        would be difficult to find something to exchange for.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, we separated before the cafe.</p>
      <p>
        Kokutou-san, after seeing me off as I headed towards the station, rose
        his voice to the someone waiting outside the cafe.
      </p>
      <p>
        I watched the two of them from afar while slipping into the crowd,
        murmuring ‘thank you’ one more time, and left the summer streets behind.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">◇</div>
      <p>– The above were the details of the summer.</p>
      <p>
        I can see the future as ever, and I live on day-by-day even as I lose my
        nerves to the sudden bursts of self-hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing has changed and nothing has been resolved, but at least I will
        ignore the act of worrying to the best of my abilities. Like the smile
        that Kokutou-san showed me, if I don’t trust in the me right now, a
        future of joy won’t come.
      </p>
      <p>
        For someone like me who cheats with the future, it is obvious that there
        is a obligation that comes with the cheating.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was because I believe that it will definitely be a good thing for
        someone that I can accept these experiences regardless and without
        discrimination. Just as it was wished, let’s move on facing forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So you know, there had to be an operation, so they totally shaved all
        his hair off, but when that idiot brother woke up, he looked in a mirror
        and said, don’t I look cool without hair? He was trying to pass it off
        with some bull like that! It’s not cool, you’re just bald, what’re you,
        a skinhead? We don’t need a Venusian in the family! I bopped him across
        the head, and the wound opened up again – !”
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I knew it, we were talking about her little brother, and
        Naomi-chan was seriously cheerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        …When she had gone home, with an expression as though the world had
        ended, she must have desperately fought in the passenger plane. A strong
        prayer against the future. Even if what awaited her was an immovable
        fate, with her strength to decidedly see the future with optimism, when
        it ended, the painful past was laughed off as ‘a good thing’.
      </p>
      <p>“You were cool, Naomi-chan.”</p>
      <p>
        “I know, right? Of course it’s better to be cool than cute! Nowadays,
        high-class mistresses or honour students are just annoying. This is
        going to be the age of the cool beauty. Just spare us the baldies!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Then. The wonderful laughing voice of Naomi-chan came to an exact stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her gaze was on something behind me. The newcomer who was making herself
        at home slightly removed from us up until now, came over to our table.
      </p>
      <p>” – You need something?”</p>
      <p>
        Che, Naomi-chan clicked her tongue. Please be silent; how vulgar; her
        enmity was so obvious that I thought she would starting letting loose
        with warnings like that. But.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh no, you just seemed like you seem having fun. Would you mind if I
        joined?”
      </p>
      <p>Contrary to our expectations, she greeted us.</p>
      <p>
        Independent from our confoundment, a first-rate smile appeared on the
        face of the first-year girl; ‘how do you do?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Naomi-chan’s mouth opened and closed as she remained speechless, and I
        saw the future of this girl who seemed to be the concept of ‘young
        mistress’ given form.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh? Could you be Seo-san? This saves me the trouble of going to greet
        you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I, in my own way, was shocked in a different way than Naomi-chan,
        blinking many times, and roughly understood the situation.
      </p>
      <p>It will be a year, no, even longer.</p>
      <p>
        I will share a room with this girl, and live these school lives, filled
        with troubles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most likely, the impression she got that we wouldn’t get along, would be
        overwritten in a single second.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would become roommates, swearing to each other the oaths of a strong
        friendship.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the last night of the summer holiday that I met my dear
        partner-in-crime, one who will eventually stand at the peak of Reien.
      </p>
      <p>Incidentally,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“By the way, where are you from, Kokutou-san?”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>because I ask such questions, she will always become mystified.</p>
      <p>
        It was the same here. I felt relief when I thought it was just the same
        family name; her correcting this mistake was another story, considerably
        further into the future –
