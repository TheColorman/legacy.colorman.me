        Nobody had ever understood Waver Velvet's talent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As a magus, he was neither born of a famous family nor lucky enough to
        meet a good master. Mostly self-taught, he finally got himself accepted
        to the Clock Tower, the teaching arm of the Magus Association that
        controlled magi across the world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver always believed this fact to be incomparably honorable, being very
        proud of his talent. I am the most capable student of the Clock Tower
        since its founding. Anyone would have to respect me. At least Waver
        himself thought this way. In truth, the magus lineage of the Velvets had
        only existed for three generations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As time goes on, the number of Magic Circuits and concentration of
        Crests constantly increase and expand. Many students that receive
        scholarships to the Clock Tower are offspring of families with more than
        six generations of pure magi blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The wonders of magecraft could not be completed within one generation;
        therefore, the results of a whole life of research by parents are passed
        on to their children... only through this could their magecraft become
        more refined. The stronger prana of the old magi families is stronger
        precisely for this reason. Compared to the offspring of well-established
        magi family, Waver's Crest concentration and Magic Circuit quantity
        paled by comparison.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, because a magi's Magic Circuit count is determined at
        birth, there are some ancestral magi families that deliberately contrive
        to increase the amount of Magic Circuits in an offspring, thus
        distancing themselves from new magi families in this regard. In other
        words, advantages within the world of magecraft are predetermined even
        before birth. This is a commonly accepted point of view.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">But Waver did not see it that way.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Differences in ancestry could be made up for by increasing experience.
        Even without exceptional Magic Circuits, the difference between quality
        caused by birth could be bridged through deep understanding and skilled
        utilization of magecraft. Waver had always believed that deeply. He
        believed himself to be an excellent example of that, and had always
        strived to show off his abilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But, the reality was cruel. The workings of the Clock Tower are
        determined by those who boast of their ancestral bloodline, and those
        who endlessly fawn over them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even the lecturers were no exception, only expecting anything from those
        with great lineages. To a "pauper" researcher like Waver, they were
        reluctant to even let him into the library to browse books, let alone
        teach him magecraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Why are the expectations of a magus' future dependent on his lineage?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Why is the credibility of a theory dependent on the experience of one's
        lineage?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nobody cared about Waver's questions. The lecturers used flowery
        language to trick Waver when presented with his research thesis, then
        acted as if Waver had been convinced otherwise, laughing at it, ignoring
        it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It truly is unbelievable. His anxiety drove Waver to take action.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To expose the Magus Association's corrupt system, Waver wrote an
        exposition, " An Inquiry of Magecraft's Path In the New Century.‚Äù The
        result of three years of conceptualization and one year of writing, it
        viciously attacked traditional views, was written with painstaking
        effort, presented clear and intense thought, flawless. If seen by the
        Inquisitors, it would have definitely caused quite the scandal.

      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His name was Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald. He was the heir of the
        Archibald family with nine generations of magus lineage, a very popular
        man that everyone called Lord El-Melloi. Engaged to the daughter of the
        principal, a lecturer at such a young age (needs to say how old he is),
        he was the best of the best. He was also the representative of authority
        that Waver despised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "A man who gives in to delusions such as yourself is not suited for
        research, Waver" - lecturer Kayneth said in a condescending manner,
        without a shred of pity in his voice. Kayneth's ice cold gaze is
        something Waver will never forget.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the nineteen years of Waver's life, he had never been humiliated
        worse.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Kayneth had the talent to be a lecturer, it should have been
        impossible for him to not understand Waver's talent. No, he was probably
        jealous precisely because he understands. He was probably afraid of
        Waver's hidden talent, becoming jealous of him, treating Waver as a
        threat to his own position. That is probably why he treated Waver's
        exposition in such a violent manner. To purposely rip an exposition of
        gathered wisdom... is this the attitude a scholar should assume?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unforgivable. His talent, which could cause the world to tremble, was
        actually arbitrarily written off by an authority. There really is no
        justice. But not one person sympathized with Waver's frustration. The
        Magus Association was actually - in Waver's point of view - already
        corrupt to the core. But... while living these infinitely frustrating
        days, Waver heard a rumor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The rumor was that the reputed Lord El-Melloi, for the sake of adding an
        entry to his resume for his vanity, had decided to join the nearby
        thaumaturgical competition in the far east.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver began researching about the details of this 'Heaven's Feel'
        overnight; he was deeply mesmerized by the horrific details. With the
        wish-granting 'Holy Grail,' summoning Heroic Spirits into the present
        world and commanding them was possible, resulting in a battle to the
        death among their Masters.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Title, authority, everything lost its value: skill was the only factor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It truly was a bit barbaric, but also a simple yet fair method of
        judging superiority. For an unrecognized genius, this was an excellent
        opportunity, an idealistic stage to exhibit himself. Lady Luck had
        finally smiled at the excited Waver.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It began with the financial department's negligence. Lecturer Kayneth's
        requested holy relic from Macedonia was delivered to Waver to give to
        his teacher along with normal parcels, when it should have been a parcel
        opened only when Kayneth himself was present.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver immediately realized that was a catalyst used to summon Servants
        in the Heaven's Feel. And so, he received a once in a lifetime
        opportunity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He no longer had a shred of love left for the corrupt Clock Tower. The
        glory of graduating as a valedictorian was trash compared to the honor
        brought by Fuyuki's Holy Grail. The moment Waver Velvet became
        victorious in the war would be the moment when those insignificant
        members of the Magus Association would grovel at his feet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That day, Waver left England, heading for the island country in the far
        east. The Clock Tower immediately realized who stole Kayneth's parcel,
        but did not chase after him. Nobody knew Waver was interested in the
        Heaven's Feel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But there was something Waver didn't know. Everyone thought he did no
        more than to hide Kayneth's relic in rage. Nobody thought he was on the
        level to knowingly risk his life to participate in a thaumaturgical
        competition. In that aspect, the Clock Tower really had underestimated
        Waver.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the far eastern village, Fuyuki City, the place that would decide his
        destiny, Waver hid under the blanket of the bed, desperately trying to
        hold back his laughter. No, it was impossible to hold back. Illuminated
        by the dim sunlight coming through the cracks of the curtain, he raised
        his right hand every few seconds, letting out some muffled laughter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With the relic in his hands, himself in Fuyuki, and enough quality as a
        magus... How could the Grail turn a blind eye to someone like that?
        Indeed, the pattern of the tripartite Command Seal had clearly
        materialized on Waver's right hand last night, proving that he was a
        Master, one who can summon a Servant. Even the ruckus made by the
        roosters in the courtyard near dawn went unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Waver, breakfast time." The voice of the old woman calling him on the
        stairs sounded different this morning, not as annoying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To begin this commemorable day, Waver quickly began changing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although a backwater place for an island nation, Fuyuki City had a lot
        of tourists from other places. And precisely because of that, Waver's
        appearance, obviously different from that of the Japanese, did not
        attract too much attention. Even so, Waver was cautious and cast a
        suggestion spell on the old couple who had always lived alone, deceiving
        them into thinking that Waver was their grandson. He had very
        successfully used a fake identity to live comfortably here. He didn't
        need to pay hotel fees; it was like killing two birds with one stone.
        Things worked out perfectly; Waver began to have more and more
        admiration for his own ability to adapt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To fully enjoy this mild morning, Waver descended the stairs to the
        first floor kitchen. Like any other morning, the plebeian dining room
        table was decorated with newspapers; the television news and cooking
        welcomed the freeloader openly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Good morning Waver, did you sleep well?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Yes, grandpa. I was sound asleep until morning."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver answered with a smile while he spread jam thickly on his toast.
        The soggy bread that cost only a hundred and eighty yen per

        wasn't very pleasant to chew. Usually, that was very unsatisfactory, so
        it could only be made up for by putting lots of jam on it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Glen and Martha Mackenzie immigrated to Japan from Canada more than
        twenty years ago. But their son could not get used to the Japanese
        lifestyle and went back, creating a family in his home country. Their
        grandson, raised in Japan until he was ten, also went back. Not a single
        letter was sent, let alone a visit. Ten years passed in this manner.
        Discovering that information through hypnosis, Waver decided that that
        kind of family was ideal for him. Through suggestions, Waver transformed
        the old couple's impression of their grandson into his own image,
        successfully becoming their beloved grandson, "Waver Mackenzie."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But Martha, ever since dawn, I felt that the chickens were very
        noisy... would you know why this is?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We have three chickens. Where exactly did they come from...?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hastily making up an excuse, Waver hurriedly swallowed the bread in his
        mouth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ah, that... I have a friend who sent his pet chickens for us to take
        care of for a few days. He's going on a trip and won't be home, so
        they'll be here temporarily. I'm returning them this evening."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ah, so that's how it is."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It seems like they didn't really mind, so the two easily believed it.
        The fact that these two old people were hard of hearing was good for
        him: the incessant crows of the three chickens nearly annoyed the
        surrounding neighbors to death that day.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But the most stressed person was Waver. As soon as he found the Command
        Seals on his hand, Waver excitedly began preparing sacrificial offerings
        needed for the ceremony.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He never thought finding a chicken farm nearby would be so difficult. He
        finally found one, but actually catching three chickens wasted nearly an
        hour. He finally got home just as the sky began to grow bright, covered
        with chicken droppings, hands pecked bloody.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Clock Tower, animals used as sacrificial offerings were always
        prepared. But here, how can a genius magus such as myself be in such a
        piteous state for catching merely three chickens? Having this thought,
        Waver almost cried out in lamentation. But staring at the Command Seals
        on his right hand, his mood began to gradually brighten.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He decided to hold the ceremony tonight. Those annoying chickens could
        at most live until then. And, Waver wanted to have the strongest
        Servant. The relic hidden in the closet of the second floor bedroom...
        That would be the catalyst for summoning a great Heroic Spirit... Waver
        already knew that much.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The withering, half decomposed piece of cloth was a piece of the cape
        that once hung on the shoulder of a king. The legendary "King of
        Conquerors" who destroyed the Achaemenid Empire of Persia and created
        the world's first huge empire spanning from Greece to north western
        India. His Heroic Spirit would descend upon Waver through summoning
        tonight, to guide him to the glorious Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Grandpa, grandma, I'm sending the chickens back to my friend's
        house tonight, so I might be a bit late. Don't worry about me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Okay, be careful. Fuyuki isn't too safe lately."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As in, that fabled serial killer has appeared once more. This world
        really is too scary." Eating cheap sliced bread at that long dining
        table, Waver was surrounded by life's greatest happiness. The noisy
        cries of those chickens were only slightly grating.
