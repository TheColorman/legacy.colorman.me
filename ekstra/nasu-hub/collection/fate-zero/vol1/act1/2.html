      <p class="calibre3">
        The darkness was permeated by a thousand years of ambition. Emiya
        Kiritsugu and Irisviel answered the summons of the head of the Einsbern
        family, rushing to the Einsbern's old castle sealed off by ice, to the
        grandest yet darkest place in it: the ceremony chamber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was definitely not for praising the gods for favors, or letting
        spirits find their peace. As a castle of magi, the so-called ‘prayer
        room’ is used for executing thaumaturgical ceremonies by sacrificial
        offerings. As such, the stained glass does not portray any saint, no,
        but rather the long history of the Einsbern’s pursuit of the Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of the three founding families, the Einsbern spent the most time
        searching for the Grail. They enclosed themselves in the deep, icy
        mountains, severing all ties with the outside world, and began to seek
        the miracles of the Grail a thousand years ago. But their search was
        filled with setbacks and humiliation, suffering and opposition.
        Searching like that, they failed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finally, they grew weary of their solitary search, and agreed to
        cooperate with two outside families, the Tōsaka and Matō, two hundred
        years ago.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Heaven’s Feel rituals that followed, they never won, as their
        Master always fell short. Their solution, nine years ago, was to hire a
        magus specialized in fighting from outside the family.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Emiya Kiritsugu can be said to be the trump card of the Einsbern family,
        ones who have always been proud of their pure bloodline. To accommodate
        him, they changed their family creed, only for the second time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Passing down the halls, Kiritsugu caught sight of a relatively new
        stained window.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On it was drawn the Einsbern’s "Holy Maiden of Winter" Lizleihi
        Justizia, and two magi waiting on her, left and right. All three of them
        extended their hands to the Grail in the sky. It was easy to tell from
        the composition and balance how much the Einsbern looked down on the
        Tōsaka and Matō, and their humiliation on having to rely on them. The
        painting communicated it all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he was lucky enough to win and survive the upcoming war, thought
        Kiritsugu, laughing at himself bitterly, his own image would probably be
        displayed like that on a window, against his will.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The old magus king of this icy castle awaited Kiritsugu and Irisviel in
        front of the sacrificial altar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was Jubstacheit von Einsbern, better known as "Acht" after he became
        the eighth head of the Einsbern family. By prolonging his life, he had
        lived for almost two centuries, leading the Einsberns through every one
        of the Grail wars. He did not remember the Justizia era, but ever since
        the second Heaven’s Feel, old Acht has suffered the pain of defeat many
        times. To him, the anxiety that he feels at this third opportunity for
        the Grail is extraordinary.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The holy relic we requested people to find in Cornwall finally arrived
        this morning." Stroking his white beard like a frozen waterfall, old
        Acht stared at Kiritsugu, an astute light emitting from his deep
        sockets, hiding his senility. Kiritsugu has lived in the old castle for
        a long time; yet, he can never tolerate the bias and pressure he feels
        in Acht’s eyes every time he meets him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Acht’s had indicates the sacrificial altar, which holds a large charchol
        colored box, trussed tightly. “using this as a catalyst, it’s possible
        to summon the strongest Heroic Spirit of the Sword. Kiritsugu, count
        this as the Einsbern family's greatest aid to you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I am deeply grateful, dear head of family." Pretending to be
        expressionless, Kiritsugu bowed deeply.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Grail seems to have accepted the Einsbern family breaking the rules,
        and including blood from outside. The Command Seal appeared on
        Kiritsugu’s right hand three years ago. Soon, he will bear the zealous,
        thousand year old wish of the Einsbern family, and participate in the
        fourth Heaven’s Feel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The old man turned his eyes to Irisviel, who was facing downwards in
        respect. "Irisviel, what's the status of the vessel?" "No problems. Even
        in Fuyuki, it will function normally," Irisviel answered fluently.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The wish granting machine, the omnipotent chalice, is only a spiritual
        entity and does not possess a physical form. To allow its Holy Grail
        form to descend, a vessel for it must be prepared. As such, the war of
        seven Servants for the Grail can be called a spiritual evocation ritual.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The duty of preparing a vessel for the Grail, ever since the beginning
        of the Heaven’s Feel, has been carried out by the Enisbern family. For
        the fourth War, the mission of creating the vessel has fallen to
        Irisviel. Therefore, she must leave for Fuyuki with Kiritsugu: she must
        be at the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Old man Acht, eyes shining with insane strength, nodded seriously. "This
        time... no one must survive. Kill the six Servants; this time we must
        acquire the Third Magic, the Golden Grail."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes sir!" Hearing the burning fervor in the old man’s command, magus
        and homunculus, spouses bearing the same fate, answered simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But in his heart, Kiritsugu could care less about this old head of
        family's rigid desire. Achievement… Acht has condensed all of his
        emotions into this one word, and all of its infinite interpretations.
        Come to think of it… his spirit likely only has this rigidity towards
        achievement left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The materialization of the spirit is a miracle. A thousand years seeking
        this lost miracle... in this long and arduous journey, they have long
        since lost their method and purpose. The Einsbern family continues to
        fight only to prove that their thousand year journey was not wasted,
        only for the confirmation that the miracle does exist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It doesn't matter. As per your expectations, through my hands I will
        grant you your sought-after Holy Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As to not lose to old man Acht's enthusiasm, Emiya Kiritsugu said so in
        his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But that's not all. I will use that omnipotent chalice to grant my own
        deepest wish...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">※※※※※</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu and Irisviel went back to their own rooms, and opened the long
        box entrusted to them by the head of family. They were mesmerized by its
        contents. "Who would've thought... They were actually able to find this
        thing..." The usually composed Kiritsugu right now seems deeply
        impressed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A scabbard made of gold and decorated with dazzling blue enamel. This
        sort of luxurious equipment should be called a treasure, to show dignity
        and nobility like a crown, or a scepter, instead of a weapon. Engraved
        into the middle is an inscription of the long lost Fairy Letters,
        proving this scabbard is not a work of man.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Why isn't there the slightest flaw? Is this really the genuine
        relic made from an era over one thousand five hundred years ago?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This thing is a type of Conceptual Weapon. It definitely won't
        deteriorate physically, not mentioning that it's a holy relic that will
        be used as a catalyst. This treasure lies in the realm of magic."
        Irisviel took out the golden scabbard from the lined box carefully,
        holding it in her hands. "Legend says keeping this scabbard on one's
        body will heal the wounds of its possessor and can stop aging... of
        course, the mentioned facts are magical powers provided by its 'original
        owner.’ Meaning as long as the Heroic Spirit summoned is functional,
        this thing itself can be used as a 'Master's Noble Phantasm.'"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The scabbard’s one-of-a-kind ingenious design and exceptional beauty
        entranced Kiritsugu, but in just a few moments, his train of thought
        immediately changed to the direction of how to use it as a pragmatic
        'tool.'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Watching Kiritsugu, Irisviel can't help but let out a small bitter
        smile. "That's really your style. A tool is a tool no matter what,
        right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you say it like that, even Servants are the same. No matter how
        famous the hero, as long as it is summoned as a Servant, to the Master
        he is a tool. It is impossible for a person who has unrealistic
        fantasies about a Servant to win this war."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When showing his aspect as a soldier, Emiya Kiritsugu’s profile becomes
        rock hard and callous, quite unlike him as a father and a husband.
        Before, when Irisviel didn’t understand him, she was truly afraid of
        that side of him. "Only someone like you is worthy of this scabbard --
        this is grandfather's judgment."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is that really how it is?" Kiritsugu's expression shows obvious
        dissatisfaction. If Acht knew the reaction of his hired son-in-law to
        the holy relic he spent so much effort finding, he would certainly be
        unable to speak from rage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Are you unsatisfied about grandfather's present?" Irisviel did not
        blame Kiritsugu at all for wanting to make impertinent remarks, but only
        thought that asking that question would be amusing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How can that be? He has done more than enough for us. There cannot
        possibly be another Master who got a trump card as good as this."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Then what are you so unsatisfied about?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "With such a perfect holy relic, the summoned heroic spirit will
        definitely be the one we want. But his and my personalities are too
        vastly different. Originally, the nature of the summoned Servant will be
        affected by the Master’s personality. In theory, all Servants have
        similar personalities to their Masters’. However, this holy relic takes
        priority. The more exact the nature of the relic, the more likely it is
        that the summoned Servant will be locked as a certain spirit.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Meaning that you are uneasy about the contract with the 'King of
        Knights,' right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of course. There probably isn't anyone in the world who is more
        incompatible with the ways of the knight." Half jokingly, Kiritsugu's
        lips curled in a slight smile. "A head-to-head battle is not my style,
        especially in a death match. If I am to attack, then it should be from
        behind while the enemy is asleep. Not caring about the time or place,
        just for the purpose of eliminating the enemy most efficiently, using
        the method with the greatest probability of success... You think that
        prestigious knight would aid me in such battles?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel became silent, focusing on staring at the shiny scabbard.
        Without a doubt Kiritsugu was that type of soldier: attaining victory by
        any means necessary. There is no need to test it; the personalities of
        Kiritsugu and the owner of the scabbard would definitely clash.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... But don't you think it's a waste? The owner of 'Excalibur' is
        without a doubt the strongest of the Saber Class."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That is correct. Only this glory-radiating scabbard is fit to pair that
        supreme sword. This is definitely the relic of that King of Knights
        whose tale has been passed down in legends since medieval times - King
        Arthur.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right 'Saber' was already the strongest of the seven classes
        conjured by the Holy Grail. And if this King of Knights occupied this
        position... I've obtained a virtually invincible Servant. But the key
        here is the question of how to use this strongest battle force
        effectively. To be honest, if only the factor of being easy to control
        was considered, 'Caster' and 'Assassin' are actually more fitting to my
        style."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then -- clashing with the nandi flame-style, extravagant decor of the
        room, a light electronic sound interrupted the two's conversation. "Ah,
        finally here."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the heavy black sandalwood table was a randomly placed notebook
        computer; the marvelous combination was like that of a stitching machine
        on an operating table. Magus lineages with long histories have never
        found the convenience of technology. The Einsbern family is no
        exception. The small electronic device that looks strange beyond compare
        to Irisviel is a personal item brought in by Kiritsugu. A magus who does
        not feel repulsed from using such machines is very rare; Kiritsugu was
        one of them. When he requested that a telephone line and power generator
        be installed, he had a huge argument with the old head. "...That sound,
        what is it?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The report sent from the fellow that infiltrated the London Clock
        Tower. I asked him to investigate the status of the participating
        Masters in this Heaven's Feel."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu sat in front of the machine and began operating the keyboard
        skillfully. The LCD monitor displays one new mail. That is the new
        technology commonly known as the "Internet" in the cities, which
        Kiritsugu has already explained to Irisviel. But, her patience shows
        that she does not comprehend a bit of it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...Oh, there's information on the identities of four Masters."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tōsaka participant is obviously the head of family Tōsaka Tokiomi. A
        thorny person of the 'fire' attribute who specializes in jewel
        magecraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Matō family seems to have forced that failure who couldn't succeed
        as the head of family into being a Master, what nonsense... but the old
        fogy of that family is exerting great effort to gain the grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the magi coming from out of town, first of all, there's the
        first-rate lecturer from the Clock Tower, Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald.
        Ah, he knows about this man. Having both 'wind' and 'water' attributes,
        an expert who is proficient in spiritual evocation, summoning, and
        alchemy. He is currently the most renowned magus in the Association. How
        troublesome.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And there's a man sent by the Holy Church... Kotomine Kirei. Originally
        the representative of the 'Assembly of the 8th Sacrament,' he is the son
        of the one who fulfills the role of supervisor - Kotomine Risei. Sent to
        Tōsaka Tokiomi to learn magecraft three years ago, and then broke away
        from his teacher after being granted the Command Seals. Hmph, a fellow
        filled with the smell of gunpowder.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu browsed the detailed contents of the investigation; watching
        her husband, Irisviel was extremely bored. Suddenly, she noticed that
        Kiritsugu, who had been staring at the screen, had quite serious and
        tense expression. "...What's wrong?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This son of Father Kotomine. Even his past has been cleaned." Irisviel
        stood behind Kiritsugu and looked at the LCD monitor, following his
        finger. To Irisviel, looking at text not on paper was very difficult,
        but considering her husband's serious expression, she did not complain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...Kotomine Kirei. Born in 1967, accompanying his father Risei to the
        holy grounds since youth, graduating in '81 from the Theological College
        of Manresa St. Ignacio... skipping two grades, and was the student
        council president; he seems to be quite an accomplished man."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu nodded unhappily. "He could've definitely reached the position
        of cardinal minister like that, but he willingly abandoned this
        outstanding opportunity to join the Holy Church. In fact, he had lots of
        choices, so why did he chose to dedicate himself to such an inside
        organization of the church?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Perhaps he was influenced by his father? Kotomine Risei is part of the
        Holy Church too, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If that's the case, then he should have had the goal of retrieving lost
        holy relics like his father all along. Indeed, Kirei did join the same
        department as his father in the end, but before that, he was transferred
        three times and was once chosen as an 'Executor.' He was only
        ten-something years old then too. This job cannot be done without a
        certain amount of willpower." That was the Holy Church's bloodiest
        department, called the Shura's Den for its responsibility of punishing
        heresies. To be able to gain the title of "Executor" would mean that he
        is a first-rate murderer, signifying that he has passed brutal and pious
        training to become mankind's weapon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Perhaps he is a faith fanatic. The younger the purer; such a thing as
        having a fanatic love for belief surpassing certain limits exists."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even after hearing Irisviel's opinion, Kiritsugu still shook his head.
        "It's not like that... if it was, then this guy's situation of the past
        three years cannot be explained. If his faith was chaste, it would be
        impossible for him to transfer into the Magus Association; it seems to
        be an order from the Holy Church, or it's possible that he was more
        faithful to the religious doctrine than the organization. But even this
        cannot explain it, because there is no necessity to train in thaumaturgy
        this seriously. Look, Tōsaka Tokiomi's report about Kirei given to the
        Association. The scope of training includes alchemy, spiritual
        evocation, summoning, divination... he is even more adept at healing
        magecraft than Tōsaka Tokiomi. What exactly is the reason for this
        enthusiasm?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel continued reading the document, all the way to the end where
        Kotomine Kirei's ability summary was. "...I say, this Kirei really is
        kind of strange, but is it worth it for you to scrutinize to this
        degree? Although he seems to be very talented, he's not really a cut
        above other people."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ah, that's what I find strange." Looking at the uncomprehending
        Irisviel, Kiritsugu patiently explained. "No matter what this man does,
        he cannot reach the 'first-rate' level. When it comes down to it, he's
        not some sort of genius, just a normal man. But his achievement of quick
        results through complete and total effort is indeed scary. Certainly he
        has to exert ten or twenty times more effort than other people to
        achieve this level, but he actually stops when there's only one step
        left, and then without any lingering love transfers into another region.
        All the things he raised laboriously all along are tossed out like
        trash."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "He clearly chose a lifestyle many times more exciting than that of
        others, but in this man's life, he has never let others feel
        'affection'. This guy - is definitely a dangerous man," Kiritsugu
        concluded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel understood the meaning contained within his words. When he says
        "troublesome", although the opponent is very thorny, he actually is not
        seeing the opponent as a threat. The method of dealing with this type of
        opponent and the chance of success, Kiritsugu is already eighty percent
        assured. But when he uses the rating of "dangerous"... Emiya Kiritsugu
        only uses this rating against opponents he need to fight
        whole-heartedly.

        "This man certainly does not believe anything. Only continuously seeking
        answers, that's why he experienced so much. The result is he still did
        not find anything... he is that kind of morally void man. If I had to
        say what this guy's heart contains, then it's probably only anger and
        despair."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...You are saying, to you this Executor is a more powerful foe than
        Tōsaka Tokiomi and Archibald?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Pausing for a while, Kiritsugu nodded resolutely. "...A terrifying man.
        Indeed Tōsaka and Lord El-Melloi are strong adversaries. But I think
        Kotomine Kirei's 'way of existence' is more fearful."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Way of existence?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This man's heart is thoroughly void. He has nothing that can be called
        a wish. But why would a man like this bet his life to fight for the
        Grail?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...Is this not the intent of the Holy Church? Supposedly those guys
        mistakenly believed Fuyuki's Grail is the real relic and targeted it
        because of this, isn't that right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No, only with that level of motivation, the Grail will not grant
        Command Seals. This man was chosen by the Grail as a Master. He must
        have some reason to obtain the Grail. What this reason really is,
        precisely because it cannot be seen... that's what makes this point
        terrifying."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu sighed deeply, looking at the monitor drearily, attempting to
        find something more from the character of Kotomine Kirei fabricated by
        dull text. "What do you think would happen if this kind of void,
        desireless man obtained the Grail? This man's whole life was built by
        despair. The power of the wish-granting machine, the Holy Grail might be
        tainted by the color of his despair."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu was being too indulgent of his sadness, and for the purpose of
        advising him, Irisviel shook her head strongly. "What's stored within
        me, the vessel of the Grail, I will not give to anyone. When the Grail
        is filled, the one who has the privilege of owning it - it's only you,
        Kiritsugu."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The elders of the Einsbern only wish for the completion of the Grail;
        that is their sole desire... but for this young couple, after this, they
        still have wishes that need realization. Dreams that need realization.
        Kiritsugu shut the lid of the notebook computer and hugged Irisviel
        tightly. "No matter what, we can't lose."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For his wife, right now compared to her family's desire, Irisviel cares
        more about her and her husband's ambition. This fact deeply moved
        Kiritsugu. "...I got it. The way to use the strongest Servant's power to
        the maximum limit."
