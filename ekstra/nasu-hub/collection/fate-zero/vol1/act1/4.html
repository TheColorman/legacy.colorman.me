      <p class="calibre3">
        Matō Kariya’s mental strength had, in conclusion, withstood the bitter
        pain, but his physical body had reached its limit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Within three months all his hair had turned white. His skin was covered
        with emerging lesions interspersed with regions devoid of the rosy color
        of living flesh, turning instead into a sepulchral shade of earthen
        grey. The poison named prana that circulated in his veins can be seen to
        expand beneath his semi-transparent flesh, as if his torso was harboring
        a crawling mess of inky black cracks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like so, his body collapsed at a rate faster than he had ever imagined.
        The impact was particularly heavy on the left side of his body and its
        nerves, so much so that at one stage his left wrist and ankle were
        completely paralyzed. A temporary rehabilitation program got them back
        to work, but the left hand still reacted slower than the right, and a
        quicker stride would result in a dragging left feet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Palpitations due to his irregular pulse have become regulars for him.
        Solid food can also not be taken in; intravenous glucose injections were
        used as its substitute.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to the theories of modern medicine, it is a matter of
        amazement that a creature in his state still continued to live and
        function. Although Kariya can still stand and walk it was, with a tint
        of irony, a gift granted to him by the prana that he, as a magus, bought
        with his life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The crest worms that have been invading Kariya’s flesh have already
        grown into a form that can imitate the function of Magic Circuits. In
        order to maintain the life of their decaying possessor they are now
        desperately acting out their role.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it is simply a matter of the amount of Magic Circuits, then Kariya
        have already possessed the prana needed for qualifying as a magus. It
        appears that his progress was even faster than what Matō Zōken had
        expected. In the end, the three scars of the Command Seals had blatantly
        shown up on Kariya’s right hand. The Holy Grail also seems to have
        accepted him as the representative of the Matō family.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Based on Zōken’s estimations, Kariya has about a month left to live. For
        Kariya, it seems that this amount of time is enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heaven’s Feel has entered into its countdown stage. If all seven
        Servants are summoned the war may even begin tomorrow. The duration of
        the war, according to past experiences, should be about two weeks.
        Sometime before Kariya’s death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yet, if Kariya activates his Magic Circuits, it means he will be
        inciting the crest worms. Indeed, then the burden placed on his body
        would be far greater than that of the other magi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The worst case scenario would be that, before the war has ended, the
        crest worms have already devoured their host.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya does not only have to fight against the other six Masters. It
        could be said that his greatest enemy are the creatures hosted within
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre5">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That night, as Kariya approached the basement of the Matō residence to
        face the final test, he accidentally met Sakura in the corridor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The frightened expression that emerged on Sakura’s face when she first
        saw him slightly pricked Kariya’s chest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this stage of affairs, although there is nothing to be done, Kariya
        was still pained to know that he was now an object of Sakura’s fear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">‘Oh, Sakura-chan &ndash; were you scared?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Um. Your face, what happened?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ah. It’s just a little problem.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sight of his left eye has been completely eradicated yesterday. Like
        the nebulous eyeball that had undergone necrosis, the surrounding
        muscles also have fallen into paralysis. The eyelid and brow cannot be
        moved, neither; maybe the left side of his face was already showing
        signs of lifelessness, turning rigid as a fake mask. His reflection in
        the mirror frightens even him, let alone Sakura.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Just a bit more, then I might be defeated by the ‘worms’ within me.
        Uncle is not as enduring as Sakura-chan.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A bitter smile was intended, but looked like a more gruesome feature was
        formed. Sakura became more scared and even curled her body up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Uncle Kariya, you are like a different person now.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ha ha, maybe that is the case.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a dry laugh as pretense the matter was vaguely passed over.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">&ndash; I can say the same about you, Sakura.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Yes, Kariya comment wearily in his heart.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Sakura that is now named Matō has also changed into a girl
        completely different from the Sakura that Kariya knew.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A gaze as hollow and dim as that of a doll. The various emotions behind
        those pair of eyes were never seen by him in this whole year. The
        innocent face of the girl that followed her elder sister Rin and played
        carelessly like a puppy had long ago disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is understandable. Just consider the cruel training that Sakura
        undertook this year in order to become the successor of the thaumaturgy
        of the Matōs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sakura’s body does indeed have fitting potentials to become a magus. On
        this matter she was far better than Kariya and his elder brother
        Byakuya. Yet, it was inevitably a potential more appropriate for a magus
        of the Tōsaka brand of thaumaturgy, with fundamental differences to the
        thaumaturgy of the Matō.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Acclimatization was needed in order to allow Sakura’s body to adapt to
        the thaumaturgy of the Matō. The treatments of this so called
        acclimatization are the tortures that occurred in the underground worm
        storage of the Matō residence every day and night in the name of
        "education."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Children’s minds are immature.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They do not possess a firm resolve and the strength to turn their misery
        to anger. Confronted with a cruel fate, they were not provided with the
        choice of having a strong will. Moreover, as they have not lived through
        and comprehended life, ideals such as honor and hope are yet to be
        completely nurtured in them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore in moments of despair children are more prone than adults to
        seal away their own mind, lock up their own heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because they have not tasted the joy of life they can afford to discard.
        Because they have not understood the meaning of future they can sink
        into despair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya was forced to witness, with his own eyes, how in the duration of
        a year a girl had gradually shut out her heart due to the torments
        imposed upon her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had suffered from the piercing pain of the parasite worms eroding
        away his body, and suffered from the worse and overwhelming guilt that
        sought to devour his soul.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Undoubtedly he was one of the reasons that resulted in Sakura’s anguish.
        Kariya cursed Matō Zōken, cursed Tōsaka Tokiomi, and in the same time
        placed this curse upon himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only consolation was that &ndash; the Sakura that has turned as
        introverted as a doll was only carefree when with Kariya, and even
        occasionally uttering words of innocence when they met. Whether it was a
        relationship shared by those who endure the same pain, or a friendship
        forged while she was still called Tōsaka Sakura, this girl continued to
        regard him as different compared to her ‘tutors,' Zōken and Byakuya.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I don’t need to go to the worm storage room today. Grandfather said
        that’s because something more important is going to happen there.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah, I know. That’s why uncle is taking your place to go to the worm
        storage.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sakura tilted her head as if she was spying on Kariya when she heard his
        answer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Uncle Kariya, are you leaving for somewhere far away?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a child’s distinctively sharp intuition Sakura seemed to have
        detected Kariya’s fate. But he did not want to worry the young Sakura
        too much.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Uncle’s going to be busy with important business for a while, so I
        won’t have much time to talk to Sakura-chan like this.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Is that so…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sakura moved her sight away from Kariya and it immediately reverted back
        to a meaningless gaze, a gaze that was focused on some distant object
        that only she could see. Hurt at seeing Sakura like this, Kariya
        attempted to start another topic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Say, Sakura-chan, shall we play together again when uncle’s work is
        finished? Together with your mother and big sister.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Mother, big sister..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Sakura said dejectedly after a pause.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “...I don’t have people that I can call by those names anymore.
        Grandfather told me that I should treat them as no longer existing.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I see…” A reply with an indecisive voice.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya knelt down in front of Sakura, and with his still mobile right
        hand held her shoulders softly in an embrace. With her head buried in
        his chest Sakura can no longer see Kariya’s face. He would therefore not
        be afraid of her seeing his crying countenance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Then, let’s bring Aoi-san and Rin-chan from the Tōsaka family, and go
        somewhere far far away with just the four of us; like how we used to.
        What do you say about that?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; Can we see those people again?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A weak voiced sounded within the enclosure of his wrist. Kariya
        tightened the hand that held Sakura and nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Of course we can see them again. I promise you.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Nothing else can be promised.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it is possible, then other words can be used for another promise. If
        he could, Kariya longed to tell Sakura right now that she only has to
        endure a few more days before he delivers her from Matō Zōken’s deadly
        grasp.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">But that is not permitted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the only way she knew how to protect herself, Sakura had tried hard
        to paralyze her mind through despair and resignation. In order to
        counter the unbearable pain, the hapless girl can only destroy the sense
        of self that is still able to feel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        How can you say cruel words such as ‘you should keep hoping’ and ‘you
        should look after yourself’ to a child like this? These lines that
        confer temporary solace can only save the speaker. Giving her hope means
        to take away the armor named ‘despair’ that was cast upon her soul. If
        that is to happen, Sakura’s young and tender mind would collapse within
        a night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Therefore &ndash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although they both lived in the Matō residence Kariya had never claimed
        to be Sakura’s ‘savior.' He can only protect her by standing beside her,
        as an adult that is also been ‘bullied’ by Zōken and as powerless as
        Sakura.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; Goodbye then. Uncle’s gotta go now.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya released Sakura, hoping that his tears have dried up. Sakura
        looked up solemnly at the decaying left side of Kariya’s face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…Mm, bye, uncle Kariya.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Words of farewell seemed appropriate for this situation. She had
        accurately felt this even though she was only a child.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya prayed piously in his heart as he watched Sakura’s retreating
        spiritless figure &ndash; please do not let it be too late.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya no longer cared about anything concerning himself. His life was
        already given to Aoi and Sakura, the pair of mother and daughter. If he
        had anything of his own that might be ‘too late,' it is the possibility
        that he might be dead before he had taken the Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The delay that he was truly worried in his heart was about Sakura. If
        Kariya can successfully gain the Holy Grail and deliver Sakura back to
        her mother, can the girl who had sealed herself up tightly with despair
        one day break apart her solid shell and once again enter the world
        outside?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The heartaches that Sakura endured this year would undoubtedly follow
        her throughout her life, but he hoped it would gradually heal as time
        went on. He hoped that her heart was not given torments that equated to
        a deadly blow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All that is left for him to do is to pray. The one that can heal the
        wounds in this girl’s heart is not Kariya. There is not much time left
        for him; he is unable to take up that job.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That is a job for those whom, in the future, are guaranteed of their
        lives.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya turned around and slowly, but resolutely, took a step on the
        staircase leading towards the worm storage room underground.
