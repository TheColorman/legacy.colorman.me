      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, at the far away land of the east across the sea,
        another person is receiving the same report by the spy in England as
        Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Being a legitimate magus, Tōsaka Tokiomi would not resort to using the
        new technology of the vulgar world like Kiritsugu. He is adept at using
        the Tōsaka family's exclusive secret technique of communicating over
        long distances, a jewel magic passed down through the generations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Towering in Miyama-chou of Fuyuki is the Tōsaka mansion. In Tokiomi's
        workshop set up below ground, an installment of experimental equipment
        similar to what is commonly known as the black pendulum was prepared.
        The difference between common physics experimental equipment and this is
        that, this pendulum's massive bob contains a magic jewel of the Tōsaka
        heirloom, and it was constructed so the ink flowing down from the string
        can moisten the jewel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The rock paired with the jewel of this pendulum is currently in the
        possession of Tōsaka's spy. If this rock was placed in front of a roller
        and start writing, the matching pendulum's jewel would start to
        undulate, the ink dripping down would write perfect and errorless text
        on the Rollin paper underneath. That's the type of structure it was.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now the jewel on the pendulum and the rock on the other side of
        the globe in London are undulating in sync, and through watching this
        strange repetitive motion without a pattern, the reporter's writing
        began to smoothly and accurately resurface.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi, noticing this occurrence, picked up the paper without waiting
        for the ink to completely dry and began browsing what was recorded on
        it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "&mdash; No matter how many times I look at this setup it always make me
        feel like it's unreliable."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kotomine Kirei, who's been standing guard off to the side all this time,
        expressed unscrupulous sentiments.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh, so do you think fax is more convenient?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If this method was used, even if the power was out, there won't be any
        breakdowns. There's also no need to worry about the report being
        divulged. Without the need to rely on new technology, us magi have long
        ago possessed apparatus not inferior to modern tools today."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even so, as Kirei sees it, fax that can be used by anyone is more
        convenient. 'Anyone' can use it... this inevitability is definitely
        something that Tokiomi cannot comprehend. It's perfectly reasonable that
        the techniques and knowledge of aristocrats and commoners are
        different... even in the present, Tokiomi still bears this outdated mode
        of thinking; he is truly a legitimate 'magus.'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The latest report from the 'Clock Tower.' The 'prodigy' Lord El-Melloi
        seems to have obtained a lost relic. If that's the case, then it is
        confirmed that he will be participating. Hmph, this is truly a thorny
        opponent. So it's clear, there are now five Masters including myself..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It really makes me worry that there's still two positions empty until
        even now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why, it simply means that there are no suitable bearers for the Command
        Seals. When time is running out, the Grail will randomly fill the seven
        slots regardless of quality. For the sake of having enough people, there
        should be two small characters. There's no need to be alert."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That's really suited to Tokiomi's optimism. Having been his student for
        three years, Kirei now understands his master very well. Although he's
        very thorough in preparation, he has a habit of missing small details
        once in action, and taking care of these small details in his stead is
        probably his responsibility; Kirei has long since understood this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But speaking of being careful - Kirei, nobody saw you as you entered
        this house, right? In appearance, we're already enemies."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Completely according to Tōsaka Tokiomi's plan, the reality was twisted
        and announced. Kirei, who had been chosen by the Grail three years ago,
        carefully hid the insignia on his right hand according to Tokiomi's
        order, all the way up until this month before he announced the fact that
        the Command Seal is present on his hand. From that moment on, he severed
        his ties with Tokiomi as a contender for the Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No need to worry. Regardless of being able to see or not, there are no
        familiars or spells surveying this house. I &mdash;"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"&mdash; I guarantee that."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The voice of the third person cut in and, at the same time, a black
        shadow appeared beside Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heroic Spirit that's been accompanying Kirei in spirit form all this
        time has, at this moment, appeared in front of Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That skinny and tall shadow has a great difference in prana compared to
        humans. He's 'something inhuman.' A strange one wearing a long black
        cloak and a white skull-like mask to shield his features.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yes, he is the first Heroic Spirit to be summoned in the fourth Heaven's
        Feel, the Servant "Assassin" who made a contract with Kotomine Kirei
        &mdash; Hassan-i Sabbāh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No matter what tricks they play, they cannot hide it from my eyes, the
        eyes of the Heroic Spirit of Subterfuge, Hassan. My Master, Kirei, does
        not have any aura of being followed by an enemy around him... you can
        relax."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if understanding Tokiomi's position was higher than that of his own
        master Kotomine Kirei, Assassin politely reported with a bow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">And then Kirei said,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As soon as a Grail-summoned Heroic Spirit appears, no matter which
        Class it belongs to, it would definitely be reported to father
        accurately and without error."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Father Risei was the supervisor of the Heaven's Feel, appointed as the
        head priest of and dispatched to the Fuyuki Church. Currently, he is in
        possession of a magical device known as the "spirit board." It has the
        function of displaying the attributes of the Heroic Spirits summoned by
        the Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The identity of Masters can only be confirmed by reports from people,
        but the quantity and Class of appearing Servants, no matter where they
        are summoned, will definitely be displayed on the "spirit board," to
        grant the supervisor better control of the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "According to my father, my Assassin is the only Servant to have been
        summoned so far. Other magi taking action is still yet to come."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yeah. But this is only a matter of timing. Sooner or later, there will
        be familiars of other Masters coming and going around this room. Because
        here and the Matō mansion, as well as Einsbern's dwelling, are already
        confirmed locations of Masters."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to the three imperial families, the advantage of foreign magi
        is that their place of concealment is unknown to others. Because of
        this, during the early stages of the Heaven's Feel, no matter what
        family it is, they will use spies for reconnaissance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It's not like Kirei distrusts Tokiomi's information network, it's just
        that they have to be on guard for the possibility that the remaining two
        mystery Masters are using wise measures to conceal themselves. If facing
        against an opponent with this kind of strategy, Kirei's Servant Assassin
        can utilize his powers to the greatest limit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You may leave. Assassin, continue keeping watch outside. Be very
        cautious."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Understood."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Receiving Kirei's command, Assassin once again assumed spirit form and
        left the room. For a Servant who is a spiritual entity to begin with, it
        is possible to shift freely between spirit form and physical form.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Assassin has the special ability of "Presence Concealment" that other
        Classes do not possess. He is unrivaled in concealed movement and
        tracking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To Kirei, whose responsibility is not to pursue victory but to provide
        backup for Tokiomi, summoning Assassin was the best choice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">That is the battle plan.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        First, let Kirei's Assassin go around thoroughly investigating the
        battle stratagem of other Masters and their Servants' weaknesses. After
        obtaining a method of certain victory against each enemy in this manner,
        Tokiomi's Servant will then be used to defeat each one accordingly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of this, Tokiomi must summon a Servant possessing great
        offensive abilities. As for which Heroic Spirit he has his eye on, Kirei
        never heard him mention this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The holy relic I prepared will arrive tomorrow morning."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if understanding Kirei's doubts from his expression, Tokiomi said so
        without waiting for him to ask.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I found what I was expecting. The Servant I will summon would certainly
        be advantageous against all of the enemies. If it is a Heroic Spirit,
        then it will have no chance of victory against this guy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi, being secretly happy in this manner; his face was brimming with
        the unrivaled confidence he was born with.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The summoning ceremony will be held tonight -- if no other Masters are
        spying on us, Kirei, you can be present too, as well as your father."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Father too?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes. If 'he' is successfully summoned, then our victory is assured. I
        want to share this happiness with everyone."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This sort of unconcealed haughty confidence shows what can be said to be
        Tōsaka Tokiomi's hereditary characteristic. Regarding his oversized ego,
        Kirei feels somewhat in awe, yet somewhat in admiration too.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, Kirei noticed the pendulum's jewel. The jewel's movement on
        the Rollin paper did not cease, it was continuously writing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"There seems to be more to come."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yeah, ah, this is the investigation regarding another matter. This
        isn't the latest information - it's probably regarding my request for
        him to investigate Einsbern's Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Information on the Einsbern family who's cut off all contact with the
        outside world is difficult to obtain even in London's Clock Tower, but
        Tokiomi has already mentioned before that there was a lead on that
        Master. Tokiomi rolled up the paper beside him and put it atop the
        writing table, then picked up the Rollin paper containing new text.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...This was something that happened nine years ago. The Einsberns who
        have been proud of their bloodline's purity suddenly found a magus from
        the outside to be their son-in-law. This has even instigated much debate
        within the Association at the time, but the only one able to see the
        truth of this matter, other than me, would be the old head of the Matō
        household.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The magi of the Einsbern family who only excel in alchemy were not
        suited to combat since the start. This was also the contributing factor
        to their losses in the previous Heaven's Feel rituals. These people seem
        to have finally lost their patience.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This magus they found seems to really 'fit the requirements.'"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After browsing through the paper quickly while talking, Tokiomi passed
        the paper to Kirei. After seeing "Investigation report: Emiya Kiritsugu"
        as the title, Kirei's eyes narrowed slightly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This name... I've heard it somewhere before. Supposedly, this is a
        dangerous person."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oh, does the Holy Church also know of this? The 'Magus Killer' Emiya
        was really notorious at the time. Not belonging to the Association in
        appearance, but in fact was the Association's higher ups' killing tool."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So in the words of the church, he would be a sort of Executor, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Even worse than that in nature. He is a freelancing assassin who
        underwent special training to kill magi. Because only magi are most
        comprehensive of other magi, he will use methods most incompatible with
        the rules of magi to kill other magi... he is the sort of man who will
        utilize despicable measures nonchalantly."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was obvious hatred in Tokiomi's voice, yet Kirei began to bear
        interest for this man called Emiya Kiritsugu. He did hear rumors about
        this man; it seems he has opposed the Holy Church in the past, and there
        have been people who told Kirei to be very careful of this man.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei began reading the information passed on to him. Most of what was
        recorded was an investigation regarding Emiya Kiritsugu's battle
        strategy - the cases of missing persons and accidents believed to be
        magi he killed; but mainly, it was an analysis of his methodology. While
        reading, Kirei began to gradually understand why Tokiomi hates this man.
        Ambush and assassination was only the tip of the iceberg.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Planting a bomb in public, striking down an airplane with many
        passengers on board; these were the type of unbelievable cases reported.
        It is also extrapolated that the tragedies of the past reported as major
        acts of terrorism were in fact the criminal acts of Emiya Kiritsugu for
        the sake of killing one magus. Although there is no convictive evidence,
        looking at the information given, it is a very believable story.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Assassin; that word is very befitting. Magi opposing each other to the
        point of killing each other, these scenarios are common. However, it is
        purely a competition of magecraft and usually decided through a series
        of processes that abide certain combat regulations. Saying it like that,
        the Heaven's Feel also belongs in this category; although called a
        'war,' it is not a chaotic death match, but rather a series of strict
        rules and regulations exist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There isn't even a single line of text recording Kiritsugu having
        undergone a battle like this, using the 'regulations of magi'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The thing called magus exists outside of human law to begin with, and
        that's all the more reason to strictly obey the rules of our own world."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi said so, his calm voice seething with anger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But this man Emiya completely ignores all rules. He does not have a bit
        of pride as a magus. This kind of man is unforgivable."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What you said was... pride?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes. Even this man surely underwent strict training as a magus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If that's the case, then he certainly has the faith to overcome and
        surmount difficulties. It is impossible to forget his original intent
        and desire, even after attaining success."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What Tokiomi said is wrong. Submitting oneself to brutal training even
        without any intent whatsoever, this kind of idiot exists in this world.
        Regarding this, Kirei understands better than anyone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "&mdash; So why did this Emiya Kiritsugu become a killing tool?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That... it's probably because of money. After going into the Einsbern
        family, he's washed himself clean. He's already obtained enough money as
        to not worry about it for the rest of his life, so that is only
        reasonable - it should be written on that report, that guy did more than
        just assassinations. He seems to have done other stuff around the world
        any chance he gets for some extra money."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It's just as Tokiomi says, nearing the end of the report, other than
        magi related incidents, there are lots of other experiences of Emiya
        Kiritsugu. So that's how it is, Kiritsugu can be placed in most of the
        conflicts going on around the world; he's not only a killing tool, but
        also did a lot of work as a mercenary.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...This document, can I borrow it to read in detail?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ah, sure. If you can analyze it in detail for me, then it would be a
        huge help. I'm still busy preparing for the summoning ritual tonight."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">

        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei left the workshop in the basement and returned to the ground
        floor. In the hallway, he ran into a young girl battling with oversized
        luggage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Good afternoon, Rin."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not wanting to especially entertain her, but merely greeting her
        normally. The girl stopped in her tracks and stared at Kirei with wide
        eyes. He has been in contact with Rin in this house for three years, yet
        the suspicion in the girl's eyes while regarding Kirei has not
        diminished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...Good afternoon. Kirei."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a hardened voice, but still with the proper attitude, Rin returned
        Kirei's greeting. Although young, Rin already acts similar to her
        mother, her actions refined and ladylike. She's not just anyone, but
        rather Tōsaka Tokiomi's daughter. Being different from other students
        her age was perfectly natural.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Going out? That luggage is huge."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes. Starting today, we will go to grandpa's house for a bit. I'm even
        taking the cable car from that side to go to school."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the Heaven's Feel was imminent, Tokiomi decided to let his
        family temporarily live in the neighboring district--his mother-in-law's
        house.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mother and daughter cannot be exposed to the battlefield, that is
        too dangerous. Of course these are reasonable arrangements.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But his daughter Rin seems to be very unsatisfied about this. Although
        her features are fine, her cute little mouth is puffed up, showing that
        she's unhappy. Although she's to be a future lady, no matter what, she's
        still just a kid. She can't be expected to totally act to that point.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Kirei, you're staying with father to help him fight, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes, as his apprentice, this is what I should be doing."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rin is not a clueless child. As the Tōsaka magi's successor, she has
        already received Tokiomi's expert teaching. Regarding the imminent
        Fuyuki Heaven's Feel, she is equipped with some degree of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As to why she has to go to her grandpa's house, she can understand the
        legitimate reason. But, what she's unsatisfied about is--after she's
        gone, Kirei's the only one left in the Tōsaka house and could do
        whatever he wants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rin has extraordinary respect for her father Tokiomi. Precisely for this
        reason, as the successor, Rin's dislike for Kirei is probably because he
        became Tokiomi's student first, learning magecraft from him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Kirei, can I trust you? Will you protect father to the end? Will you
        promise me that?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That is impossible. If this war was benign enough for me to promise you
        that, then there would be no reason for you and your mother to get out
        of harm's way, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei is unwilling to speak empty words to comfort her, and thus plainly
        spoke the truth. But Rin's eyes became fiercer, glaring at her impudent
        and shameless apprentice elder.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...As I thought, I don't like you one bit."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only when speaking upsetting words befitting her age, that's when Kirei
        has a favorable impression of this girl.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Rin, don't ever speak such impolite words in front of others again.
        Otherwise, you will put the moral character of your father in suspect."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This has nothing to do with father!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing as even father has been pulled out as a shield; Rin's anger
        caused her face to turn a profuse red. This is exactly what Kirei hoped
        to see.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Listen up Kirei! If father is hurt because of your errors, I will
        definitely not forgive you! I &mdash;"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that moment, with what can be said to be the best possible timing,
        Aoi's shadow appeared. Already done with her preparations, but because
        Rin didn't come, she came to check out the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Rin! What are you doing? With such a loud voice!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"&mdash; Ah, that is, I &mdash;"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Before her departure, she came to give me encouragement, lady."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei pretended to be calm and purposely helped Rin, but Rin became even
        angrier. But she can't say anything in front of her mother, so she
        turned to leave.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'll help you with the luggage. Rin, that case is way too heavy for
        you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"No! I can do it myself!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rin pulled at the box even more vigorously than before, and because of
        this mired into an even fiercer battle with the case, but despite
        everything, finally got it out the door. Kirei knows that acting this
        way would be very unlike a mature adult, but he still wanted to laugh at
        Rin whenever he had the chance to.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aoi, who remained, gave Kirei a very respectful bow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Kotomine-san, I'll leave my husband in your hands. Please help him
        realize his wish."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I will do my best, please don't worry."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The way Kirei sees it, Tōsaka Aoi is the perfect wife. Solemn and
        discreet, meticulous, understanding of her husband and never
        interfering, regarding loyalty as higher than love and has respect for
        duty - in short, she's the model of the perfect wife and mother from
        older times. In an era where the feminist movement has begun to soak
        through society, she's like a character carved from stone. Tokiomi has
        really picked a person most compatible with himself as his spouse.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei stood at the door to see the mother and daughter off with his
        eyes, leaving not with a taxi, but a private car with Aoi at the
        steering wheel. Not only the chauffeur, but even all the servants,
        starting last week, have all been laid off. It is done to prevent from
        bringing harm to the innocent, and also as a kind of careful tactic
        against espionage. Tokiomi wasn't cautious enough to keep up his guard
        even against his servants; this suggestion was Kirei's, and Tokiomi was
        half forced to carry out this act.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the car left, Rin was shielded from her mother's eyes and stuck
        out her tongue at Kirei, making a face. Kirei laughed bitterly and saw
        them off with his eyes, then returned to the now empty mansion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre5">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi has not yet left the basement workshop. Kirei, being the sole
        occupant of the otherwise empty living room, began to thoroughly read
        through the report regarding Emiya Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He didn't understand why he had such intense interest in this strange
        magus he didn't even know. Perhaps it's because he derives some sort of
        feeling of pleasure from the loathing placed onto this man by his
        teacher Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The relationship of teacher and student maintained for three years in
        this house has always had a sense of satire about it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As a teacher, Tokiomi cannot nitpick on Kirei's concentration in
        learning and speedy comprehension; originally a holy servant who detests
        magecraft, yet he has immense interest in all thaumaturgical fields.
        Kirei's use of what can be called 'a greedy desire for knowledge' to
        learn everything makes Tokiomi happy. Now Tokiomi's trust for Kirei is
        completely unshakable, even to the point of making his only daughter Rin
        show respect for Kirei as an elder apprentice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But compared to Tokiomi's increasingly profound friendship, Kirei's
        heart became more and more desolate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Kirei, he's not studying magecraft because he likes it. Leading a
        long, pious life in the church, yet ending up with nothing in return;
        because of that, Kirei bet all his hopes on the new study which has
        exact opposite values to that of the church, that is all. But the result
        was a complete disaster. In the world of pursuing magecraft, Kirei did
        not find any enjoyment, nor did he gain any satiety. Quite the opposite,
        it seems to have lengthened the radius of the empty hole in his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi doesn't seem to have noticed Kirei's disappointment at all. The
        assessment of 'the same type of person as my father Risei' is completely
        correct. Tokiomi's appraisal of and trust for Kirei is exactly the same
        as Risei's.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        There's always an uncrossable line between himself and people like his
        father and Tokiomi. Kirei understood this completely, and so that's
        probably why he has such interest for a character Tokiomi detests.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He thought, maybe this man Emiya Kiritsugu exists on 'the other side of
        the line.'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi's caution against Emiya Kiritsugu seems to be purely against his
        title of 'Magus Killer', so this investigation report created at the
        request of Tokiomi focused on 'his personal history of battles against
        magi', any other record not on this topic was rather simplistic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But, looking at this man Kiritsugu's experiences in chronological order,
        Kirei began to gradually gain a belief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This man's actions contain a high level of risk.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the era of freelancing assassination before he was taken in by the
        Einsberns as their son-in-law, Kiritsugu expertly completed countless
        missions. But the pause between missions was clearly too short.
        Considering the time he has for preparation and accepting missions, the
        only possible conclusion is that he is simultaneously executing several
        plans. And these plans are all parallel; he appears in the conflicts of
        various areas, and always when the conflict is the most heated, at the
        point of destruction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if he was suicidal, as if he had some sort of sickness driving him...
        the principle behind his actions is clearly self-destruction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This can be said without question. This man Kiritsugu does not have a
        selfish heart, the risks of his actions and profiting from them do not
        match. It's impossible that he's the kind of freelancing assassin with
        money as the intent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Then &mdash; what does he seek?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unconsciously, Kirei put the report aside, propped his lower jaw on his
        hand, and sunk into deep thought. This man Emiya Kiritsugu has a
        turbulent life inconceivable by others, but Kirei doesn't see it as
        unrelated to himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A magus without pride, a man who lost his belief, Tokiomi assessed him
        as thus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If that's the truth, Kiritsugu's intense experiences, as if seeking
        destruction... or can it be said as a journey of seeking a long lost
        answer?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, the curtain on Kiritsugu's continuous battles fell suddenly nine
        years ago. That's because through continuous searching, he met with the
        Einsbern magi seeking victory in the Heaven's Feel in the northern
        lands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That is to say, at that moment, he obtained his 'answer.'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, Kirei anxiously anticipates his meeting with Emiya Kiritsugu.
        He has finally found the significance of his participation in the Fuyuki
        battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even now, he has no interest in the Grail. But, if Kiritsugu broke a
        nine-year silence for it, Kirei has just gained the significance of
        coming here to participate in this fight which can dispel all
        difficulties.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He must ask this man. 'What is it that you are seeking that you would
        participate in this battle... what do you obtain from it in the end?'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kotomine Kirei will confront Emiya Kiritsugu no matter what. Even if
        it's on a battlefield where both sides wager life and death.
