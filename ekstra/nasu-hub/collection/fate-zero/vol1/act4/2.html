      <p class="calibre3">
        A golden light immediately arrived following Rider's bellow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The light was still faltering out, and there already was no surprise
        left in the heart of the spectators. It wasn't just a wild guess anymore
        that this was a fourth Servant who had made an appearance responding to
        Rider's provocation. The dreadful point is that the beginning of the
        hostilities was a gathering of four Servants already. Nobody could
        possibly conjecture what the turn of events would be.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As expected, the golden light came from 10 meters above, atop a street
        pole, where a figure standing in a shining armor could be seen. Waver
        held his breath at the sight of such dazzling dignity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This guy is..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had seen him for only one instant the previous time, but there was no
        mistaking such an intense existence. The one standing calmly atop the
        street light was none other than the enigmatic Servant who had sent into
        oblivion with an overwhelming destructive power the Assassin who was
        invading the Tōsaka mansion the previous night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This couldn't be Caster, his entire body covered in armor. If he had
        materialized in response to Rider's call, it meant he had the sense to
        recognize the provocation as such, thus he couldn't be Berserker.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        By elimination, the only one left was― the last of the three Knight
        classes, Archer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't expect there would be two fools in one night to have the
        insolence of calling themselves "kings" and ignore me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For his very first words, the golden Heroic Spirit looked very
        displeased, scorning from above at the three Servants with a glare. His
        arrogance and his tone were comparable to Rider's haughtiness, but it
        differed from the very root. There was never cruelty and mercilessness
        in the voice and eyes of the King of Conquerors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even Rider didn't expect anyone more domineering than himself to show
        up, as he was stroking his chin with a bewildered look void of malice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You are mistaken... I, Alexander, am the one who is well known
        throughout the world as the King of Conquerors."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Fool. The only hero in Heaven and Earth who is a real king is me. The
        rest are a collection of mongrels."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer threw him aside with a declaration that was more than an insult.
        Of course, color was already drained from Saber's face, but the tolerant
        Rider drew an amazed sigh, ignoring it altogether.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you want to say that much, could you first announce yourself? If you
        are such a king, you couldn't be ashamed of your fame?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Rider's banter, Archer's crimson eyes grew even more of a proud anger
        as he glared at the giant under him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Are you questioning me? A lowly mongrel questioning a king like me?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Frankly speaking, Rider's point was reasonable, but apparently, Archer
        took it as an incorrigible disrespect from his point of view. This
        wasn't a matter of gaining interest from concealing one's true name, but
        rather from a personal irritability, the golden Heroic Spirit was
        emitting a very clear murderous intent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I grant you the honor of my presence yet you can't recognize me; such
        ignorance isn't even worth living."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Archer's conclusion, the space around him distorted in a haze― the
        next instant, the glow of beautiful blades started coming out of the
        empty space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There are bare blades as well as spears. Each of them is decorated with
        eye-catching ornaments, and emits a fierce magical power. It is clear
        they are no common weapons but Noble Phantasms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without a doubt, this is the same thing as the previous night― the
        mysterious attack that unilaterally wiped out Assassin. All of those who
        were observing the Tōsaka mansion the previous night understand that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...hh"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver was struck with awe. The unseen Master of Lancer gulped. Kiritsugu
        and Maiya as well, observing at a long distance, also felt the tension.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And now, one man― just like Rider and Waver, one Master who had been
        following Lancer's movements through the day and was now observing
        hidden in the storehouses; as that man was spying on the battlefield
        through the vision of a familiar, he stared at Archer's strange battle
        preparation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yes, it was undoubtedly the same. Archer was definitely the golden
        Servant who had defended the Tōsaka mansion from Assassin's invasion the
        previous night, in other words, this was Tōsaka Tokiomi's Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Haha, hahahaha..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the darkness, an old hatred burning in his one bloodshot eye, Matō
        Kariya let a laugh escape.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now was the time he had anxiously waited for. He had endured a year of
        living hell looking forward to that instant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tōsaka Tokiomi...</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Husband of Aoi, father of Sakura, yet the man who had trampled over the
        happiness of the mother and child.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The hated, cursed sworn enemy who took everything Kariya wished for, who
        degraded it all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now, the old resentment is cleared away. This was the time to face that
        man, changing into a sword the hatred boiling in his heart――
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Kill him..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was an unimaginable pleasure in filling his voice with hate. Now,
        Kariya understood the meaning of the saying "revenge is a dish best
        served cold."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi himself can wait. His Servant must first be demolished, to make
        him lose the Holy Grail War. He was in a maddening excitement just
        thinking of Tokiomi's face smeared in the frustrating humiliation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Kill him, Berserker!! Pulverize that Archer!!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        At that time, somewhere else, an unexpected torrent of prana swept in a
        roar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As everyone was watching, the flowing prana gathered and solidified,
        materializing into the shadow of a robust man.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That shadow stood up near the four lane road that had become the
        battlefield of Saber and Lancer, two blocks further toward the sea.
        Truly, that was a fantastic apparition that could be described as
        nothing other than a "shadow".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the width of the tall figure's shoulders, this was the body of a
        man, completely covered in a full armor without any opening. But it was
        different from the silver armor wrapping Saber or the luxurious golden
        one of Archer. This man's armor was black. Without any delicate
        ornament, with no polished luster. Like darkness, like Hell, it was just
        a bottomless black. The face was also invisible, covered with a rustic
        helmet. In the depth of a thinly carved slit, there was the ghastly glow
        of a pair of eyes with a glare burning like a flame.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A Servant. That was plain. Yet, just what Heroic Spirit was this
        sinister appearance?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This black knight definitely didn't have any of the "radiance" that bore
        the other Servants who were already there. Arturia, Diarmuid, and the
        King of Conquerors Alexander as well as the yet unannounced golden
        Archer all have that "shine". This is the expression of the pride of a
        Heroic Spirit. The honor of the legends everyone praises and longs for.
        This is an essential element of their "noble phantasm".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But the newly appeared black knight had none of it. You could say he was
        closer to an Assassin. The darkness around the black armor definitely
        held a "negative surge".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, more than a Heroic Spirit, he might be labelled a vengeful spirit
        instead...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Hey, King of Conquerors. Did you invite that guy too?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Still observing the black knight carefully, yet with a light tone,
        Lancer railed at Rider. Taking the hit, Rider grimaced.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Invited, eh? That one doesn't look like he'll take any negotiation,
        ugh."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nothing but blood thirst flowed from the black knight. Even the
        whirlwind of prana seemed ominous as a groan full of deep hatred.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Berserker... Everyone could see that without waiting for a confirmation.
        Such a fiendish surge of murderous intent could only come from the class
        of the Heroic Spirit of fury.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"So, kid. What kind of Servant is he, that guy?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider asked Waver, but the small Master shook his head, dumbfounded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... I don't know. I simply can't tell."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Whaat? You're a Master, aren't you? His strong and weak points should
        be visible to you, eh?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As a Master who has made a contract with a Servant, it is possible to
        read out the status of a Servant with powers of clairvoyance. This is a
        unique ability granted by the Grail that has summoned the Heroic
        Spirits. This doesn't work for the fake Master that is Irisviel, but
        Waver, rightful Master of Rider, is capable of seeing through the
        abilities of the other Servants and compare them to those of Rider, to
        guide him as efficiently as possible in battle situations. In fact,
        Waver already had a clear understanding of the faculties of Saber,
        Lancer and Archer. But&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I said I can't see it! That black guy is definitely a Servant... But I
        just can't read out his stats!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider frowned in suspicion at Waver's confused explanation, and took a
        new look at the black knight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The armor with the color of darkness shows no characteristic feature,
        and tells no clue on the lineage of the maker. &mdash;No, it isn't just
        that there are no details to see; it is all blurred.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It wasn't just Rider. Saber, Lancer and Irisviel had also noticed the
        same thing. No matter how carefully one would watch, he just wouldn't
        accurately perceive Berserker's figure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just like an off-focus photograph, the outlines of the black armor was
        always shifting, like a mist, and you would sometime see it double or
        triple. Somehow, the material seemed to be made out of a hallucination.
        It isn't just the vision that was affected; it also matches the
        clairvoyance of the Masters. That would be some sort of unique curse
        that fakes the person's true identity. It couldn't be a skill proper to
        the Berserker class.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Looks like another troublesome enemy we have..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Saber nodded at Irisvie’sl murmur.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's not all. With now four opponents, we can't do any careless
        movement."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a regular battle royal, the most reliable tactic is to smash those in
        numerical inferiority with a concentrated effort. Thus, if they show one
        weakness here and now, they might be forced into the worse outcome, a
        four to one hopeless battle. In this case, even Saber doesn't stand a
        chance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Who will start attacking who, and who will take that chance to make his
        move&mdash; To survive in this place, one needs to accurately see
        through everyone else's movements. This is true for all Heroic Spirits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Presently, Rider isn't targeting anyone in particular. His current
        purpose is probably to have a look at the Heroic Spirits participating
        in the Holy Grail War. But as one who knows no fear, he is the kind of
        man who stands up at anyone's challenge.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer clearly sees Rider and Saber as his enemies. The golden Heroic
        Spirit seems to take ill humor in the two who call themselves "King of
        Conquerors" and "King of Knights". His preferred target is likely the
        one who provoked him, Rider.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">There is one problematic person left.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Berserker. Nobody could figure out what was the intention of the black
        knight in materializing here and now. It added to the mayhem in which
        nobody could take control of the situation. No prudent Master would
        think of pitting his Servant in the middle of this chaos.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No doubt anyone would be equally wary of Berserker, yet there was one
        exception. There was no doubt or hesitation in Archer's crimson eyes,
        only an absolute anger and murderous intent he was holding in while
        looking down at Berserker.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The disgusting stare of the black knight was turned only at him standing
        on top of the street pole; the golden Heroic Spirit could undoubtedly
        see that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You mad dog, do you expect pity from me?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A lowlife's gaze is equally lowly and filthy. Being poured by this gaze
        is an intolerable disgrace for a nobleman. To Archer, who claims the
        title of king even more than Rider, Berserker's ill manners made him a
        complete criminal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The treasure swords and spears all around him changed direction. Their
        tip was now fully aiming at the new target; that is, Berserker.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You shall at least entertain me when you scatter away, mongrel."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A sword and a spear bustle in the air at the heartless verdict.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The weapons coming out of nowhere shot without warning&mdash; this must
        be the reason the golden Heroic Spirit is an archer. But this off-hand
        Noble Phantasm was too abnormal. The Noble Phantasm, which should be a
        treasure to the Heroic Spirit, was being pitched carelessly like you’d
        casually throw a handful of stones.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Still, the destructive power was enormous. The road surface was blown up
        like it was hit with an explosive blast, and the scene was shrouded by
        the dust of the asphalt pulverized into particles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Kh!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone gulped equally.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the thick dust, the shadow of a dark, tall figure wavered into their
        visibility.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Berserker stood unharmed. He had merely moved from his starting point,
        where the road had become a crater. Out of the weapons thrown by Archer,
        the spear is the cause of this, hitting its target after being delayed a
        little. And the sword that should have reached its target a little
        before the spear had brought no destruction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The reason for that would be that the sword was in Berserker's hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        How many had seen the swift offense and defense? At least Irisviel and
        Waver couldn't understand what had just happened. Truthfully&mdash;
        Berserker had grabbed the precious sword effortlessly, the first strike
        thrown by Archer, and with his newly acquired weapon he had deflected
        the second strike, the precious spear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... That bastard, is he really a Berserker?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider responded with a howling voice to Lancer's strained murmur.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "For someone who has forsaken his reason for madness, he's a remarkably
        skilled chap."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A Noble Phantasm is a weapon for the exclusive usage of the Heroic
        Spirit who owns it. Another Heroic Spirit who gets a hold of it won't be
        able to handle it correctly. Be it by miracle or skill, it should be
        properly impossible to repel a consecutive strike so clearly in a flash.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And yet, more than surprise, it was apparently rage that came to Archer.
        All kind of facial expression distorted his elegant face, frozen in a
        murderous frenzy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "&mdash; How dare you touch my treasure with your filthy hand... Do you
        want to die that badly, you cur!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The air around Archer starts dancing again. Like a halo, a golden
        majesty twirls in circles to show a flock of new Noble Phantasms&mdash;
        now sixteen of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not just spears and swords. There are axes. Hammers and halberds. Even
        items with indefinite usage or origin, bladed weaponry with a strange
        shape.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Every single one of them is polished like a mirror, and still has an
        enormous amount of prana flowing from them. Not one of them is below the
        level of a divine mystery... All of them, no exception, are indeed Noble
        Phantasms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That's, not possible..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was Waver thinking out loud. But the other Masters and Heroic
        Spirits probably thought likewise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A Heroic Spirit doesn't need to stop at one Noble Phantasm. Sometime,
        someone can treasure three, four super weapons that qualify as such. But
        nobody could have that many.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And here&mdash; Archer is throwing them one after the other like he has
        an inexhaustible supply of them. And not one of them was even already
        seen in the battle against Assassin the previous night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Let's see&mdash; just to what point this little compulsive thief can
        keep up!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Archer's command, the flock of Noble Phantasms floating in the air
        were left loose, rushing toward Berserker.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A thunderous roar shook the night air, a flash of light exploding
        through the sky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Who would believe that such destruction could be done by throwing swords
        and other similar weapons? A countless number of Noble Phantasms rained
        down on the road of the warehouse town, which already looked like it had
        received carpet bombing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And still, Archer's fierce attack didn't stop. The Noble Phantasms fell
        like thunderbolts, shot at Berserker's standing place with enough force
        to scatter anything away, and kept striking and striking and striking
        again. The attack was continuous, even increasing in violence.
        &mdash;Because the target, Berserker, just wouldn't fall down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone was shocked. Even in a critical situation with a great number
        of enemies around, everyone shared the same thoughts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was a replay of the miracle of the first attack. Berserker just
        took the first halberd that came at him with his left hand, then swung
        left and right the sword in his right hand, repelling every single one
        of the following Noble Phantasms away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Such a technique was subtle and flawless. There was grandeur in it. Even
        with a Noble Phantasm snatched from Archer, the handling wasn't poor by
        a bit. He was swinging them around freely, like extensions of his arms;
        it simply looked like a demonstration of his polished skills with the
        favourite weapons he had specialized in for years.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Both offense and defense followed their course together.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thinking about it, unlike the three other Servants, the identity of the
        golden Archer and the dark Berserker is still a mystery. Saber and
        Lancer shuddered at the threat. If they are to advance through the Holy
        Grail War, they may get to cross arms with these two. But in front of
        these beasts who are beyond reason, just how should they get ready to
        stand up?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "&mdash;The golden one seems to be proud of the number of his Noble
        Phantasms, but the black guy has the worst affinity with him."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two Servants watched silently on one side, as the other one standing
        there, Rider, spoke confidently.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "When Blacky takes a weapon, he becomes stronger by just taking it. And
        Goldy throws them so shamelessly. He's a versatile fellow."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the King of Conquerors calmly commented, Berserker wasn't taking one
        step back in front of Archer's fierce attack. On the contrary, when a
        more powerful Noble Phantasm flew at him, he would abandon his current
        one to exchange it scrupulously with the new weapon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The violent roaring sound stopped when the last of the sixteen Noble
        Phantasms fell down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the hollow silence, there was only Berserker in the middle of the
        dust coming down. The surroundings, including the storehouses and street
        lights, were all completely ruined. The black knight had a battle ax in
        his right hand and a simple sword in his left. All the other Noble
        Phantasms were scattered at Berserker's feet, or stuck in the rubbles
        around. Not a single blade had reached the black armor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Berserker nonchalantly raised the two remaining Noble Phantasms in his
        hands&mdash; and without preparation, he threw them in Archer's
        direction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maybe the aiming was off, or he didn't really try to hit anything, but
        the ax and the blade hit the pole of the street light that Archer was
        standing on top of. The blade hit the middle, and the ax, the top,
        cutting the pole into pieces as if it was butter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The pole cut in three pieces fell in a tremor. But that's the only thing
        that fell clumsily on the ground. The golden Heroic Spirit had jumped
        before the iron pole was cut into pieces, and landed on the ground
        apparently unscathed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Damn fool... Are you trying to put me on the same ground as you, me who
        should be at the top?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &mdash;No, saying he was unscathed is only from a third party's point of
        view.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer's rage had apparently reached its critical limit. The wrinkles
        carved between his eyebrows changed his good features to an evil omen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You deserve death for your insult. You mongrel, I won't leave a single
        piece of your body!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In anger, Archer howled at Berserker, his eyes burning crimson. For the
        third time, the space around him warped to let a herd of blades
        materialize...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next count of glowing Noble Phantasms reached thirty-two. This time,
        even Rider kept silent. Berserker had endured a continuous attack of
        sixteen Noble Phantasms, but there was no way to resist twice that
        number. That was the same for all the other Servants. Nobody could
        estimate the limits of the latent power of the golden Archer anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Gilgamesh is serious. He intends to open the 'Gate of Babylon' even
        more."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tōsaka Tokiomi held his head at Kotomine Kirei's comment coming from the
        jeweled communicator.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The basement of the Tōsaka mansion had none of the discomfort of the far
        away storehouse town that had become a battlefield. Kirei, manipulating
        Assassin, was bringing results. The conditions were perfect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only thing that wasn't part of the calculations was&mdash; maybe
        that the strongest Heroic Spirit, Gilgamesh, had come to the present
        time in the Archer class.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say the characteristic of the Archer
        class is the strength of its Noble Phantasms; for Gilgamesh who owned an
        extraordinary one with the rank EX, it might have been inevitable. But
        in the end, the skill of Independent Action of the self-conceited King
        of Heroes was high ranked, and that certainly was the biggest
        miscalculation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi respected the high prestige of the King of Heroes as much as he
        could, and as much as he deserved. But to think that his tolerance would
        be tested so much, so early...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gilgamesh must be the last to move. Right now, this is still Assassin's
        turn to act and gather information. Something as rash as exposing the
        Gate of Babylon again to everyone&mdash; and throwing all his strength
        against the mysterious Berserker, this just can't be overlooked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To a Servant with the skill of Independent Action, who doesn't rely on
        the Master, the only way to give him orders are the Command Seals. This
        grants the right for only three absolute orders. To make a Servant out
        of Gilgamesh who doesn't have an ounce of respect for his Master, they
        are all the more precious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Always maintain your elegance&mdash; this is a family precept handed
        down for generations for the Tōsaka family. To him who keeps it to his
        heart, to be pressed into using a Command Seal before all the other
        Masters...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Master, your decision?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei urges with a hard voice from the other end of the communicator.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Grinding his teeth, Tokiomi stared at the back of his right hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Staring at Berserker with a burning hatred, Archer slowly looked away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He faced south-east. Over there is the hill of the Miyama district and
        the high class residential area. How many people can guess it is the
        direction of the Tōsaka mansion?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Do you think a sermon from someone like you could appease a king's
        anger? You're quite presumptuous, Tokiomi..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a tone of abject annoyance, Archer spat in a suppressed voice. The
        glow of the countless Noble Phantasms around him disappeared at once,
        off to somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... You dodged death by a hair, mad dog."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was containing his resentment, but his crimson eyes had already lost
        the flame of the killing intent. With his firm haughtiness, the golden
        Archer glared at the row of Servants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You mongrels. Cut down the mob next time. I will tolerate no less than
        a real hero."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With this final careless remark, Archer cancelled his materialization.
        The golden armor lost its materiality and disappeared, leaving only the
        remains of its glow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The confrontation between the two knights, golden and dark, reached its
        conclusion in a way no one expected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmf. Apparently this guy's Master has even more of a hardy character
        than Archer himself."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Amazed, Rider exaggerated with a bitter smile. But everyone else figured
        it wasn't the time for a careless remark. The Berserker who was evenly
        balanced with Archer was still standing in front of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The eyes glowing widely in the slit of the helmet first wandered in the
        empty space, having lost their target... Then, finding a new spoil, they
        flamed up again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Stared at by those eyes dyed the color of malice, Saber felt a chill
        bustling through her spine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Ur..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The voice seemed to boil from the ground. Like a spell, like a curse, it
        was a moan full of malice that hardly resembled human speech.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was the voice of Berserker, the first time the others heard it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Ar... Ur... h!!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like a curse with a human shape, swelling from the murderous intent, the
        black knight charged at the silver King of Knights.
