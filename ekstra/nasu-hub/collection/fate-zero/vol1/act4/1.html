      <p class="calibre3">"...Damn it. This is bad."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider, who was standing on the arch of the Fuyuki Bridge overlooking the
        battle taking place in the warehouse district, muttered softly as he
        stood up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Wha, what is?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing the giant Servant display impatience for the first time, Waver
        became agitated, and he questioned Rider while clinging to the steel
        frame.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Lancer brought out a decisive technique. Looks like he wants the match
        decided quickly."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Wouldn't that be favorable for us?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Fool, what are you talking about?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider stamped his heel on the steel frame he was standing on with a
        bang. For Waver, whose entire body was clinging to the frame, the tremor
        shook him to his very bones, and another shriek rose.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I wanted to wait out on the battle's development before everyone
        arrives, but by the look of the current situation Saber's going to have
        a disadvantage, and it would be too late to attack by then."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Too late? &ndash; Didn't you want to strike when they have all become
        exhausted from fighting each other?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...I think you have misunderstood something, boy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider furrowed his brows and tilted his head downwards to look at the
        Master lying beside his feet, as if disappointed at the performance of a
        humorless clown.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I did hope that other Servants would take up Lancer's bait. Isn't it
        obvious? Rather than picking them out one by one, it's far better to get
        them all together and have a great battle royale!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver forgot to answer; he was shocked out of his wits in realising the
        differences between his understanding and that of the brave Heroic
        Spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Get them all together... a great battle royale?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes. It's such a rare opportunity to cross blades with the greatest
        heroes across all ages. If all six of them are here in completion, I
        won't let any one of them get away."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A fierce and dangerous growl as that of a lion seeped out of Rider's
        throat, but there was a tint of laughter as he tilted the ends of his
        lips upwards. Waver realized that only this man could wear a grin like
        that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Now then, Saber and Lancer. They both have the flaming spirit of true
        warriors. I admire them; it would be a pity to let them die like this."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What else is there apart from killing them?! Isn't that the point of
        the Holy Grail Waaa-!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver's slightly hysterical voice was mercilessly interrupted by a smack
        to his forehead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Victory without ruin, domination without disgrace. That is true
        conquest!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider proclaimed, holding his chest upright; then he unsheathed the
        sword by his waist and sliced through the hollow sky with a swing,
        cleaving apart the empty space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An enormous shining Noble Phantasm immediately appeared, accompanied by
        spiralling torrents of galloping prana. Waver felt like he was about to
        be blown over by the sudden storm, swallowing his screams and hugging
        the steel frame even tighter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Observation is over. We will join the battle, boy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before his words were finished, Rider had mounted the Noble Phantasm
        with a leap, his mantle flowing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Idiot idiot idiot! You're acting nonsense!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oh? If you don't want to go, you can stay here and look."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I am going! Bring me along, idiot!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Good, that's more like my Master!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider emitted clear laughter, took hold Waver's collar gently, and let
        Waver ride beside himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Now roll on, Gordius Wheel • Wheel of Heaven's Authority!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Noble Phantasm answered the call of the King of Conquerors with a
        thunderous tremor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre5">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Gales surged. A confusion of life and death.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment that the swordsman and the spearman slid past each other,
        flowers of bright crimson blood fluttered and bloomed briefly &ndash;
        before fading away in the blink of an eye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber, who charged past, stopped. The two of them turned at the same
        time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They both still stood erect, without losing the thought of warring
        against each other. The two Heroic Spirits were still intact.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finally the battle had the slight possibility of moving away from the
        path of attacking each other. At that moment Saber took in the situation
        and made a quick decision that prolonged their duel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As a result, the yellow short spear that poised to pierce Saber did not
        land on Saber's chest, but her left arm. At the same time the golden
        sword that Saber uplifted deviated just a little from Lancer's vitals,
        the edge aimed at Lancer's left arm... Curious how they were injured at
        the same place.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">But were they damaged to the same extent?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You still won't let me win easily... It's very good, that adamant
        manner of yours."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer stared at Saber with a desolate smile, as if desperately trying
        not to pay attention to the wound on his elbow. As expected, like a film
        on rewind, Lancer's injury was healed without anyone touching it and
        left no trace behind. A Servant's self-healing would not manage to
        recover him that quickly; it must be his hidden and observing Master who
        used the healing magecraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Contrary to Lancer, even Saber's demure beauty could not hide her pain
        and anxiety.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer's airborne spear and the sword clutched tightly by Saber's two
        hands had a definite imbalance in power. At least, from the outside, the
        wound dealt by the short spear on Saber's forearm seemed rather light
        compared to Lancer's injury.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...Irisviel, heal my wound as well."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I healed it! I did, but..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to Saber, who was injured, Irisviel's expression appeared even
        more flustered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel was undoubtedly a first-rate magus. The strength and intensity
        of her craft goes without saying. She is, in truth, an exception in the
        world of magi, possessing a body that was ‘designed' and ‘manufactured'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It would be impossible for her to make mistakes when using basic
        magecraft such as healing. Even if an error did occur on the off chance,
        Irisviel would know how to deal with it herself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">And yet &ndash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No, the healing did work. Saber, your current state is one of full
        health."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber did not dare to keep her guard down as she kept appraising Lancer
        with caution, and at the same time stared at the injury on her left arm.
        The wound did not bleed much and was quite shallow, but the problem was
        that her sinews were severed. The most important digit on her hand, the
        thumb, can not be moved; therefore Saber can not exert enough strength
        to grip the sword hilt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber knew that there is nothing wrong with Irisviel's healing methods,
        but the arm was not cured. Her left thumb felt as if it was born
        crippled, turning completely immobile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer paid no attention to Saber, nor did he resume his attack. Full of
        confidence, he bent down and retrieved with his left hand the yellow
        short spear that fell to the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In front of my Noble Phantasm Gáe Dearg • Crimson Rose of Exorcism,
        it's good that you realized armor is useless."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps he thought that after showing the effects of his Noble Phantasm,
        there was no point in keeping up the masquerade. Lancer spoke the true
        name of his Noble Phantasm with no hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But you were rash to discard your armor. If you had not, you would have
        a defence against Gáe Buidhe • Golden Rose of Mortality."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer, the long red spear in his right hand, the short yellow spear in
        his left, began to swing them exaggeratedly as though spreading a pair
        of wings, in exactly the same manner as when the battle first began. It
        was not a gesture to seduce, but a unique battle style mastered after
        arduous training.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I understand now... It is a cursed spear; wounds dealt by it would
        never heal. I should've noticed this earlier..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A crimson spear that severs prana, a cursed golden spear, and a love
        spot below his left eye that attracts women &ndash; it was easy to
        determine once all those are put together. Based on legends, the
        glorious name praised by the Celtic legends of heroes was actually
        remotely related to King Arthur. It was quite incredulous that this did
        not occur to Saber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The first warrior of the Knights of Fianna... Diarmuid of the Love
        Spot. I did not know that the Grail granted the honor of participating
        in the war to you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's the beauty of this war for the Holy Grail... But the honor is
        mine. For one that traverses time and space to join the Throne of Heroes
        due to its invitation would not mistake your golden sword for any
        other."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Servant participating in the fourth Holy Grail War, Lancer... the
        Heroic Spirit of the Celts, Diarmuid ua Duibhne.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer, whose cover was carelessly blown off, narrowed his eyes with a
        refreshed feeling despite that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Competing with the famous King of Knights to avenge your sword blow
        &ndash; Hmph, I wouldn't give this opportunity up either."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Heroic Spirits who are separated by time they had no historical
        connections. Through the legends of the past from the era that invited
        them forth, they managed to know the heroes that came after them.
        Diarmuid also knew of the legend of King Arthur that brought fame to his
        homeland after his time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, since we know each other's name, I challenge you as a knight to
        determine the victor of this mundane battle &ndash; although I've
        already wounded your arm. Are you feeling that it's unfair, Saber?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't kid me. It would be more of a shame to me if you worry about such
        a small injury of mine."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber declared resolutely, while at the same time gritted her teeth with
        hatred deep in her heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Just one blow is not a big deal...</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber gathered her prana once again to wrap herself in silver armour.
        Although it would be a waste of prana before Lancer's Gáe Dearg, it
        could still block the critical blow from Gáe Buidhe. Saber compressed
        the surrounding air and once more sealed her golden sword inside
        Invisible Air • Boundary of the Wind King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Her wound cannot be healed. Most likely, the curse of the golden spear
        will not be dispelled until the spear itself is destroyed, or its owner
        Diarmuid has fallen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber must break through Lancer's twin spears with her remaining right
        hand. With the aid of prana bursts, single-handedly wielding her sword
        would not be too painful. But the strength that could only be delivered
        with both hands was sealed, and she can not use her ultimate attack:
        Excalibur • Sword of Promised Victory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However &ndash; At this moment, far from cowering down, Saber's fighting
        spirit soared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a meticulous plan to use one of his two Noble Phantasms first,
        and cunningly lure his enemy into carelessness. Saber was not angry with
        the trick; rather, she eagerly wanted to applaud Lancer's scheme.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This enemy is perfect.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She encountered such a flawless enemy for the first battle of the Holy
        Grail War. As a warrior who lived by the sword, it was inevitable that
        her fighting spirit ascend to the skies when faced with a fabulous
        opponent. At the same time Diarmuid ua Duibhne, the one that stood
        opposing Saber, was also forcing himself to face her not only with
        tricks, but spending all of his wits on this ultimate battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer would have detected Saber's vigor without words. A satisfied grin
        seeped up Lancer's mouth. His heart felt the exact same way as Saber's
        did. Lancer respected Saber for sacrificing her left arm to block the
        surprise attack of his Gáe Buidhe that was unleashed for the kill. It
        added an extra sheen to the joy Lancer associated with the worth of
        winning this battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As knights, the two Heroic Spirits even echoed each other on their
        souls' desire to do battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Prepare yourself, Saber, I will win this time."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Only if I do not win first, Lancer."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two exchanged their bold provocations as both planned their next,
        fatal attack, slowly and cautiously approaching the other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The holy sword and demonic spear were at the edge of an explosive
        situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The air that was cold and clear and full of tension &ndash; at that
        moment, it was suddenly cloven apart by a thunderous ruckus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">" &ndash;&nbsp;!?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber and Lancer were both stilled with awe, simultaneously turning to
        look at the south-eastern sky. The source of the sound was clear for all
        eyes to see.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A flying object drew a straight line across the sky and was heading
        directly to their location, shedding violet sparks of lightning on its
        way. The sound was undoubtedly created by it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Irisviel was dumbstruck as she said in shock.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">‘...A chariot...?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From its appearance, it was an antique chariot with two prows. War
        horses were not yoked on the shaft, but handsome bulls with muscles
        rippling like waves. Their hooves ploughed the empty space, pulling the
        luxurious and splendid chariot forward.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No, the chariot was not merely floating in air. Its wheels boomed
        loudly; it was not solid ground but lightning that the bulls stood upon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Every time the bulls' hooves and the chariot 'stomped' upon the empty
        sky, violet lightning spread like a web, rolling the air upwards with
        deafening roars. The prana spurting from the lightning was probably what
        Lancer and Saber can only unleash if they use up every single ounce of
        their strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only a Servant's Noble Phantasm can be so strange and emit such a great
        amount of prana. Without a doubt, a third Servant had decided to
        interrupt the duel between Saber and Lancer, and was therefore showing
        himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber and Lancer both tensed, and stared at the suddenly arriving
        chariot soundlessly. Irisviel's alarm was obvious, and the unseen Master
        of Lancer should have also felt a shiver of fear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To be enveloped by such an enormous aura of lightning and thunder, the
        Heroic Spirit is most likely some sort of thunder god. And if it was a
        thunder god with a connection to bulls, the first one to come into
        someone's mind would be the highest god of Mount Olympus. Although this
        chariot can not be called a Heroic Spirit itself, even as a Heroic
        Spirit's attachment it was very threatening.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The chariot that tread on lightning circled above Lancer and Saber
        menacingly, then slowed down and landed on the ground. It was positioned
        exactly between the two Heroic Spirits, blocking both the sword and the
        lance. The dazzling light that ceased as the chariot landed revealed the
        figure of a muscular man, standing commandingly at the helm of the
        chariot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Both of you, put down your arms. A king comes!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This casual bellow was almost as loud as the thunders emitted when he
        rode upon the air. The fiery glare almost held the power to reflect back
        the opposing sword blade and spear tip.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer and Saber are both famous Heroic Spirits; a yell or two is not
        going to scare them away. However, this new Heroic Spirit did not want
        to attack them, but just joined in because he wanted to intervene in
        their duel. The two of them began to hesitate since they did not
        understand the reason behind that action.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The imposing owner of the chariot first dented Lancer and Saber's vigor
        then continued to speak in a stern tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My name is Alexander, King of Conquerors. I am participating in this
        Holy Grail War and received the class of Rider."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was when everyone really became gob-smacked. In the war of the Holy
        Grail no Servant would want to declare his identity as it could be a key
        component of his battle plans. Meanwhile, the most agitated people
        around was Waver, who sat beside Rider.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What &ndash; the bloody hell do you think you're doing, stupid
        moroooooooon?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His fear of Rider's looming bulk already forgotten, Waver shrieked at
        Rider while grasping the mantle of the King of Conquerors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bish, the merciless finger flick echoed in the night; the protesting
        voice died down. Only the middle finger of Rider's right hand paid any
        attention to it, and Rider asked with a glance to Lancer and Saber that
        were on either sides of him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You slaughter each other to obtain the Grail... I want to ask you
        something before you engage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I don't know what expectations you have of the Grail. But now, consider
        for moment whether your wishes are even greater than the desire to
        possess all of earth and heaven."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Saber still hadn't understood what he meant, her instincts told
        her that those words were full of danger. Her pupils widened
        subconsciously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You &ndash; what do you want to say?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hum? I was quite clear."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        By then Rider had maintained his dignity, but his voice was much more
        gentle and amicable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I have descended upon the battlefield, so do you have any intention to
        pass the Holy Grail to me? If you forfeit your claims to the Grail, I
        would regard you as friends, and share with you the joy of conquering
        the world."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was such a random suggestion. Saber was dazed before she had a chance
        to feel angry. Opposite her, Lancer was also stunned speechless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Alexander, King of Conquerors. He is indeed an extraordinary Heroic
        Spirit. There had no one else like him in human history, so full of
        eagerness to manifest his ambition of conquering the world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But even so, what about Rider's suggestion? Suddenly jumping out,
        proudly declaring his true name, demanding others to respect him before
        he had shown his worth in battle: all those actions made it look like he
        has no desire to join the war for the Holy Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was the first time that anyone had seen something like this. It was
        hard to tell whether this was a wise decision or a foolish move.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I admire your boldness in declaring your identity just then, yet... I
        found it hard to agree to your proposals."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer shook his head with a bitter smile, but there was no laughter in
        his eyes. A glare as intimidating as a sharp sword collided head-on with
        the scornful sideway glance of the King of Conquerors; sparks flew.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I will lift up the Grail; that is the oath I took with the only new
        king of this era. The one that will hold the Grail in his hands will not
        be you, Rider."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...Did you stop my duel with Lancer just to declare all those
        nonsense?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber asked, immediately following Lancer's words. Her expression was
        different from that of the beautiful spearman; there wasn't any laughter
        to be found. Rider's suggestion was extremely irritating for someone as
        serious as her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your joke was overdone, King of Conquerors. This is unbearable
        humiliation to a knight."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer and Saber both cast hostile glares towards Rider. Rider mumbled
        as if troubled, massaging his temples with his knuckles subconsciously
        at the same time. Although Rider appeared to be running out of plans,
        his majestic pose did not change at all. Therefore, Rider is actually
        someone rather rare.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Are you offering terms to me?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Enough!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Feeling that Rider might make some attempts of flattery, Lancer and
        Saber simultaneously refused him. Saber continued with disappointment
        written on her face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Besides... I am also that lord that rules the kingdom of Britain. No
        matter what kind of a king one is, he can never bow before another
        lord."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh? The king of Britain?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider showed interest in Saber's declarations and raised his eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How surprising. The renowned King of Knights is actually a young girl."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        " &ndash; And would you like to try the blade of that young girl, King
        of Conquerors?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber lifted her sword as she lowered her voice. Her left hand was still
        powerless to hold the sword; its four fingers were just resting on the
        hilt. The fighting spirit that rose wavering from the blade, however,
        was more solemn and majestic then when she fought Lancer. Rider furrowed
        his brows and let out a long sigh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My &ndash; breakdown of negotiations, is it. What a waste, that's too
        bad."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When Rider looked down and mumbled to himself, he found the glance that
        was full of hatred that looked up from beside his feet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ri, de, eeer..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had the pain that came with his swollen forehead, but his regrets
        were more tragic than that pain. Waver's deep cries passed through the
        air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Nooow what? Talking again and again about conquest, and people still
        dislike you... do you really think you can beat Saber and Lancer?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The stocky Servant faced his master's questions with no sign of remorse,
        but began to laugh heartily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Er, well, wasn't there a saying that says actions speak louder than
        words?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "And your action is just to say your true name out loud like that!?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver was so angry that his head was dizzy. Using his two weak fists, he
        continued to hammer at the breastplate of Rider, who was just standing
        there, and started to cry tears. Looking at this sad situation, Irisviel
        felt neither contempt nor sympathy. She just felt that she couldn't take
        it anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The atmosphere that had subtly relaxed &ndash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh? It is you, of all people."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &ndash; Suddenly became tense again with the low, resentful voice that
        crept along the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was the still-concealed Master of Lancer. Ever since he had urged the
        Servant to use his Noble Phantasm, the observation had been very quiet.
        Now he was interjecting to ask Waver's purpose in coming here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a sound that was completely different from the tone used before;
        something that exposed a heart drunk with hatred.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "And I was wondering what you stole my Holy Relic for in your outrage
        &ndash; I didn't think you would actually have the guts to join the
        Heaven's Feel on your own, Waver Velvet."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver heard someone calling his name with malice and knew that he was
        the subject of that hatred. Not only that, Waver may be able to guess
        the owner of that voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ah... uh..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        How could he not predict it? With his rank as high as lecturer of the
        Clock Tower, Holy Relics for other Heroic Spirits can still be prepared
        even if Alexander's cloak was stolen. Therefore, at the land of Fuyuki,
        it is not a surprising thing to have this man standing before Waver as
        his enemy...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What a pity. It's a shame, really. I actually wanted my poor beloved
        student to be happy. Waver, someone as mediocre as you only deserves to
        possess the calm and stable life of commoners."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver was dazed with delusions, unable to determine where the voice came
        from. He no longer knew how many times he had experienced the nauseating
        feeling in his stomach &ndash; Lecturer Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald. The
        feeling of having those crystal blue eyes that held a mixture of
        humiliation and pity, which glared down at Waver from the lecturer's
        mean and slender face somewhere above the boy's head &ndash; he felt it
        acutely once again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver wanted to return some smart remarks to the lecturer. Waver had,
        before his lecturer had managed, skilfully made the Heroic Spirit
        Alexander into a Servant that obeys him. Was that not the best revenge
        for the humiliation that he suffered at the Clock Tower for such a long
        time?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yes. It is no longer a relationship of teacher and student. He is now my
        true enemy. I can hate him as much as I want, even going as far as
        taking his life. Now he is undoubtedly my real opponent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During the few years that Waver spent at the Clock Tower, he had always
        hated that haughty lecturer in every waking and sleeping moment, even
        considering killing him for a few times &ndash; yet, it was the first
        time that he was faced with such enmity from his lecturer. The youth
        Waver experienced the gaze of a true magus that was full of the desire
        to kill for the first time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">However &ndash; the reverse is also true.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The owner of the voice saw the petrified fear on Waver's face with his
        sharp sight. With a tone of icy mockery that sent Waver's hair to stand
        on its end, he continued to speak as if toying with Waver.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Well, I can't help it, Waver-kun. Let me give you some extra tutorials.
        The true meaning of the slaughter between magi &ndash; I will pass the
        terror and the pain of the kill onto you without any reservation. You
        should be proud."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In fact, Waver was already shivering with fear, not even paying
        attention to the humiliation brought by those words.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To become a true magus, one must be prepared to be killed... A theory
        that was usually comprehended through books was keenly felt by Waver.
        The glare that the man shot from who-knows-where was more lethal still.
        The moment when a magus wanted to kill is the moment when the death
        sentence is pronounced &ndash; Waver did not know that until now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, something enclosed the slender lone shoulders of the boy, which
        was shivering from terror, in a gentle and powerful embrace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver was befuddled of the rough yet gentle touch. The hand of the
        stalwart Servant &ndash; with coarse fingers that are thick with
        calluses could only induce dread from the short Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oi, magus. If I understand correctly, you were supposed to be my Master
        instead of that kid, apparently."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider called out to the unseen Master of Lancer. In fact, his face was
        covered and twisted by a huge smile of malevolent pity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That thought is beyond ridiculous. The man that deserves to be my
        Master should be a warrior that rides with me into the battlefield, not
        a coward that doesn't even dare to show his face."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Silence descended; only the anger of the unseen Master could be felt
        spreading along the night air. Rider suddenly laughed into the empty
        sky, a roaring laugh that exhausted the airs in his lungs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Come on out! There must be others. Friends that are hiding in the
        darkness and spying on us!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Saber and Lancer were both shocked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"&ndash; What are you doing, Rider?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing an inquiring Saber, the King of Conquerors did a thumb-up
        accompanied with a hearty smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Saber and Lancer, your frontal battle is most excellent and fine. The
        clear sound made from the clashing of sword and spear would perhaps
        attract more than one Heroic Spirit, don't you agree?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel was trembling at the thought that Kiritsugu might have been
        discovered in his unknown hiding place, but Rider only had other
        Servants in mind. Rider wanted to deliver the deafening sound to every
        corner of the surroundings, and bellowed once again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What a shame. What a shame, really! The heroes of might gathered at
        Fuyuki! Seeing the prowess displayed here by Saber and Lancer, does it
        not invoke any sentiments from you? Having a name that deserves praise,
        yet concealing yourself and spying in secrecy; what cowardice. Even
        Heroic Spirits would be troubled upon hearing this, huh?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After another fit of laughter, Rider tilted his head with a fearless
        expression at the corner of his mouth, and ended with a challenging
        glance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Heroic Spirits invited by the Holy Grail, gather here at this
        moment! For those cowards that fear to show their faces, spare yourself
        the humiliation that Alexander, King of Conquerors, would deal to you.
        Prepare yourself!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider's enthusiastic speech even passed to Emiya Kiritsugu, who was
        hiding in the distant container port conducting his observation. It was
        also heard by Maiya, opposite Kiritsugu's position.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The minds of ancient heroes were so far removed from Kiritsugu's own
        that he couldn't even sigh in response.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...That fool managed to conquer the world?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Opposite the intercom, Maiya also appeared like she could not understand
        the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like Kiritsugu and Maiya, the secretly-observing Kirei also saw all of
        Rider's actions and heard his senseless words through Assassin's eyes
        and ears. At the moment Kirei was at the distant Fuyuki church, and
        Kirei had told everything he saw and heard to Tōsaka Tokiomi through the
        jewel communicator beside him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... This is bad."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the distant Tōsaka residence such an irate sentence was heard.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        Although Kirei knew the speaker couldn't see him, he furrowed his brows
        and nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Indeed it is."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi and Kirei did not disregard Rider's nonsense talk like Emiya
        Kiritsugu did. The reason was that they both thought of one particular
        Heroic Spirit, who would never ignore something like Rider's challenging
        words.
