      <p class="calibre3">
        Uryū Ryūnosuke disliked splatter movies. He did understand the necessity
        for that kind of amusement in itself, though.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not just horror, but war movies, panic movies, and all the way to
        adventure movies and dramas; why does fiction keep painting man's death
        tirelessly?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That may be, because the spectators can minimize their fear of death by
        observing a fictitious imitation of "death".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Humans find pride in "wisdom" and dread in "ignorance". Hence if they
        can "experience" and "comprehend" a given fear, then it is a victory
        that resembles the overcoming of that fear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, "death" is merely... something that you can't experience while
        you live. Therefore it is impossible to understand its true meaning.
        That's why humans can only guess the essence of death by observing other
        people's death, and make up a virtual experience.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Indeed, for the civilized society to respect human life, this virtual
        experience cannot but rely on fiction. Yet, where war makes your
        neighbor minced meat with bombing and land mines, nobody watches horror
        movies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Similarly, it is important to be entertained by fictional physical pain,
        mental stress or any kind of sorrow. When experiencing bodily sensations
        by yourself becomes too risky, you can overcome and remove uneasiness by
        observing those who do taste those sensations. ―That's why a silver
        screen or a cathode-ray tube bring tears of screams, grief and anguish.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That is good. That's understandable. Once, Ryūnosuke feared "death" like
        any ordinary person. He could have been an amateur of horror movies, if
        death could have been minimized and fear conquered by looking at the
        special make-ups of slaughtered bodies, the red ink of blood splashes
        and the realist acting reproducing a screaming "stale death".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Depiction of cruelty in fiction has a bad influence on young people,
        that much can be said; but to Uryū Ryūnosuke, this is highly ridiculous
        nonsense. Because if blood and screams in splatter horror had been at
        least a little more realistic, he wouldn't have become a homicidal
        maniac.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is, really, nothing but the result of an earnest curiosity.
        Ryūnosuke just had to know what "death" was. The vivid red of the
        haemorrhagic artery, the touch and the warmth of what was inside the
        abdominal cavity. The agony of the victim getting these pulled out until
        death, the musical tone of the screams. There really was nothing that
        could beat that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        People say murder is a crime. But let's think about it. Aren't there 5
        billions of humans crowding on this Earth? Ryūnosuke knows well how
        outrageous a number that is. Because he counted the gravels in the park
        when he was a kid. Of course he got discouraged after ten thousand, but
        he didn't forget the frustration he felt that time. There are five
        hundred thousand times that many humans. Furthermore, it is said that
        the number of births and deaths everyday can be counted by the tens of
        thousands. What weight can Ryūnosuke have by becoming a murderer?
        Beside, by killing people one by one, Ryūnosuke can perfect each of
        their death thoroughly. Occasionally, he enjoys making sure the "process
        of death" takes up to half a day. With this incentive and experience,
        the information volume brought by one death can be much more important
        compared to what you can get by living a too short life. From Uryū
        Ryūnosuke's reasoning, can't you say that homicide is a more productive
        action?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With that creed, Ryūnosuke wandered around in various places,
        accumulating murders. He didn't fear the law. The feeling of being
        imprisoned and handcuffed ―however many men it would actually require
        for that― was something he definitely "understood" to the point of not
        fearing it; he had "observed" enough deaths by hanging or on the
        electric chair for that. But his reason for escaping the law was,
        simply, because there is nothing to gain from being taken away from
        freedom and life in prison; hence he considered that living a life
        seeking everyday pleasure was better, that it was the right choice for a
        healthy man.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He is satisfied by squeezing the best out of the life force of those he
        kills, of feelings such as the attachment for human life, anger and
        affection. To let his victims know the exact time and circumstances of
        their death, that in itself had a deep meaning as rich as a miniaturized
        life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When on the verge of death, very common people will behave strangely,
        and on the other hand, people seen as exceptional will die in an
        extremely banal way― observing such patterns in humans, Ryūnosuke
        pursued death; and while being an expert in death, he greatly studied
        its complete opposite, life. The more he killed people, the more he
        understood the lives he took.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That knowledge, that discernment in itself was a kind of dignity, a
        style.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Ryūnosuke couldn't find the words to accurately explain why he
        had that power― if he really had to sum it up, it would be all with the
        expression "be cool".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To make a comparison, it's like sprinkles in a bar or crags spraying
        around. Unable to get used to such a playground, loosening without
        knowing one's place, and not understanding one's amusement. But if it is
        about accumulating experience and adopting a rule of conduct, then he is
        a welcome regular customer in a place where he can control the mood into
        intimacy. That's what it is to be cool as a way of life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        So to speak, Ryūnosuke was a genuine player when it comes to be familiar
        with the comfort of the stool that is human life. Like that, he could
        look for victims savoring a cocktail of new methods, appreciating the
        taste of satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This isn't some sort of metaphor; in the town, at night, Ryūnosuke's
        pleasure was his excellency in attracting victims like light traps for
        insects, with a certain interest in the opposite sex. Moreover, women
        were, certainly, charmed by the composure and dignity that emerged from
        his enigmatic posture. After seduction, he would always enjoy some
        alcohol, and the girls he really got into always ended as a
        blood-stained piece of meat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The town at night would always be Ryūnosuke's hunting ground, and the
        prey would never notice the menace that is Ryūnosuke.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Once, he saw a leopard in some animal program, and was enchanted by its
        elegance. He felt a connection with the brilliant modus operandi of the
        hunt. The leopard was the beast with a cool way of life that became his
        model, literally.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since then, Ryūnosuke ended up being self-conscious of his image of a
        leopard. He was always wearing clothes with something from a leopard.
        Jacket or pants, shoes or hat, or if that was too showy, he even had
        socks or underwear, handkerchief or gloves. He had an amber-colored
        cat's-eye ring, always in his pocket even when he couldn't slip it on
        his middle finger, and he would always carry on himself a pendant made
        with a real fang.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre5">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        So, this murderer named Uryū Ryūnosuke has just recently started feeling
        down with a serious loss of motivation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After some 30 victims, his methods for execution and torture has started
        losing its freshness as they all look the same. Testing all the
        techniques he can come up with, even when Ryūnosuke witnesses their
        dying agony, teasing his preys has already lost the taste of excitement
        and stimulation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        Deciding to return to the place of his origin, Ryūnosuke came home after
        some 5 years, breaking into the backyard storehouse as his parents had
        fallen asleep in this late night. It was in this storehouse that he had
        taken his first victim, and it was now crumbling, abandoned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Meeting again after 5 years, his sister's body had completely changed,
        but she waited for her brother at the place Ryūnosuke had hidden it. The
        silent meeting with his sister gave him no particularly strong emotion,
        and Ryūnosuke was disappointed that he had come for nothing; but at that
        moment, he found a rotten old book from the mountain of junk crammed in
        the warehouse.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The thin worm-eaten book was not a printed copy but an individual note.
        The postscript says ninth year of the Keiō era. This writing is more
        than a hundred year old, dating back to the end of the Bakumatsu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Having occasionally tapped into Chinese books during his student days,
        Ryūnosuke could actually read the notes without much difficulty. But the
        problem was the content itself. The incoherent writing of thin
        characters was preposterous nonsense about some kind of dark magic.
        Moreover, the inscriptions involved Christianity and Satan; apparently
        it was about some western occults. Offering human sacrifices to
        otherworldly demons to invoke spirits; that was definitely fiction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the dying hours of the era of Edo, studying western knowledge was a
        genre of heresy. While a book about the occult, the most heretic of
        heresy, could only be a prank, Ryūnosuke had some admiration for it, and
        he cared little about its authenticity. It was already quite cool and
        funky to keep just the old book on the occult from the storehouse. That
        was enough of a stimulus to renew his inspiration as a homicidal maniac.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At once, Ryūnosuke made the place a "spiritual ground" as described in
        the notes, then resumed his night time reading. He didn't know just what
        meaning the land now called the town of Fuyuki had, but Ryūnosuke was
        setting up the important points of the mood for new killings; he
        followed the instructions of the old book as faithfully as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he first sacrificed a girl who had run off to play at night in an
        abandoned factory, the stimulus was more interesting than expected. The
        style of the sacrificial ritual totally captivated Ryūnosuke despite his
        inexperience. He became infatuated with the method, and after three
        failed attempts, the peaceful provincial city was struck with fear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        Like that, Uryū Ryūnosuke broke into the house of a four person family
        for the fourth crime; he was by then completely intoxicated with ecstasy
        in the midst of the crime, and of course he started cooling off after
        repeating the same crime for the fourth time. The voice of reason in his
        head started whispering in his ears.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke had accumulated crimes as he wandered all over the country. He
        never killed twice on the same spot, and always disposed scrupulously of
        the body. Most of Ryūnosuke's victims are, even now, being searched as
        missing persons.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But this time, a series of crimes without hiding the remains would warn
        people quickly; this definitely was folly. Obsessed with the method, he
        had completely forgotten about his usual prudence. This one was
        particularly bad. For the three previous ones, he had tried to draw the
        magic circle with blood, and mistakes made him go short on blood. So
        this time, to draw a perfect circle, he had decided to kill a little
        more than usual; but really, slaughtering a whole sleeping family might
        be a little too sensational. The police will be in a frenzy and everyone
        in the region will be increasingly wary. Going into hiding is definitely
        not the style of a ‘leopard’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke finally decided ― for the time being, let's leave the city of
        Fuyuki quiet. He will stick with the black mass as he quite liked the
        result, but he would have to reduce the number from 3 to 1 at a time for
        safety purpose.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After sorting up his feelings, a renewed Ryūnosuke decided to
        concentrate on the ritual again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "♪ Fill, fill, filling, fill. With each repetition, four times― eh, five
        times? Err, only when it's full, break it up... Is it? Yeah."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Reciting the summoning chant, Ryūnosuke drew on the wooden floor of the
        living room with his bloody brush. The ceremony really is some serious
        business; that ambiance isn't Ryūnosuke's style at all. The serious mood
        was for his personal satisfaction; after all, what's important is the
        feeling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Having practiced the magic circle all night, he finished it in one go.
        There was no need for reserves anymore, then. Even though he had killed
        the parents and the eldest daughter to draw their blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "♪ Fill, fill, filling, filling, fill, there. That's five times alright.
        Okay?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leftover blood seemed suitable for some fine art on the walls of the
        room. Waiting for a reaction, he turned toward the last survivor rolled
        up in the corner― a grade school boy gagged with a rope. The young kid
        was crying, his eyes swollen, looking at his torn up sister and parents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Say― boy, do you believe in demons?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Asking the shivering kid, Ryūnosuke tilted his head in a dramatic act.
        Obviously, he wasn't expecting a reply: with his mouth gagged, all the
        kid could do was tremble in fear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You know, newspapers and magazines keep calling me a demon. But ain't
        it weird? A single stick of dynamite would do more victims at once than
        me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kids are nice. Ryūnosuke liked kids. Frightened adults cry and scream,
        so on that part, kids really are better. You can just laugh it off when
        they get incontinent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Nah, it’s fine. I'm kind of a demon. But if there were real demons
        beside me, I'd like to try to talk a little with them. Now that'd be
        nice. " 'Sup, name's Uryū Ryūnosuke, I'm a demon!" how does that sound
        for an introduction? That should be a good opportunity to make sure of
        it. If real demons exist or not..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His good humor improving, Ryūnosuke tested his charm on the trembling
        kid. Normally, talking was annoying, but looking at blood― and standing
        in front of someone on the verge of death, he seemed to change and
        started getting loquacious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The blood of 3 people was enough, and that was his only reason for
        letting the youngest child live. Though he did think he'd take the time
        to enjoy killing him later, after the completion of the ceremony―
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Anyway. If by any chance, a demon really comes out, wouldn't it be
        stupid to not have anything to drink and chat? So, boy... If Mr. Demon
        here does pay me a visit, how about a little killing?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The young kid could understand well enough Ryūnosuke's idea. Ryūnosuke
        beamed when the kid, his eyes wide open, started twisting and struggling
        around without a scream.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I wonder how it is to be killed by a demon. Will it go zip or splash,
        that gotta be some fun to watch. Not something you see everyday― ah
        ouch!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The unexpected sting was like a cold shower on Ryūnosuke's frenzy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was the back of his right hand. He felt an intense pain as if he
        had bathed his hand in a powerful poison. As soon as the pain started,
        the swelling calmed down and stuck on the surface of his skin.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... What the, hell? This..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Somehow, a pattern like a tattoo was there on his pained right hand, and
        he had no idea why.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Eeh."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rather than feeling anxious, Ryūnosuke reacted dandily. That
        incomprehensible pattern of three intertwined snakes resembled some
        tribal tattoo, which didn’t look half bad.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But his foppishness lasted only a moment; Ryūnosuke turned around in
        surprise when he felt the air move behind him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The air grows hot. A current that shouldn't be possible indoors. Soon,
        the breeze changed into a whirlwind blowing in the living room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke stared at the magic circle drawn on the floor with fresh blood
        as it unbelievably started emitting a phosphorescent light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did expect some sort of abnormality to occur, but― such a blatant
        phenomenon was beyond his anticipation. Something big, just like in the
        horror movies Ryūnosuke despised. These childish effects were so
        laughable it wasn't funny, but it was definitely real.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The violent gust was now trampling the room, blowing off the TV, the
        flower vase and other furniture. In the center of the magic circle, a
        mist started rising, and sparks scatter. The scene was otherworldly, but
        Uryū Ryūnosuke was definitely not scared. He was he child staring at a
        magic trick, his chest dancing from expectation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Fascination for the unknown―</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The enchantment once discovered in the marvel called "death". The
        radiance that disappeared unnoticed when he grew tired of accumulating
        murder, right now―
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">A flash. Then a roaring sound like a thunderbolt.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The impact ran past Ryūnosuke's body. The feeling was like being fried
        by a high-tension current.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The strange power once passed through the Uryū family. Now forgotten by
        its descendants, but still carried through their blood uninterrupted,
        the 'Magic Circuits' had been sleeping until this day inside Ryūnosuke;
        that inherited mystery was now unleashed like a tidal wave. And that
        "alien power" flowing in Ryūnosuke has just now started running in him,
        then streaming back outside to the thing invited from the underworld.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ―So to speak, this was an exception amongst exceptions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To begin with, the Grail of Fuyuki itself requires seven Servants. It
        isn't the capable ones who summon Servants and try to become Masters.
        The Grail will pick appropriate persons until the count reaches seven.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The summoning of a Servant is also fundamental for the Grail. The hard
        work magi put into the ritual is only a precaution to create a bond with
        a perfect, reliable Servant. Even with an unskilled summoning circle and
        without chanting the spell, if a human has a catalyst, the requirements
        for the Grail can be met...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"―I ask of you"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From inside the enveloping haze, a soft yet strangely carrying voice
        called out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The wind had stopped unnoticed. The light had left the magic circle, the
        radiance was disappearing, and the circle drawn on the floor with fresh
        blood was blackened as if burned up. And from inside the fading mist,
        the owner of the voice earlier suddenly showed his figure to Ryūnosuke.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A young face without a single crease yet. A pair of large, hulling eyes
        and greasy cheeks. Along with the deathly pallor of his face, he
        reminded Ryūnosuke of a painting from Munch.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His garments too were quite odd. His figure, tall enough to reach the
        clouds, was wrapped in a much-folded robe, decorated with luxurious
        latches made of precious metals; his whole style looks exactly like some
        "evil magician" from a manga.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You who called me, you who requested for me, summoning the spirit of
        the Caster class... I ask for your name. Who are you?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke gave a small response. The one who had come out of the
        summoning circle with great flashes and smokes― was an ordinary human.
        That was definitely not what he had expected. No exaggerated monster,
        just a perfectly normal human? Ryūnosuke was puzzled. His clothes were
        definitely queer, but did that mean this man was a real demon?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Scratching his head for a moment, Ryūnosuke took his decision.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Uh, name's Uryū Ryūnosuke. I'm a freelancer. My hobby is murder in
        general. I like kids and young women. Recently I'm back to sharpening my
        basis again."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man in robe nodded. Apparently he had ignored everything beside the
        name.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Very well. The contract is complete. Your desire for the Holy Grail is
        my desire as well. We shall make the cauldron of heaven ours."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Holy― Grail&nbsp;?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the moment, Ryūnosuke didn't get what it was about. Right, thinking
        again, didn't the old book found in the storehouse mention something
        like that? And he had skipped it because the passage was dull.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Yeah well, let's save the troublesome talk for later."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke waved his hand lightly, before pointing with his chin at the
        kid rolled up in the corner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "For now, let's talk over a drink. Won't you eat that?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The other man, with a face as expressionless as a mask, gauged the tied
        kid and Ryūnosuke. Feeling anxious, Ryūnosuke couldn't tell by the
        silence if his words and intentions had hit home. Maybe that was asking
        for too much. After all, who decided that demons eat children?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Silently, the man picked a book from a pocket of his robe. The bulky
        book appeared to be an antique treasure from an ancient era. No doubt it
        was some gadget of the demon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke noticed in one glance what hide the cover was made of.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ah, cool! That's human skin, right?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke can recognize it because he once tried to put up a lamp shade
        with human skin pelt off a victim. Eventually, he got discouraged at his
        poor handicraft midway, but he can't help but respect an elder who has
        achieved a similar work through the end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man, casting only a glance at Ryūnosuke, ignored his compliment and
        gently opened the book, his hand rapidly flipping through the pages; he
        then muttered one or two words that made no sense, and as if it was
        enough, closed the book before putting it back in his pocket.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...&nbsp;?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Leaving the helpless Ryūnosuke, the man walked toward the boy rolled up
        on the floor. At the strange events that had kept happening, the boy
        winced harder as if death was inevitable, trying to crawl away from the
        man.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the child in such a state, the man seemed suddenly full of
        compassion and kindness, which startled Ryūnosuke. What does that mean?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"― You have nothing to be afraid of, my boy."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unlike what his odd appearance suggested, the strange man gently spoke
        to the boy. The imprisoned kid gradually notices his warmth, and looks
        at the man questioningly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As a reply, the man gives a smiling nod, bending toward the boy and
        extending his hand at him― gently untying his ropes and gag.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Can you stand?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As an encouragement, the man patted the boy on the back, helping him up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, Ryūnosuke had no doubt the man was a devil, but he was really
        dissatisfied with how he was treating the child. Is he actually going to
        let him live?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Anyway, no matter how you looked at him, the man is queer. When silent,
        his features would look dreadful like the face of a corpse, but when
        smiling without any apparent maliciousness, he would seem as pure as a
        saint.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Now, my boy, the door over there will lead you out of this room. Don't
        look around, walk straight forward by yourself. Can you do that by
        yourself?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Yes..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the boy's brave nod, the man responded with a bright smile, softly
        pushing his back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The boy started running lightly across the bloodstained living room, as
        he avoided looking at the corpses of both his parents and his sister as
        instructed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hum, hey..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course Ryūnosuke couldn't ignore it all and spoke, but the man
        quickly interrupted him with a hand sign. Overpowered, Ryūnosuke
        helplessly watched the kid escape.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The boy opened the door and stepped into the corridor. In front of him
        was the entranceway. His eyes drowned in fear until then were now
        shinning again in hope and relief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The climax came the next instant.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The boy was leaving the stairs behind him, facing the entranceway. From
        the second floor, invisible from the living room, something suddenly
        fell down in an avalanche on the young boy. A bundle of heavy ropes ―
        no, a flock of countless snakes ― an indescribable life form, or rather,
        a living creature twined around the boy's whole body, and with an
        otherworldly force, took away the young body up to the second floor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then― a soul-rending scream. The clicking tongues of an infinite number
        of creatures, and the echo of small bones crushed. The rashness of
        whatever was happening on the upper floor easily stimulated imagination
        even without witnessing it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The strange man closed his eyes and raised his face, listening to the
        nightmarish sound, drunk it in attentively. His hand shivered.
        Apparently he was deeply moved.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But the emotion was just as great for Ryūnosuke... No, as he didn't
        expect something like that to happen; the catharsis was far more intense
        for him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"There is a certain freshness in fear."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The lingering memory of the horror he had himself planned out hadn't
        drawn out yet ―there now was no remaining doubt he was a devil― when he
        started speaking, and his voice sounded like he was entranced in a
        dream.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Fright is about the feeling that you will die. The true meaning of
        terror doesn't lie in a static condition, but in a change― this is the
        instant when hope is turned into despair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">How was it? The smell of fresh fear and death."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"― Kh ―"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ryūnosuke was at loss of words.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The 'thing' that was feasting on the kid's remains upstairs was,
        apparently, the man's doing. He was the one who had appeared from the
        bloody magic circle, after all. There was no possible doubt something
        had happened when he had opened his book with the binding made out of
        human skin.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The method was nerve-racking, but that is what is splendid in this
        philosophy. Ryūnosuke was no match for the creativity and perfect
        aesthetics of such evilness. Him who held such a vivid and moving
        "aesthetics of death" deserved the greatest praises.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Cool! That's wicked! Man, that was super cool!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Feeling like dancing with joy, Ryūnosuke grabbed the man's hand and
        shook it. Making friends with this strange man was no less moving than
        meeting a celebrity. The mass murderer Uryū Ryūnosuke finally felt
        adoration and respect from the depth of his heart for someone in this
        boring world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Okay! I don't know about this Grail thing, but I'll follow you! I'll
        help you in whatever you want. We'll kill more. There are plenty of
        sacrifices. Show me more of your cool killings!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You are a pleasant fellow."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Understanding of Ryūnosuke's emotion, the man replied gently to his
        violent handshake with a pure smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ryūnosuke, was it? It is a good omen I got a Master as understanding as
        you. This is developing more and more into an ideal situation for my
        aspirations."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When a summoning is made without a catalyst, the Heroic Spirit will be
        one that has a similar mindset as the Master. The one summoned by the
        vicious murderer was one who had left his name on extremely cruel acts;
        he was a Heroic Spirit with a taste for true tyranny. Or rather, based
        on that nature, it would be more suitable to call him a vengeful spirit
        instead of a heroic spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ah―, right, I didn't get to hear your name."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Remembering about the important parts, Ryūnosuke started acting more
        familiarly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My name, yes. Indeed. For this era, you could call me..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man put a finger to his lips, then after thinking a little,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Then, for now, you can call me "Bluebeard". Pleased to meet you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">He replied familiarly with an angelic smile.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, for the last position of the fourth Heaven's Feel ― the Master and
        his Servant 'Caster' completed the contract. This is how, without
        knowing the meaning of the Grail War or his nature as a magus, the
        casual murderer received Command Seals and a Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">For a trick of fate, this may be the foulest play.</p>
