      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver had expected the day to end at the peak of triumph with a
        successful summoning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the previous night spent in a fierce battle with the cackling
        chickens, he had studied in his bed this night, satisfied with the
        pleasant weariness of accomplishment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">And &mdash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... How, did this happen?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a dry wind blowing strongly over the public park of the Shinto
        area, Waver sat on the bench, curling in the lonely coldness. He still
        couldn't understand, ‘’just how on Earth did my plan go wrong’’?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The summoning was a success. That was a satisfactory response.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Along with the successful summoning, the status of the invited Servant
        was still imprinted in Waver's consciousness. He was of the Rider class.
        Although that isn't one of the three major knights, his basic abilities
        still were at a more than average level. Without a doubt, he was a
        powerful Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment he saw the silhouette of the big frame slowly rising from the
        summoning circle, behind the white smoke, Waver was so exalted he almost
        came in his pants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ... Thinking about it, the situation had turned for the worse at around
        that point.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From Waver's knowledge, a "familiar" is the puppet of its summoner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An existence that can barely survive in the present world by relying on
        the prana supplied by the magus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A wooden doll that can be used as the practitioner pleases. That's what
        a familiar is, essentially. So he had guessed a Servant would be
        basically the same, more or less.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But that thing that came out of the summoning circle&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        Right from the start, Waver's soul was overtaken by the sharpness of the
        eyes, glowing like a blaze.
      </p>
      The instant the eye contact was made, he had instinctively sensed that the
      Servant was a mighty one, and was overwhelmed like a small animal.
      <div class="svg_outer">

        </svg>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The overwhelming presence of the giant blocked his view. From the body
        odor he picked up, the fragrant of the muscular stature, Waver
        understood. Never mind the quibble about him being a ghost or a
        familiar, he sure is a HUGE guy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver knew that the Heroic Spirits invited by the Grail are not only
        free spirits; they gain a material "body" to exist in the present world.
        But, the cluster of massive muscles that was the actual entity, not a
        virtual image or a shadow, the feeling of impending threat, was beyond
        Waver's imagination.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">No matter what, Waver hated the great man.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It's not just that Waver was, still, a bit shorter than an average
        person. Certainly, his body tended to be frail, because he had done
        nothing but study in his childhood, and had had little time to forge his
        body, but he didn’t think it was a weakness. Rather, Waver had pride in
        polishing up his intellect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But, the truth of such an obvious thing wouldn't get through the big
        man's muscles. No matter what, the time lag before such a game with a
        rock for a soul would lift his fist and swing it down is way too short.
        There is no time to expand into a discussion however brief, and there is
        also no future in using magecraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That is&mdash; once he is approached by the fist of that pack of
        muscles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... So, I'm asking you. You must be my Master, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hah?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was the big man's second question. A booming voice that could shake
        up the Earth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had been overpowered beyond his senses from the first question asked
        with a voice you couldn't fail to hear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ah&mdash; Yes! I-I-I-I'm, I mean, I am! I am your Master, I'm called
        Wa, Waver Velvet! I mean, that's my name! I'm your Master!!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though it really was useless in more than one way, Waver stuck to
        bluffing with all his might to stand up to the muscles in front of him.
        ... Even so, he felt dominated already by the physique of the unaware
        giant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hm, then the contract is complete. So, boy, can you lead me to some
        archives immediately?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hah?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver was blown out of his mind for the second time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Some books, I'm saying! Books."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The giant Servant repeated himself gloomily, leaning toward Waver,
        stretching a strong arm that looked like the root of a pine tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I'm going to be killed&mdash; Waver immediately thought, feeling like he
        was floating. The giant had seized his neck and carelessly lifted him.
        Waver hadn't noticed until then that he had fallen flat on the ground.
        He realized that was the reason his interlocutor had, mid-way, started
        looking even more like a giant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you are one of those magi, you should be able to provide some
        archive? Now, show me around. We need to prepare for war."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"W, war...&nbsp;?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that the giant mentioned it, Waver simply had totally forgotten
        about the Holy Grail War.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        Having lived as a blatant freeloader in a private house, Waver had no
        kind of archive, and reluctantly led Rider to the library.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The central library of the city of Fuyuki was in the public park in the
        Shinto area and was still under construction. Frankly, it felt awkward
        to walk through the city in the middle of the night &mdash;with the
        recent strange murder case, the police frequently announced a state of
        emergency&mdash; Waver felt that what the big muscles in front of him
        could do was a bigger crisis than being questioned by the patrolling
        police.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Fortunately, as soon as they came out of the grove, the giant turned
        invisible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That must be an ability the Servants have, to go into spirit form. Waver
        felt relieved as he wouldn't look suspicious walking along a big man
        with armored cloth, but he still felt the pressure of being followed by
        that overbearing presence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Luckily, they didn't meet anyone when crossing the big bridge of Fuyuki
        into the Shinto area; reaching the public park, Waver pointed at the
        modern architecture in the back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There should be as many books as you want over there."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, the oppression that was weighing on Waver softly went away.
        Apparently, Rider was entering the building in spirit form.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ―And so, it had been 30 minutes since he had been left behind. Released
        from the threat he didn’t comprehend, he was finally able to calmly sort
        his thoughts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... How, did this happen?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver buried his head in his hands, remembering his shameful behavior
        from earlier. However powerful, the Servant is his contractor. As the
        Master, Waver is the one who has to seize leadership.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Servant Waver had summoned definitely was strong. That was a given,
        considering the history of the relic he had stolen from Kayneth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Heroic spirit Alexander. Also known as Iskander or Alexandros.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The reason he was known under several names depending on the
        pronunciation of the land was that he was the heroic "King of
        Conquerors". Succeeding to the throne of Macedonia at only 20 years old,
        leading ancient Greece in an invasion of Persia, then through Egypt, up
        to western India during the great "eastern campaigns", and reaching the
        success of a great hero in barely 10 years. He literally is the "great
        king" who built the era known as the Hellenistic civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though he is such a great man amongst great men, once he is
        summoned as a Servant he cannot oppose his Master. The first reason to
        this is that in the present world, he depends on Waver. If Waver ever
        stops supplying him with prana for him to remain in the present era, he
        will have no choice but to disappear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There is a reason why all Servants answer the summoning of a Master―
        that is, why they participate in the Holy Grail War alongside their
        Master. Namely, just like the Masters, they want the Grail. Hoping to
        get that wish-granting machine, they also have to fight until only one
        remains, so that they will obtain the grace of the Grail along with the
        Master they accompany. In other words, the cooperation between the
        Master and the Servant is natural.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, the Masters also hold the trump cards that are the Command
        Seals.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All three Seals can be used one by one for 3 absolute orders. That is
        what defines the relationship between the Servant and the Master. The
        Servant cannot oppose an order from the Command Seals, even if it is
        something as unreasonable as an order to self-destruct. That is the
        central point of the contract system made up by one of the "three
        families of the beginning", the Makiris.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, the Master who uses up all 3 of his Command Seals is
        exposed to the danger of rebellion from his Servant; but it is a risk
        that can be avoided if the Master acts carefully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yes, as long as the Command Seals are carved on this hand― suppressing
        the irritation in his stomach, Waver, in a trance, stared at his right
        hand, chuckling― he might be a huge mass of muscles, but he has no
        reason to oppose the magus Waver Velvet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as that Servant comes back, I must tell that inviolable rule to
        his face...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, while Waver was thinking, a breaking sound heartily roared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hih!?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jumping out of surprise, he turned around as the closed shutter of the
        library hall were being distorted and torn off. The one who was calmly
        walking there, materialized under the moonlight, was none other than
        Waver's Servant, Rider.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With how dark the forest had been, this was actually the first time he
        could clearly see how he looked in this light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His height easily exceeded 2 meters. His unprotected arms and thighs
        spread out from his bronze armor, and from the size of the muscles all
        over his body he looked like he could kill a bear with his bare hands.
        On his sternly chiseled features there were eyes with a dazzling glow
        and burning red hair and beard. The thick mantle dyed in a similar red,
        with fringes like his cuffs, was luxuriously decorated, looking just
        like a curtain wrapping the stage of a theater.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The magnificent posture of that big man in front of the modern library
        made a somewhat funny combination, but Waver took no interest in that as
        the alarms resounding like a shrill got him ready to flee.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Idiot! Stupid, stupid, stupid! What were you thinking, kicking the
        shutters like that! Why aren't you in spirit form like when you
        entered!?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider strangely smiled out of good humor, holding out two books at the
        defiant Waver.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I couldn't pick up this when in spirit form, could I?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The books were one with a thick hardcover and a thin one. Apparently
        Rider had taken them from the library. But his Master couldn't afford to
        disturb public order for something so trivial.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Don't be slow! Run! We have to run!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How unsightly to be that flustered. You look like a thief or
        something."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What thief, what's wrong with you!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider was astonished by the threat in Waver's yell.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're greatly misunderstood. Those who run away under cover of the
        night are night burglars. Walking away victoriously is what the King of
        Conquerors does after looting."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        You just can't discuss anything with him, Waver thought, scratching at
        his head madly. At any rate, Rider apparently wanted to parade through
        the night with those two books, looking like a suspicious cosplayer,
        with no intention of turning back to spirit form.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the end of his wits, Waver rushed to Rider, picking the two books
        from his hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're done, now, right!? Now disappear! Disappear right now! Disappear
        immediately!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ooh, then I'll leave this to you. You don't have to repeat yourself
        like that."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Satisfied, Rider nodded then became invisible again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But Waver still couldn't feel relieved. The alarm of the library had to
        reach some security firm. You wouldn't know how long it would take for
        security guards to rush in.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Oh, what the heck, who cares.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Aah, damn― How― did this happen, man!?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver didn't know how many times he had lamented like that this night,
        but he just ran like hell.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre5">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he reached the promenade on the border of the broad bridge of
        Fuyuki, he felt he had run enough to be safe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ha―, ha―, ha―, ..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As someone who usually neglected himself, Waver felt his heart was on
        the verge of bursting from running such a hellish distance. Without the
        strength to even stand up, he knelt on the roadside― and took another
        look at the books Rider took from the library.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... An anthology of Homer's poetry? And... A world map? Why?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The luxurious book in a hardcover was from the famous poet of ancient
        Greece. The other thin book was a color print you would use for school.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From behind a puzzled Waver, a stern arm suddenly stretched out to pick
        the atlas up by the fingertips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Once again with a physical body, Rider heavily sat down cross-legged on
        the road and, in a clatter, started to turn the pages of the atlas taken
        back from Waver.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hey Rider, when you mentioned preparations for war..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You can't start a war without a map. Isn't it obvious?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Apparently pleased, Rider's face lit up in a grin, and he stared at the
        content of the atlas.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Apparently the end of the world has been discovered, and it even rolls
        up in a sphere... I see, that's what we have when we draw the round
        Earth on paper..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As far as Waver knows, when a Heroic Spirit is summoned as a Servant by
        the Grail, they receive minimum information so that their knowledge
        doesn't conflict with the current era. That means that even this ancient
        one should understand that the Earth is round. So Waver couldn't quite
        understand why Rider had acted like a thief to get something like a map.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"So... Hey boy, where are Macedonia and Persia?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver felt discouraged at Rider's usual arrogance in calling his Master
        "boy" instead of saying his name; still, he pointed his finger at a part
        of the atlas. At that moment―
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">―</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Wahhahhahaha!!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver was again dumbstruck by Rider's excited burst of laughter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hahahah! That's small! Only that on such a big Earth! Hm, good! I was
        worried by an era where there is no unknown land anymore... But if it's
        that big, then I'm fine!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suitable for his big frame, Rider's laughing voice was grand. Waver felt
        he'd rather face an earthquake or a tornado than oppose a man of that
        size.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Good, good! I'm excited! ... And us, boy, where are we on this map?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nervously, Waver pointed to Japan at the far East. Rider gave a groan of
        admiration, and,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hoho―h, at the opposite of the round Earth... Hm. That too is very
        pleasing. Our objective is even clearer, then."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Grimly stroking his chin, he gave a satisfied nod.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Objective?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "First we go halfway around the globe. Westward, straight west. We take
        over all the countries on the way. Upon my triumphal return in
        Macedonia, I will make all the people in my land celebrate my revival.
        Fufhuhu. How do you like that?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dumbstruck for a moment, Waver roared, still dizzy from anger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What the hell did you come here for! The Holy Grail War, the Grail!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider sighed, bored by Waver's threatening attitude.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But that’s just the outset. What's the fuss about―"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider sounded as if it had only just now occurred to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Right, the Grail, I should have asked about that first. Boy, what would
        you do of the Grail?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unable to read Rider's slow tone, Waver felt a chill he couldn’t
        describe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Why the change? Why do you ask?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I need to make sure of it. In case you too want to conquer the world,
        then that'll make you my enemy, right? There is no need for two supreme
        rulers."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was highly unreasonable of the Servant to say that so carelessly over
        his shoulder, almost turning his back to the Master and his Command
        Seals; yet Waver shuddered violently from the hints of cruelty in the
        big man's audacious voice. The overwhelming fear made him forget his
        fundamental superiority as a Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Th, that's stupid! The world, I don't..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Choking until then, Waver suddenly remembers the necessity of keeping
        his dignity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Conquering the world― Fuh, I have no interest in such a vulgar goal!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hoh?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider’s expression completely changed, staring at Waver with great
        interest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Do you mean that there is an aspiration greater than wanting the world
        for a young man? That's interesting. Do tell me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver sneered, then, with all his courage, started speaking haughtily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I... What I wish for, is only to be judged equitably. To renew the
        impression of my colleagues at the Clock Tower, who never acknowledged
        my talent―"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before he could finish speaking, an unequalled shock hit Waver.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Roughly at the same time, he heard Rider roar in his loud voice "That's
        small!", but the shock and the roar were so equally strong that Waver
        couldn't tell the difference.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In fact, Rider hadn't particularly put more strength than for slapping a
        mosquito; but that was too strong for the short and fragile magus, and
        Waver spun like a top then collapsed on the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Small! That's puny! Ridiculous! Is that all the ambition you would risk
        your life in battle for? And you're my Master? That’s really sad!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if he couldn't accept it, Rider proclaimed so to the magus with an
        amazed expression, far from anger but practically lamenting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"a― uh―"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver had never been confronted with such straightforwardness and
        violence. Being hit by the truth struck Waver's pride even more than the
        pain of his cheek.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver's lips shook with rage, the color drained from his face, but Rider
        didn't give it any consideration at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you want respect from others so much, right... I'll tell you boy,
        use the power of the Grail to grow by a good 30 centimeters. When you'll
        have a higher view over things, yeah, you will be looking at most people
        from above."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You... you... u"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was the greatest humiliation to him. More than rage, Waver felt
        dizzy as if suffering from anaemia, his whole body trembling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Unforgivable. That was plainly unforgivable.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That big man, a Servant, nothing more than an attendant, had completely
        denied Waver's pride and got away with it. Even a god wouldn't forgive
        such an insult. To Waver's dignity&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On Waver's right hand, clenched so tightly his nails could tear his
        palm&mdash; power flowed into the three Seals carved on the back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        'By these Command Spells &mdash; guardian of the order of the Grail
        &mdash; may that man, my Servant &mdash;'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">May Rider... make him what, exactly?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course he hadn't forgotten why he left the Clock Tower, why he came
        in this remote countryside in the far East.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was all to gain the Grail. That's why he summoned a Servant. Such a
        crisis with that Heroic Spirit he bounded with may happen twice. After
        the third time&mdash; the Command Seals are gone. That means a decisive
        defeat as a Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The first of these serious situations could not be right now, could it?
        Not even one hour after the summoning?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ashamed, Waver looked downward and breathed deeply several times; then
        by natural reasoning and calculation, he shut down the irritation in his
        heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Impatience leads nowhere. Certainly, Rider's attitude is hardly
        forgivable; but the Servant hasn't opposed his Master yet, nor has he
        disregarded any order.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver can brandish his whip only three times to hit this wild beast.
        Isn't it careless to use it when only barked at?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Having regained his composure, Waver finally looked up again. Rider was
        still sitting on the ground, disparaging his Master; or rather, having
        even forgotten his Master's existence, he was reading the atlas. Waver
        spoke at his incredibly wide back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you can just get the Grail, then I have no complaint. I don't care
        what you will do after that. You can fly wherever you want, Macedonia or
        the South Pole."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Fu&mdash;m. Rider breathed dispiritedly &mdash;or indifferently, you
        couldn't tell with his nasal breathing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Anyway. You're sure you have your priorities right? You will
        seriously participate in the Grail war?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ah, I got it already, yeah."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider lifted his face from the atlas and looked at Waver from over his
        shoulder with a depressed grumble.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The first thing is to beat 6 Heroic Spirits, right? That sounds
        troublesome, but certainly, without the Grail, I can't start anything.
        Rest assured. I'll get that treasure."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His speech was calm and composed, but Waver was not completely
        convinced.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, that Heroic Spirit was not a deception. As far as Waver can
        grasp by being a Master, the Servant he had been granted has outstanding
        abilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But in a conflict, Servants don't only compete on skills. The Holy Grail
        War isn't something so nice that you can move on with big muscles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You seem very confident, but what are your chances of victory?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a daring provocation, Waver put forth all his bluff to scowl at
        Rider. ‘’I'm a Master, of course I can afford a high-handed attitude’’;
        that's what he is thinking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"So, you say you want to see my power?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Catching his glance, Rider changed to a quiet tone that somehow made
        Waver uneasy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes, that's right. Isn't it obvious? I need proof that I can trust
        you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Laughing from his nose, the giant Servant pulled his sword from the
        scabbard at his waist. It was a valuable sword splendidly arranged, but
        it didn't feel like it had the prana of a Noble Phantasm in itself. Yet,
        when Rider took the sword, the dangerous atmosphere slowly made Waver
        uneasy. He can't be thinking of murdering me for my loud mouth...&nbsp;?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without noticing his Master trembling violently, Rider lifted his naked
        sword overhead,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "By this one strike, I, Alexander, King of Conquerors, claim for
        supremacy!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Having loudly called out to the empty sky, he violently swung down his
        blade at the empty space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just then, a thundering roar and a tremor shook the riverbed at night
        like a thunderbolt, in a magnificent shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His guts turned around, Waver lost balance and tumbled on the ground for
        the second time. If Rider's blade wasn't striking at anything, just what
        did it cut―
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver saw it. The empty space torn apart, like a gaping mouth, and the
        absurdly powerful thing that appeared there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">And, Waver remembered just what a Servant is.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the legend of a hero, there is not only the man that was the hero,
        but the anecdotes about him, his arms and weapons: all of this is the
        "symbol" of his existence. Those "symbols" are the ultimate mysteries
        that the Servant, the embodiment of the Heroic Spirit, carries as a
        trump card. Those are the deadly weapons commonly called "Noble
        Phantasms".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus― there is no mistake. That which appeared at the empty space struck
        by Rider, that must be, without a doubt, his Noble Phantasm. Hidden in
        this existence, the density of the outrageous magical power outside of
        normality: Waver can grasp that. That was a miracle that had transcended
        humanity, transcended magecraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's how I struck the shaft and got this. The offering to Zeus from
        the king Gordias. ... It must be because the reputation of this that I
        landed the Rider class."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a smile glowing with pride in front of that weapon, Rider didn't
        even sound like he was boasting; that must be the proof he has used it
        regularly, putting an immense faith in it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, that here was only the beginning. The Noble Phantasm I really rely
        on is yet something else. Well, when the opportunity appears, I'll show
        you. If I meet a formidable opponent worthy of it, that is."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In awe, Waver viewed Rider in a new light. Precisely because he is a
        magus, he understands the destructive power of the Noble Phantasm in
        front of him. Compared to a modern day weapon, that would rival a
        strategic bomber. He would transform the whole Shinto area into scorched
        earth if he was left wild for not even an hour.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There is no doubt left. Rider here is the strongest Servant Waver wished
        for. His might already surpasses Waver's imagination. If there is an
        enemy this man can not defeat, then it has to be an existence that
        cannot be taken down even by divine punishment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hey there boy, what's with the pale face, I haven't even begun yet."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Feeling malicious, Rider speaks to the fallen Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you want the Grail quickly, we should locate one or two Heroic
        Spirits rapidly. I'll immediately trample them. ... In the meantime, I
        can look at the atlas to kill boredom, you're fine with that, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His soul having left his face, Waver slowly nodded.
      </p>
