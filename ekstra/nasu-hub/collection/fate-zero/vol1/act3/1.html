      <p class="calibre3">Fuyuki city, Shinto―</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The housing district at the east of the Mion River is a new town
        reclaimed from a once empty wasteland; it is different from the history
        the Miyama town originally has, but it is being refined in a large-scale
        redevelopment project from the government to build a modern business
        district over the ancient site.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The buildings in the area planned as a business district are only 40%
        complete, but the maintenance of the park and shopping mall in front of
        the station is already done; the future plans are already done for the
        Shinto district to be clean and sterile, pompous and with no
        individuality. The city hall is also being moved piece by piece to
        Shinto, revived with modern iron, glass, and mortar, stealing all
        central municipal functions from Miyama.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It is already crowded even during holidays. In the middle of the crowd
        going back and forth, cowering from the northern wind, Emiya Kiritsugu
        disappeared, colorless and odorless without attracting any attention.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His shirt and coat worn for a long time and his lack of baggage give him
        a slacking appearance that wouldn't make you think of someone who has
        immigrated. As a matter of fact, he has been like that since he walked
        in the country up to Shinto in Fuyuki, but Japan still remains his
        native country. Being used to coming and going, he still felt better in
        this country.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a complex feeling, Kiritsugu looked down on the cigarette paper
        package he had just bought from a vending machine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It's been 9 years he has stopped smoking. He hasn't been able to find
        his favorite brand in the far land of the Einsberns, but that was mainly
        in regard for the mother and child. Just as he came down at the Fuyuki
        station, prepared for battle, he had thrown a coin in the vending
        machine out of habit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since he has bought a disposable lighter from a convenience store to get
        back the sensation, he breaks open the cigarette pack. The white of the
        row of filters is dazzling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He put one in his mouth and lit it. As if there wasn't a blank of 10
        years, he was able to redo the movements naturally. The aroma flowing
        into his lungs, he got used to the taste as if he had been doing it just
        the day before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu looks at the transformed scenery, completely different from
        the one he vividly remembers in his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He visited Fuyuki in reconnaissance under cover three years earlier, but
        the face of Shinto has completely changed since then. This isn't
        unexpected, but this is beyond what he imagined. He needs to confirm the
        neighborhood again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite the slight difficulty from the transformation of the area,
        Kiritsugu reached the hotel he wanted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The lobby and the front have been arranged, but the interior is a fairly
        cheap business hotel. Families or wanderers, this hotel is a good harbor
        for quite a wide genre of users.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Acting as if he knew the place, Kiritsugu walks through the lobby up to
        the elevator, up to the seventh floor. This is where his faithful
        subordinate has been for three days, in room 73.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the world of magi, his relation with Hisau Maiya would be that of a
        pupil and a teacher.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But to Kiritsugu, who saw magecraft as a mere tool he has acquired
        knowledge in, and not as the object of his quest, there wasn't a single
        sense of master and pupil. What he has taught to Maiya is merely a "way
        to fight". This too is only for the purpose of counting her as a "tool".
        This is from a time when he went through countless desperate battles for
        a utopia that could never be fulfilled, when he didn't know about the
        existence of the Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hence his connection to Maiya is older than the one with Irisviel.
        Having fought at his side, Maiya knows of the blood-stained side of
        Kiritsugu that his wife has never seen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he knocked at a pre-arranged rhythm on the door of room 73, the door
        opened immediately as if he had been expected. Skipping unnecessary
        greetings with a mere glance at each other, Kiritsugu enters the room
        and closes the door.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya has already been involved for a while. After Kiritsugu retreated,
        she has arranged the preparations for the Grail War according to the
        instructions given by Kiritsugu from overseas, and has been busy with
        returning to the Einsbern castle many times.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Handsome, fair-skinned, she was a beauty who used neither eye-liner nor
        lipstick. Her long eyes and her gaze seem to be always scrutinizing
        suspiciously, but she deliberately leaves an impression of indifference.
        Her jet black, silk-like straight hair catch the glance of many men but
        her cold, sharp look definitely makes any lady-killer give up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Anyway, they have known each other for over 10 years. She was still a
        young girl when they met, but since she isn't a child anymore, she
        sharpened her sagacity as a characteristic; when with that type of
        beauty, normal people tire easily, Kiritsugu was the opposite. She is a
        woman who constantly saw the reality, and could sometimes give out an
        accurate judgment more merciless than Kiritsugu. With her, Kiritsugu
        didn't have to be ashamed of his foul plays or detest his cruelty. This
        could put him to some sort of rest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The Tōsaka mansion moved last night."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Maiya started by jumping straight to the point.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Please watch the records of it. Also, all the equipment has arrived."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Understood. First, the situation."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nodding, Maiya switches the decoder of the unpacked television.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Amongst the magecraft Kiritsugu had taught her, Maiya was particularly
        capable in the management of regular familiars, and Kiritsugu often
        entrusted her with scouting or reconnaissance missions. This time again,
        Kiritsugu has assigned her to the surveillance of the Matō and Tōsaka
        mansions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The familiars Maiya has pride in are bats, but unlike other magi, her
        bats have a miniature CCD camera tied on the abdomen. Of course, this is
        an idea of Kiritsugu. The illusions and camouflaged bounded fields of
        magi are often based on using suggestions on an observer, but that sort
        of things often forget about electronic-based counter measures. Video
        records are also helpful for re-watching, so even considering it slows
        down the familiar the joint use of cameras is a viable solution.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The whole scene of the previous night is replayed on the 13 inch CTR.
        The blurred image is enough to understand the whole event. Without
        raising an eyebrow, Kiritsugu watches the Servant with a skull mask
        unable to escape annihilation from the golden Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The white mask of the defeated Servant is without a doubt of the
        Assassin class.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What do you make of it?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I think it is going too well."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Maiya replied immediately to Kiritsugu's question.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The time lag between Assassin's materialization and the attack of
        Tōsaka's Servant is too short. He was waiting for him. I could accept he
        might have detected an intruder in spirit form, but his opponent is an
        Assassin with the Presence Concealment ability. ... I wonder if Tōsaka
        wasn't aware of the invasion prior to it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu nodded. Having been trained by him, Maiya's conclusion was the
        same as Kiritsugu's.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The more I think of it, the more it seems like an arrangement. Why did
        Tōsaka expose his Servant like that if he had such a margin?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tōsaka family has obviously accumulated experience from the second
        and third Grail fights. There is no way they don't know the other
        Masters would be observing the Tōsaka mansion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heaven's Feel is a confrontation between heroes who have gained
        fame. And the legends of these heroes include a lot of information on
        their fighting patterns and their strong and weak points. This means it
        is natural that the skills and weaknesses of the Heroic Spirits are
        known from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And so, it has become an ironclad rule to hide the true identity of the
        Heroic Spirits in the war between Servants. In light of this, Heroic
        Spirits are all called by their class to avoid revealing their true
        name.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Last night, Tōsaka has left two clues to the other Masters, being what
        his Servant looks like, as well as showing a method that looks like a
        Noble Phantasm. Neither were enough to definitely identify the Servant,
        but that was a risk that should have been easy to avoid. If he was to
        bring down Assassin, he could have done so outside of plain view.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Showing us something he didn't have to show us― that means he wanted to
        show it to us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kiritsugu nods again at Maiya's conclusion.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Possibly. If there is any merit in doing that, then the explanation is
        obvious. ... Maiya, what happened to the Master of Assassin?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "He went to the Church last night and has requested the supervisor's
        protection. It is the man called Kotomine Kirei."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing that name, Kiritsugu's eye lit with a cold ghastliness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Maiya, send a familiar to the Fuyuki Church. One will be fine for now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Is it alright? The Church is an area where aggressions between
        Masters are prohibited."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Unless the priest supervisor doesn't find out. Stay at a reasonable
        distance. Don't overdo it. He doesn't have to know."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya frowned at Kiritsugu’s incomprehensible instructions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Must I observe the Church?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You can just make it a 'regular patrolling'. What you must concentrate
        on is being absolutely not-discovered."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Yes, understood."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya couldn't understand what Kiritsugu had in mind, but didn't
        question him. She at once picks one of the three bats observing the
        Tōsaka mansion and sent it the thought of going to the Fuyuki Church at
        the end of Shinto.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu turned off the TV, then resumed inspecting the equipment Maiya
        prepared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the various tools lined up on the sheet of the bed, awaiting
        Kiritsugu's check-up, there was not one a magus could find interesting.
        Not a single ritualistic catalyst like a dagger, cup, talisman, elixir
        or spiritual container. They were state-of-art and highly efficient, but
        apart from that, they were nothing but conventional weapons. Nothing
        that could store prana.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was the heresy that earned the magus Emiya Kiritsugu the nickname
        of "magus killer."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The weak point of the people called magi was usually negligence from
        arrogance. They believe in their own mysteries and knowledge. They never
        doubt that the only threat to them beside God cannot be anything other
        than a magus like them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That is why, in battle, they are sensitive to nothing but traces of
        magecraft. To detect any kind of trivial skill. Hence they train their
        perception of magecraft, and think of counter-measures against those
        skills as derisive― That's a theory no magus strays from.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As a result, they ignore any attack that is purely physical and void of
        magecraft as secondary menace. They have no fear of the sharpest knife,
        the strongest bullet, until the instant they actually pierce the flesh
        of a magus. And before that happens, the strength of magecraft grants
        illusions, paralysis methods, or defensive bounded fields, able to
        completely negate any vulgar attacks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But they despise technology. What a human who doesn't rely on magecraft
        can do― a lot of magi cannot recognize that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The attack the enemy doesn't expect is a shortcut for all battles.
        Kiritsugu has reached a conclusion from a large number of
        battles-to-the-death between magi. That is, magi are weak to non-magical
        attacks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Applying that conclusion to the circumstances of the Heaven's Feel of
        Fuyuki, Maiya has prepared a set of equipment. Among them, the rifle
        lying on the sheet is what gives out the strongest smell of varnish.
        That was a work of art that was the crystallization of the newest
        electronic techniques along with a ferocious shape.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The base is a Walther WA2000 semi-automatic sniper rifle. A rifle with a
        total length a little above 90 centimeters, in a compact size; the
        bullpup structure with a gas-operated magazine gives the gun barrel a
        length of 65 centimeters. The .300 Winchester Magnum shell has an
        effective range of 1000 meters. In the modern world, this is a rifle of
        the highest class, with the highest performance. The high cost of
        $12,000 is due to how it was one of the only 154 units produced for this
        legendary gun.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Instead of the standard sighting device made by Smith &amp; Bender,
        Kiritsugu had simultaneously installed a pair of lined-up devices as a
        special scope mount, above the barrel and on the left flank, both
        extra-large optic devices fixed in parallel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the main side was the latest night vision scope, the best of the US
        armed force, an AN/PVS04. The equipment, some sort of super sensitive
        video camera, is a simple light electrical amplifier with a lens,
        raising and displaying a perfect brightness. It is a real electronic
        "owl eye" that multiplies the range of vision by 3.6, 600 yards under
        the moonlight or 400 yards in starlight. Essentially, it is the latest
        equipment used by the US armed force, banned from exportation to prevent
        technology leaking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, in addition a specter IR heat detector scope is installed
        as a sideways support. This one is also electronically equipped for
        night vision, although the image display isn't an intensity amplifier,
        but displays the heat patterns of the subject. It can perceive
        temperature variations from -5 to 60°C up to 200 meters with an 1.8
        magnification.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Having discovered that the operation of Magic Circuits changed the
        temperature of the practitioner, Kiritsugu had studied and trained so
        much that he was now able to read, through the thermal output, the
        current status of the Magic Circuits by viewing the heat distribution.
        Viewing the clear difference between an ordinary person and a magus, it
        is possible to seize an opportunity after the release of prana. The
        joint use of both bulky night vision devices is not just for night time
        battle, but also a configuration to specifically face against a magus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite the steady progress on miniaturization, year after year, of the
        non-magical innovations, a night vision device roughly remains at the
        size of a plastic bottle, and is too bulky to be compared to regular
        optic devices. On top of the rash, compact design of the gun barrel, the
        enormous pair of scopes gives a clumsy air of unbalance. The total
        weight of the gun exceeds 10 kilos. It is already a weapon worthy for a
        support fire squad more than a sniping weapon. The main equipment was
        already hindering practical use, but that was a challenge Kiritsugu had
        calculated at best.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When compared to magecraft, this night-vision sniping gun certainly
        falls behind. Magecraft can let you see better through the dark, and it
        is also possible to detect the position of an enemy magus. But with this
        gun, Kiritsugu is able to shoot down a target without releasing any
        prana.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the dark, unable to detect any prana, the possibility of being hit
        from several hundred meters away― it is a situation a pro soldier
        wouldn't count as incomprehensible, but a lot of magi are really novices
        in such conditions. In fact, a self-conscious magus who has stepped into
        a world of mysteries beyond human intellect cannot relate to the
        stereotypes of a narrower world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu picked up the super heavyweight class sniper gun from the bed,
        checked the smoothness of the breechblock and the weight of the trigger,
        and made sure it was in the best condition.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There is no correction up to 500 meters. Do you want to check it?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"No, it's fine."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He would have wanted to not only check the alignement, but also get a
        grasp of the shooting, but with the constitutional government of Japan,
        that was unfortunately not easy. With the Grail War hostilities having
        already started, he might have to use the gun this very night. Kiritsugu
        fully trusts Maiya's preparations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The other rifle that was prepared, in addition to the Walther sniping
        gun, is for Maiya who will be acting as a vanguard scout, a Steyr AUG
        assault gun. Its night vision scope has also been replaced, like
        Kiritsugu's, and surprisingly, the weight is under 5 kg.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, a Calico M950 submachine gun is ready as a reserve side
        arm. The compact size is not different from a large handgun, and the
        reinforced plastic makes it look more like a toy than the Walther
        sniping gun; but the unique magazine with a system called helical allows
        for 50 Parabellum rounds, with a firing rate of 700 shots per minute for
        a brutal armament.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The rest includes personal hand grenades and stun grenades, smoke
        grenades, and C2 plastic explosive. Following the instructions Kiritsugu
        sent from the north, Maiya had arranged to prepare the equipment without
        allowing any leak. But Kiritsugu's expressionless eyes don't look
        satisfied yet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"And the one I entrusted to you?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... It is here."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya reverentially pulled a rosewood case with both hands from the
        bottom of the closet. It seems that this reverence has somehow stiffened
        even further the beautiful face that never smiles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Taking the case, Kiritsugu placed it on the side table, unfastening the
        clasps and opening the lid with an expert hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The armament on the bed is all brand new weapons for this day. The
        assets of the Einsbern family certainly allow the funds and connection
        necessary to arrange the gathering of brand new, sharp equipment despite
        its exorbitant cost with much difficulty.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But inside that rosewood case, the handgun sleeping in a long silence
        isn't something money can buy. This is the weapon Kiritsugu has favored
        on a lot of battlefields, which he has entrusted to Maiya when he
        retired 9 years ago, unique in the world, a weapon for Kiritsugu's use
        only.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The high-tech equipment that can be obtained with money is an armament
        for Emiya Kiritsugu as the 'Magus Killer'. But there also existed a
        weapon for the 'magus' Emiya Kiritsugu. That is, a 'Mystic Code'― a
        weapon through which a magus can use magecraft in battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thompson Center's Contender. A grip and fore end carved in walnut, a gun
        barrel 14 inch long, reminiscent of a dagger in its scabbard. The
        handgun parts are only the trigger and the percussion hammer, then the
        cylinder and slide cannot be found on the simple exterior, which makes
        it close to a percussion pistol from the last hours of the Middle Ages.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Actually, the Contender is a single shot pistol with a break-open
        cartridge chamber. This gun is essentially a pistol for target shooting
        sport; but Kiritsugu's gun barrel has been switched to make use of the
        hunting specifications of the large caliber, and furthermore, it has
        been magically modified to make use of "magic bullets" for rifling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The bullets used are .30-06 Springfield. A cartridge with a bottleneck
        structure, its size and power level are already different from those of
        a handgun bullet. The .30-06 is 10% stronger than the .308 Winchester
        bullet, and even surpasses the hand canon class of a Magnum bullet.
        Discharged from a handgun, it would have extreme firepower.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But the true menace of this gun is not the destructive power of physical
        explosives and warheads.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The special bullets installed along with the gun in the case― in the
        core of the twelve remaining shots are sealed powdered bones from
        Kiritsugu himself. When Kiritsugu's prana is fired, these "magical
        bullets" forces into the target the 'origin' of the magus named
        Kiritsugu. So to speak, one could call it an imitation of a conceptual
        weapon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Technology becomes the blind spot of magi who stick to magecraft... In
        the end, this is only a tendency, and doesn't reverse the generality.
        Indeed, a lot of magi in the world can be defeated with means like a
        night vision and a heat sensor scope. Nevertheless, there are exceptions
        that cannot be measured with rules and experience. The generality
        against a magus is that there aren't many magi who deviate even further
        from that generality. Kiritsugu calls these opponents "formidable
        enemies".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Against a "formidable enemy" for who artifice won't work― Kiritsugu, as
        a single magus, must stand up when he runs out of secrets. At that time,
        this Contender becomes Kiritsugu's most powerful fang.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rewinding the clock in his heart, Kiritsugu picked the Contender from
        the case. In the past, the walnut gun had absorbed the transpiration of
        Kiritsugu's hand countless times, and after a blank of 9 years, it still
        fit perfectly into his hand and fingers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Whether it's the hand gripping the handle, or the handle gripping the
        hand, that is an indistinct feeling. With just a little strength in the
        fingers, the gun might just fuse with the bones of his hand, and become
        an extension of his arm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Cautiously pulling the spool with his index finger, the chamber lock is
        released and collapses soundly. Sliding a bullet from the same case into
        the opened chamber, he then closes the barrel again with a snap of his
        wrist. With the added ammunition, the overall weight is now 2.6 kg.
        Kiritsugu's right hand gives a familiar response.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the old feeling, Kiritsugu's chest hurt when he thought that he got
        too used to the touch of a dangerous weapon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the end, will his hand remember so perfectly the touch of his wife
        and daughter?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Their tender cheeks, their slender fingers, how much of it will
        Kiritsugu remember?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Picking another bullet from the case, Kiritsugu replayed the reloading
        process that had dyed his hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Pulling the rim of the exposed cartridge with his fingertips from the
        opened chamber, he slides in a second bullet, and immediately slams the
        gun barrel close―
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It took him two seconds. Bad thoughts dull his manipulations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... I've gotten rusty."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Yes."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To Kiritsugu, murmuring in self-derision, Maiya nodded without
        consideration. She knew the old skills of her partner. Kiritsugu pulled
        the bullet he had loaded in the gun, picked the other one he had dropped
        on the floor, and placed everything back in the case with the Contender.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ilya's body is even lighter than the Walther here. And she's already 8
        years old..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Letting free his shameful memories on his own, Kiritsugu started
        loosening alone. Maiya's movement, barging in behind his back, stopped
        his train of thoughts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Agile like a snake, her hand rolled around Kiritsugu's neck, seizing the
        back of his head, blocking his movements, and his mouth― she took his
        soft, dried lips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The taste and touch of a different woman from the one in his heart.
        Breaking off the man's homesickness, but that was too quick to be
        forgiven.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Please only focus of what's necessary for now. Don't think of what
        you don't need."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a blurred voice that had traces of her usage of her tongue left,
        Maiya quietly commanded Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without a word, Kiritsugu felt the sensation in his chest calm down. In
        his heart cooling off, the pain is already vanishing away in a mist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is the woman she is. She is the woman into whom Kiritsugu himself
        has raised a girl once found on a battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A supporting machine whose actions are even more akin to a machine than
        those of the machine called Emiya Kiritsugu. This is Hisau Maiya. An
        indispensable final weapon for Kiritsugu to win this battle... That is
        none other than that woman.
