      <p class="calibre3">
        In the world of magecraft, the ‘miracle’ that can fulfil any wish
        exists.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This vessel is called the Holy Grail, and in order to complete it all
        the rituals need to be conducted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although up till now examples demonstrating its ‘mystery’ have yet to be
        seen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But ever since the Holy Grail was born, countless days and lives have
        already wafted away before it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Not to mention it’s only been two hundred years.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Fuyuki’s ritual is still quite young. For the ritual’s success, many
        talented individuals are needed to build the foundations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, seven magi and seven Servants gathered here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The summoned ones gathered here are all nobles harnessing truths beyond
        the ordinary.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">If you regard surpassing them as your goal.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, come and prove yourself as the strongest &ndash;

      <p class="calibre3">
        A miracle will only happen on one person, and it’s exactly because of
        this uniqueness that miracles hold such values.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Going ten years back from the time of the game ‘Fate/stay night’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Here, another ‘Fate’ made by Urobuchi Gen lifted its curtains.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is Zero. A Heaven’s Feel that no one’s seen. A story about ‘that
        man’ no one’s ever mentioned. A magnificent prologue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        … Wait, I originally wanted to get some fame with Zero’s brilliance too.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But I gave up when I thought the piece couldn’t be too long.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Urobuchi Gen, a distinguished man of both the sword and the pen, who has
        both a calm and thorough objectivity and elegance in words. The
        swiftness of his sword can overcome the speed of sound. Also his ability
        to control the entire story is of the best quality in the PC game world,
        and has created many outstanding works up till now. He’s already an
        assassin or half-vampire. Should be cannibalism next. His motto is ‘hum,
        this is pretty tasty’. He even thinks of himself as one of the great men
        of the time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Firstly, I’d like to express here my joy at having him adapting my work.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A new Fate painted by his hand. I, as the original author, was more
        deeply moved by its charm than anyone else.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>

        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        So, this book talks about the story of the fourth Heaven’s Feel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The rule in the Fate version Heaven’s Feel is actually rather simple.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        1. A battle royale between seven magi and their Servants, acting as
        familiars.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        2. Servants are materialised in Heroic Spirit form, according to an
        appearance ‘suitable to the era’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        3. Master has three absolute commands of the Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        4. The final survivor wins the right to possess the Holy Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That’s how it’s like. Although there are other details, they are
        branches and leaves whose rules will be established as long as the root
        and trunk of the tree exists. In fact it is very simple and basic.
        Because of that, the kind of story created is completely dependent on
        the creator’s outrageous imagination. It can be a cruel boy-meets-girl,
        or a vigorous tangled battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Fate/stay night belongs to the former. What about Zero?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, I don’t need to talk about Urobuchi Gen’s true nature. It
        will definitely be an utterly confused war of communal slaughter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those readers who thought Fate/stay night “should have more than blood,
        tears and tragic endings”, this is for you! This is the true ‘Heaven’s
        Feel’, with the battle for survival as its essence!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is Emiya Kiritsugu’s other side that was never mentioned until now
        and unknown by others.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is the fourth Heaven’s Feel that’s never been completely described
        until now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Be them the magi on the stage or their Servants; they are all boss level
        characters, and between them a cruel and merciless battle of elimination
        will be conducted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yes. Zero is canon, but at the same time it is another legend different
        from ‘Fate/stay night’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If we have to define it, it’s an extra part spin out of canon story.
        It's a unique leaf of a melody that Urobuchi Gen conducted from a
        completely Fate-ish trunk. Here, you don’t have to consider the content
        of the ‘Fate/stay night’ game. Only move the story according to your
        wishes, let the characters shown portray themselves to the fullest and
        rush towards the ending without regret.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That kind of galloping sentiment. I really want to reminiscent the
        contract interwoven with hope and despair, and wait for the duel between
        Emiya Kiritsugu and ‘that man’ in his destiny at the same time,

      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The marvellous conclusion of the volume one post face is as follows. Let
        me talk about behind-the-scenes stories that everyone’s rather
        interested about.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Why would Zero be written by Urobuchi Gen? That is a long story.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The relationship between Urobuchi Gen and Fate can go back to 2002.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I was writing the Fate Saber route at the time, and was sent into the
        hospital near my house due to illnesses. TYPE-MOON was still doujin at
        the time, and Fate was yet a fledgling draft with four main routes
        including an Ilya route.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Takeuchi, who thought ‘if there’s only Nasu doing the work we’ll never
        finish it’, asked me: “Is there a writer you think as trustworthy who
        can write some stories to be inserted into plot?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With such thoughts, I began to hook Urobuchi Gen with baits such as
        ‘wanna go see a movie together?”. Although I was quite happy with
        Urobuchi’s reply “I’ll definitely do things that interest me”, I still
        told him “Nah, I was just kidding!”. That was because I suddenly
        realised I always gave up on projects by being like this, and I must see
        this one through. Maybe Fate will be the last game that is solely
        written by me. Therefore I decided to do it myself, and gave up on the
        plan of seeking his help.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Later, TYPE-MOON changed from doujin to commercial, therefore ordering
        Urobuchi’s scripts became harder. He was also busy doing other things he
        likes, so the matter of cooperation was put away.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then two years passed. It became the summer of 2004, when Hollow was
        being developed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When we were developing Hollow, which had many assistant writers
        creating the plot together, Takeuchi once again surprised me with his
        words.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “For Eclipse, should we get Urobuchi Gen to write one?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was too surprising. But because my disposition as Urobuchi’s fan was
        too intense, it was too hard for me to speak such a request; it was like
        making a demand to a god. I gave the question to Takeuchi in a
        roundabout way “… Um, if it’s brought up by you, Takeuchi, he might find
        it pretty hard to refuse…”. Therefore, at one time when we were dining
        with Urobuchi, Takeuchi said straightforwardly “Urobuchi-san, I’ve got
        something I want to talk to you about”. That was such a strong direct
        attack!! As ferocious as a spiral upward hook.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yes. Spiral upward hook. I think those knowledgeable readers should know
        about it. Faced with such an attack, this man who often surpassed the
        reader’s imagination only hummed and nodded slightly, and made a clever
        counter move.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah. If so, what about getting me to write about the fourth Heaven’s
        Feel? Something like Fate/zero.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">So… impressive!!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Isn’t this just great? To be honest, I even think this is an idea more
        wonderful that developing the Hollow game.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Then, we began to discuss about it:</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Speaking of, what is the fourth war about?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hum &ndash; Saber getting bullied by Gilgamesh and Alexander!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">I answered unceremoniously.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In my mind, there are two main points in the fourth Heaven’s Feel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">One is Saber’s setback.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        King Arthur, who ruled her people as the model human. The selfless and
        devoted, just and uncorrupted Arturia.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The absolute commander who surpassed mortals, the majestic Gilgamesh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And the extravert king whom some called a tyrant, but still held his
        belief that he’ll bring his people to happiness. The King of Conquerors,
        Alexander, who ruled the world as a man.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Using the intensive conflict between the three to unravel Saber’s story
        in Zero.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And the other point is Kiritsugu’s story. I contracted that to him
        according to his wishes as well. I don’t care about other things
        anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I understand. Then I’ll do it according to the way I like it to be. Ah,
        but I’ll do my best to get the style of the piece close to Fate.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He is indeed Urobuchi Gen, able to think about TYPE-MOON’s clients.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Afterwards, we discussed it over and over. After a few continuous
        meet-ups, the draft of volume one was finally completely in the winter
        of 2004.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some readers might be surprised that at the time, Hollow was obviously
        not finished, so why was volume one concluded!?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Because we were too busy at that time. In 2005 we also began to do a
        lot of new commercialisation. Afterwards, as we sorted out all the
        personnel the company got back on track again.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of that, Urobuchi-san thought ‘Zero is a story based on Fate. So
        it’s better if Zero doesn’t become available to the public before Fate
        is released.’ Therefore, after waiting for a year, it was finally
        released in the winter of 2006. That’s how things went.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The above is Urobuchi-san and Zero’s initial encounter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although only us creators thought it will be an interesting project at
        the time, today when the story is approaching its conclusion I have no
        doubt Zero will become a piece that everyone who likes Fate are eagerly
        expecting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Volume one is the prologue. Then it is the beginning of the war in
        volume two and the pitched battle and its astonishments in volume three.
        Lastly, there is the utterly despairing volume four (currently being
        written). Please enjoy the joy of Fate that Urobuchi is bringing to us
        all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oh, no. Maybe Urobuchi’s Heaven’s Feel is indeed the true Hell.
