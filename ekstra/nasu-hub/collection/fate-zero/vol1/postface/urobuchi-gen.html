      <p class="calibre3">
        Urobuchi Gen wants to write stories that can warm people's hearts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those who knew about my creative history would probably furrow their
        brows and think this is a cold joke. Actually, I couldn't completely
        believe it, either. Because when I start typing out words on the
        keyboard, the stories my brain comes up with are always full of madness
        and despair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In fact, I wasn't like this before. I've often written pieces that
        didn't have a perfect ending, but by the last chapter the protagonist
        would still possess a belief that 'Although there will be many hardships
        to come, I still have to hold on'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But from I don't know when, I can no longer write works like this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I am full of hatred towards men's so-called happiness, and had to push
        the characters I poured my heart out to create into the abyss of
        tragedy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For all things in the world, if we just leave them alone and pay them no
        attention, they are bound to advance in a negative direction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just like no matter what we do we can't stop the universe from getting
        colder. It is only a world that is created through a compilation of
        'progresses of common sense'; it can never escape the bondage of its
        physical laws.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, in order to write a perfect ending for a story you have to
        twist the laws of cause and effect, reverse black and white, and even
        possess a power to move in the opposite direction from the rule of the
        universe. Only a heavenly and chaste soul that can sing carols of praise
        towards humanity can save the story. To write a story with a perfect
        ending is a double challenge to the author's body and soul.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Urobuchi Gen had lost that power. It still hasn't recovered. The
        'tragedy syndrome' is still continuing within me. Is this a terminal
        disease? Should I give up on the pure 'warrior of love' that I've longed
        for? Ascend a pallid battle steed and reincarnate into a dispenser of
        this virus... Could it be that I can only create pieces that give men
        courage and hope in my next life? (When I wrote this, I wrote 'courage'
        as 'lingering ghosts'. Could this be because of using 'ime' - Ah, I
        wrote 'ime' as 'hatred' -are there no chances of recovery for me?)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Honestly, I even wanted to break my pen. I remember watching Spidermen
        II. When I saw Peter wishing that he doesn't have the power to change
        his body, I also thought 'Perhaps, I wish to never write another script
        again!'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, I visited my friend Nasu Kinoko's house on the afternoon of
        the next day, and wanted to tell him my true intention. But before I
        spoke with him about what I've been thinking in my heart, Takashi
        Takeuchi got ahead of me and started talking. And as soon as he spoke he
        brought up an unthought-of proposal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The parts afterwards are the same as Kinoko's notes. Although the
        initial plan was just a short piece describing the duel between
        Kiritsugu and Kirei, the wings of imagination can't be stopped once it
        is spread opened and finally all seven Masters and their Servants are
        gathered together. I found myself once again immersed in the joy of
        weaving together a story. It can be said that the launch of Fate/zero
        saved my writing career.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, I've writing a piece that is saved and has a perfect ending.
        To be more accurate, writing a part of this piece.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yes. This marvellous piece called Fate - its perfect united ending
        surrounding the protagonist Emiya Shirō is a set fact. No matter how
        cruel the end of Zero turns out to be, it wouldn't affect the perfect
        finish of this entire work.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, I've finally got a chance to write a tragic ending according
        to my heart's desire. No matter how I display the darkness inside my
        heart, from an overall look I am nevertheless a partner of 'the warrior
        of love, Nasu Kinoko'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ohhh yeah.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Umm. Although it didn't completely solve my problem, however, to allow
        me to once again discover 'the self that has the joy of creation' is
        already a big improvement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, I'm moving forward step by step. No matter where I end up in
        the future, I am already very happy at the moment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to current projections, Fate/zero should end in four volumes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At its end, the readers who witness Saber whimpering, will be so
        overwhelmed by anger and sadness that they will rip the last volume and
        go impulsively reinstall "Fate/stay night" and then they won’t be able
        to stop until they watch as Saber gains her salvation. That’s the
        conclusion I want to write.
