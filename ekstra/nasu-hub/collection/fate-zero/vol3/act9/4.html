        When it comes to the essential factors of a knight, the first to come to
        mind should be the sword and the armor, and the other vital one which
        does not fall behind those armors, is horse-riding.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Straddled on top of the saddle, controlling the reins and gallop on the
        battlefield at will- that is the expected appearance of a knight. This
        isn’t limited to horses; other quadruped animals, chariots, or even

        would suffice. This mobility which far surpassed walking and the
        exhilaration coming from such freedom is indeed the essential joy
        connecting together all such ‘riding’ abilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Saber, who had fought her entire life as the King of Knights, the
        very act of ‘riding’ is something had already rooted its existence in
        the depth of her soul. The ‘Riding’ ability that she possesses when
        materializing as a Servant is perhaps the true reflection of this
        characteristic of hers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is really marvelous &ndash; Saber remarked in her heart as she
        gently caressed the steering wheel of the Mercedes-Benz 300L.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The feeling of controlling this mechanical contraption is completely
        different from that of riding a stallion, but after only one experience
        she had discovered that this intricate mechanical contraption gave off
        the delusion that it is alive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While it is obvious that mechanical gears have no blood or soul, it
        still loyally moved forward rapidly and sturdily according to the will
        of Saber, its driver. This deference the Mercedes displayed was like
        riding her own beloved stead, and it filled her with trust and
        satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“No wonder Irisviel is so ecstatic about driving.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As she realized this, a small question also invaded her thoughts &ndash;
        <i class="calibre5"
          >since driving this car is so pleasant, then why did Irisviel pass the
          chance of driving to me this time?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“How does it feel to be driving, Saber?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel, sitting next to her, asked with satisfied smiles all over her
        face. It was a satisfied expression of a mother who had brought a new
        toy to her child and looked on as the child played.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It’s truly an amazing riding being. If this thing appeared in my era,
        it would definitely be something unimaginable.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber smiled and replied frankly, at the same time chasing doubt out of
        her heart. Irisviel must have believed that Saber would feel happy with
        driving and then proceeded to pass the chance of driving to her.
        Perhaps, it was a kind of a reward for her loyalty as a knight. If so,
        then Saber should also return this gesture as a knight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But a Servant’s ability is pretty awesome too. Although it’s the first
        time you are controlling a machine, the level of your skills can truly
        be regarded as first-rate.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I’ve got some strange feelings too, more or less &ndash; a feeling as
        if I possess this skill I was made to master long time ago. Rather than
        understanding it with reasoning, I just remembered the controls of the
        next steps naturally.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel hummed for a while, then suddenly a mischievous smile emerged
        on her face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I’ve suddenly got an idea. We should go to the world’s black market and
        buy something like the latest tank or bomber; if you get in and drive
        it, then wouldn't you finish this entire Heaven's Feel with one blow?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although she knew Irisviel was joking, Saber gave an amazed and bitter
        smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Although your idea is interesting, I can declare this &ndash; there are
        no weapons in any era that can defeat my sword.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While Saber’s words seemed over-confident, Irisviel did not beg to
        differ. Anyone who had fought together with this Servant would testify
        the truth of her words with their own eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Speaking of that, Maiya is getting deeper and deeper into Fuyuki city
        &ndash;”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber said in a low voice as she looked at the small truck that Hisau
        Maiya drove in front of them, which served as the forerunner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Is it really alright? Is this house, which is going to be the
        new headquarters, too close to the center of the battlefield?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “That is not something worth worrying about. Both the Tōsaka and Matō
        families openly built their defenses in the city. Other foreign Masters
        also resided within in the city without any qualms; it’s the Einsbern
        family who built their dwelling so far away that appear to be the odd
        ones.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For the Heaven’s Feel, which on broad principles demanded battles to be
        secret, the location of the headquarters didn’t have any special
        meaning. The so-called ‘advantages of the terrain’ is just referring to
        those elements of the leylines that had to do with magecrafts concerning
        spirituality.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Also, considering this in terms of concealment, maybe this new place
        Kiritsugu chose is even more reliable than the previous castle.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It seems Saber herself didn’t notice it, but her face was briefly
        clouded with a dark shade when Kiritsugu’s name was mentioned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre5">Not surprising</i>, Irisviel had already given up in
        her heart. That's because the strife between the two was already
        predicted from the start. Irisviel's current position was to cover up
        for that. If that happens, she would have no choice but to think more of
        it in accordance to her reputation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The strange combination of light van and classical sports car finally
        crossed the Fuyuki Bridge and entered Miyama. The scenery around them
        changed completely when they exited Shinto, a gentle and quite style,
        simple and carrying with it a historical weight, filled their
        surroundings. Despite being plain, the quiet row of houses makes one
        feel its history.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This place really is too close to Tōsaka and Matō’s headquarters. He
        definitely chose a place no one would expect.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It’s said that the most dangerous place is also the safest. In terms of
        unpredictability, Kiritsugu’s choice is definitely correct.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it was a comment of agreement, Saber voice still sounded
        somewhat stiff. Saber thinks Kiritsugu’s theories are appreciable in
        terms of strategies; what she could not endure was the coldness and
        cruelty of Kiritsugu’s tactics.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya, slightly ahead, gradually slowed the speed of the light van and
        parked on the side of the road. It looks like they’ve already arrived at
        their destination.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Here?... Fuuh. Another really mysterious building, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Stepping off the Mercedes which was following behind the light van,
        Irisviel’s first words were full of emotion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A Japanese building that was full of classical elegance as if it was a
        stage set from a period drama. Even in Miyama, where the passage of time
        seemed unperceivable, this building should still be counted as one of an
        extremely rare style. Moreover, considering the large area this wooden
        structure took, it is an extremely rare example even in the
        architectural history of modern Japan.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the feeling of desolation emanating from this building was also
        extraordinary. It looks like it’s been lying unused for a long time.
        This place must have some history behind it as it pointlessly occupied
        such a large space in civic planning and wasn't torn down, while
        remained without human occupation and yet bore signs of frequent
        reparation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “From today onwards, both of you would use here as your headquarters.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya, getting off the small truck, handed Irisviel a string of keys as
        she said those words with a matter-of-fact tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ah, just give this to Saber.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“ &ndash; Understood, Irisviel.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since her master ordered her to keep the keys to the rooms, Saber took
        the key ring from Maiya’s hand without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were many keys on the key ring. Apart from the keys for the main
        door and the porch, other keys for the back door and other rooms should
        also have been included. The shapes of the majority of the keys are the
        normal cylindrical kind; only one was cast in an ancient style.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Maiya, what’s this key for? It’s very different from the other ones.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It’s the key for the storehouse in the courtyard. Although it looks
        very old, I’ve checked that the lock has no problems.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After answering thus, as if she realized the condition of that building
        again, Maiya's cold face clouded just a little.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This house was bought only a few days ago. I’m very sorry, but as you
        can see, there isn't any preparation at all. Maybe the inside isn’t
        really suitable for people to live in…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I don't mind. For the time being, I won’t complain as long as it can
        block out the wind and the rain.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it didn’t sound like something a high-born lady would say, the
        Einsbern castle in the wildness wasn’t any better in terms of
        dilapidation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; If so, then I’ll be taking my leave.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maybe Kiritsugu gave her some other duties as well; Maiya quickly
        returned to the light van after she excused herself and briskly
        departed, leaving Irisviel and Saber who were still standing in front of
        the empty house.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Then, Saber, let’s start checking out this new home.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Alright…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After opening the lock of the door, as they thought, a run-down front
        yard without any maintenance for a long time, appeared. The courtyard
        was full of waist-high grass and the main house, immersed in weeds, gave
        out a feeling of unease.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Is this is what people call a haunted house?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel seemed like she didn’t care at about this desolate and
        abandoned house at all, and instead looked around cheerfully, like a bad
        child anticipating a haunted house in a theme park. Seeing her childish
        face in high spirits, Saber didn’t even know what emotion she should
        respond with.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Huh? What’s wrong, Saber?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Nothing. If you don’t mind it, then it’s good.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Saber who had been through countless battles, this is already
        something she’s used to, so there wasn’t much that displeased her with
        this abandoned house’s dilapidation. If Irisviel can also accept this,
        then there’s nothing inappropriate about using here as the new
        headquarters.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The inside must have a wooden corridor, and tatami, and paper-panelled
        sliding doors. Ohoho, I once said I wanted to see what old Japanese
        houses are like with my own eyes, and Kiritsugu definitely remembered
        that and did this in purpose.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        How could that cold, cruel, emotionless man, who was like a fighting
        machine, think about sentimental matters like this on the battlefield?
        Although Saber didn’t agree with Irisviel’s words, she didn’t say
        anything when she saw how happy Irisviel was.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just like this, finished checking all the inner rooms while sneezing
        continuously due to the piles of dust she had to face, Irisviel finally
        wore a serious expression and began to contemplate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Is this far from your expectations?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hmm. I’m already satisfied with this &ndash; it’s a bit difficult for
        this to function as the headquarters of a magus.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite Irisviel’s weak appearance, she was in fact a first-rate magus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Although it wouldn’t be problematic to set up a bounded field around
        here, when it comes to setting up a workshop… but this is the tradition
        of this country so there’s nothing I can do. The prana can easily drift
        away in a house with such an open structure, especially for the Einsbern
        craft… Aaa, this is frustrating. If possible, I want a room sealed off
        with stone and earth…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber, suddenly remembering something, spoke as she took out the last
        key that they haven’t used yet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Didn’t Maiya say that there’s a storeroom in the courtyard? Shall we
        check that out?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; Aha, this place is ideal.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel nodded and spoke with satisfaction as soon as she stepped into
        the storeroom’s door.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Although it’s a bit cramped, I can practice the craft in here just like
        how I did in the castle. After all, as long as a magic circle is
        established, I can solidify my territory.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maybe Kiritsugu thought about this at the start, and specifically found
        this spot with a storeroom. After all, a traditional Japanese building
        like this with a storeroom attached is very hard to find.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Then, let’s start preparing now. Saber, can you please get the material
        we put in the car?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Right, shall I get all of them?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “For now, just take the chemicals and equipments for alchemy. Hmm, let
        me think… right, also take the red and silver makeup boxes too.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“As you command.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber carefully took out a particularly light luggage from the trunk of
        the Mercedes. Although it was Maiya who was responsible for packing the
        luggage, Saber had some idea about what’s in it as well.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When Saber brought the makeup box, Irisviel seemed to have already
        decided on the location she wanted to create the magic circle at, and
        said to Saber while pointing at one corner of the storeroom.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Then, I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble you, Saber. Draw two hexagrams
        overlapping each other on that spot, with a radius of six inches and
        facing this direction.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“ &ndash; Understood.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber also knew a bit about basic magecraft, so she could easily
        complete Irisviel’s demands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite knowing the meaning of the instructions, she wasn’t clear on why
        Irisviel wanted her to do so.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Then can you please mix some mercury for me? Strictly obey the ratios I
        tell you, and prudently &ndash; “
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Irisviel, I’ve got a question.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finally, Saber couldn’t bear it anymore, and spoke the question she’s
        kept hidden in her heart since this morning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “ &ndash; You seem to be trying your best to avoid touching anything at
        all today; is it just me?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It’s like that for driving the car, or taking the keys… maybe such
        things can afford to be ignored, but you won’t use your hands even for
        the all-important magic circle; there must be some reasons behind it.
        Please correct me if I’m wrong, but is there something inconveniencing
        you today?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel appeared like she’s having difficulties in talking about this,
        and glanced around. Saber kept asking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If you aren’t feeling well you should tell me beforehand. After all,
        I’m responsible for your safety, and I need to be prepared for such
        things.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… Sorry. However, I really didn’t hide anything from you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel sighed helplessly, then turned towards Saber and stretched out
        her hand as she spoke.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Saber, now I’m going to squeeze your hand the hardest I can, is it
        alright?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Aye? Sure.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although she didn’t know the reason, Saber stretched out her hand to
        hold Irisiviel’s. Those fingers that were too beautiful and fine for
        humans softly took hold of Saber’s hand &ndash; then, they shook
        extremely gently for just once, and Saber couldn’t even feel any
        pressure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Irisviel?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I’m not joking. I did the hardest I could just now.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Irisviel made a forced smile and spoke.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Just opening my fingers takes all my strength away, and it’s impossible
        to hold or grab anything, not to mention driving a car. Just changing my
        clothes this morning exhausted me.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Wha, what on earth is going on? Are you hurt anywhere?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber asked, shocked, but Irisviel just shrugged her shoulders as if it
        didn’t matter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I just didn’t feel well, so I shut off the sensation of touch. Although
        sealing off one of the sensations would suppress my spirituality in a
        large degree, it doesn’t have a big influence on other activities. This
        accommodating convenience must also be one of the advantageous points
        about being a homunculus.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It’s not so simple, is it?! Don’t force yourself when you aren’t well.
        You should see a doctor.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Don’t worry, Saber. Did you forget? I’m not an ordinary human. Even if
        I catch a cold, I can’t see a doctor &ndash; this kind of discomfort is
        only a blemish in my construction. It doesn’t matter; you don’t need to
        worry too much for now, I’ll adjust it properly myself.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although she couldn’t completely comprehend it, she knew if she kept
        inquiring about this then the fact that Irisviel is a ‘manufactured’
        homunculus would be laid bare in front of her eyes. Therefore, Saber had
        to stop herself. It was because she knew very well that what Irisviel
        was most proud of was the fact that she ‘isn’t merely a manufactured
        doll’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Aaah, then I really have to trouble you, Saber. Things like the ones
        today, driving the car and creating the magic circle, would all need
        your help, my lord knight.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; These are what I should be doing. It’s me who asked questions
        that shouldn’t be asked, I’m sorry.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Alright alright. Then, let’s hurry and make the magic circle. As long
        as I can rest properly in a magic circle connected to the leylines, my
        situation would improve.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “As you command. Then, please repeat the steps of the construction.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, the duo began the creation of the temporary workshop in the
        storeroom. Saber concentrated on the creation of the magic circle of the
        Einsbern craft after she refined the mercury according to Irisviel’s
        instructions. Like two harmonious sisters, the two of them busied
        themselves together in the storeroom, surrounded by a happy atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But Saber would never have imagined that this happy time she spent with
        Irisviel in this storeroom and their smiles would be the final beautiful
        memories about this noble princess that she would hold.
