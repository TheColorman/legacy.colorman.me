      <p class="calibre3">Ashes &ndash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">And a tragic scene to go with it.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It had been thoroughly ruined, to the point where one could not begin to
        tell what the perpetrator had intended to destroy. It was as though a
        storm had raged through and wrecked the workshop, leaving nothing to
        remind a viewer of its former appearance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was no storm, of course, but deliberate destruction. After all, how
        could a storm wash over this place, in an underground water tank? The
        carnage wrought on Caster’s workshop could only have been caused by the
        power of an anti-army or perhaps an anti-fortress Noble Phantasm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Oh God… this is too much!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Uryū Ryūnosuke could do nothing more than weep and wail in despair as he
        looked upon the scene of this tragedy. An onlooker might have been moved
        to sympathy upon seeing his pitiful, agonized form… that is, if they
        knew nothing of him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke and Caster had been busy hunting down fresh meat the whole of
        last night. But when they returned to their workshop, flushed with joy,
        they were greeted by this scene of utter devastation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The art pieces we worked so hard to create… it’s too much! How can
        humans do this kind of thing?!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke’s shoulders shook as he sobbed. Caster gently gathered him
        into his comforting embrace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ryūnosuke, you still haven’t seen the true evil lurking in the hearts
        of men, so your grief is understandable… what you need to realize is
        that only a small amount of people can truly comprehend beauty and
        harmony. The others, the rest of the rabble, will only react with
        bestial jealousy when they are exposed to sacred artwork. To them,
        beautiful things are nothing more than targets to be destroyed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Naturally, Caster was also furious at the destruction of his sanctum.
        However, he had no choice but to swallow his anger and calmly accept the
        situation. After all, he had once been the general of a nation’s armies.
        His battle intuitions told him that it would be dangerous to directly
        confront an enemy who could destroy all the demons he had posted as
        sentries and wreck his workshop so thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That Ryūnosuke had not remained in the workshop last night was also a
        blessing of sorts. With that in mind, Caster’s rage slowly mellowed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You need to know that our creations will often be destroyed by these
        rabble… because of that, we cannot be overly sentimental toward our art
        pieces. Everything we make will inevitably be destroyed. Thus, as
        creators, we should take joy in the act of creation.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You mean… it doesn’t matter if what we make is destroyed, because we
        can always create again?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Exactly! Ryūnosuke, that sharp understanding of yours is definitely the
        best thing about you!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing that, Ryūnosuke brushed the tears from the corner of his eyes as
        Caster laughed heartily. He sighed deeply as he looked around his
        surroundings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Is this God’s punishment because we pursued our happiness too much?” he
        mumbled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster’s attitude suddenly changed as he heard Ryūnosuke’s words. He
        firmly gripped Ryūnosuke’s shoulders, turning him so they were face to
        face. A sharp glint flickered in his eyes as he looked at Ryūnosuke’s
        expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I’ll only say this once, Ryunosuke… God does not punish humans. God
        only plays with humans.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bluebeard’s eyes burned with emotion, but his face was blank. It was
        almost as though he was a different person, compared to the tense mood
        he had had earlier.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“S-sir?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Once upon a time, I committed blackest sacrilege, the most vile, the
        most foul thing a man could ever do. Ryūnosuke, the sins you have
        commited are nothing more than child’s play in comparison. But no matter
        how many I killed, no matter how sinful I became, no punishment from God
        descended on me. By the time I had noticed, I had walked down the road
        to Hell for eight years. The harrowing screams and the mournful wails of
        thousands of children were lost in the nihilistic darkness!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>

          preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"
          version="1.1"

      <p class="calibre3">
        “In the end I was not eliminated by God, but by men who had endless
        desires, like me. The Church and King decided that I was guilty,
        captured and executed me. But all they wanted was my wealth and my land;
        they simply drew me into a trap to make those things their own. That was
        not punishment for my sins! That was nothing more than blatant robbery!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that moment, Ryūnosuke realized that he’d struck a nerve in this
        monster &ndash; but Uryū Ryūnosuke did not feel fear. Instead, he felt a
        loneliness and anguish that seemed to have no end. Compared to his prior
        glibness, the current expression on Caster’s face, as though he had lost
        everything important to him, made Ryūnosuke acutely aware of the sorrow
        that this great madman concealed in the depths of his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“But Sir, even so… God still exists, right?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Listening to Ryūnosuke’s soft murmur, Caster couldn’t help but hold his
        breath and carefully examine the expression of his common yet strangely
        noble Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…why, Ryūnosuke? You have no religion and know nothing of miracles. Why
        would you think so?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ”Because it seemed as though this world was a boring place, so I kept
        searching. But the more I looked, the more interesting and unusual
        things I found.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke opened his arms as he spoke, as though he were embracing
        everything in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I’ve thought about this for a long time. This world is full of so many
        pleasures. It’s far too much luxury for an individual. If we simply
        change the way we look at things, we’ll discover that there are endless
        foreshadowings in here. In the search for true happiness, there must be
        no greater excitement than defeating the world. Somebody must be writing
        this, the world’s script. Someone must be writing this long novel with
        almost five billion characters… perhaps, this author is what we call
        God.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster blinked silently, staring blankly into the emptiness as though he
        were contemplating Ryūnosuke’s words. After a while, he once again
        looked at his Master, and asked in a low, solemn voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “- then, Ryūnosuke, do you honestly think that God loves men?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The serial killer answered cheerfully, “Of course. It’s a love from the
        depths of his heart. A God who is able to keep writing this world’s
        script for tens of thousands of years without stopping must love men
        very much. Hmm… I think God must be doing His best with His writing,
        while being immersed in the joy of creating His work at the same time.
        He is touched by the love and courage in His work, shedding tears at the
        sad parts, and also shocked and terrified by the horror and despair
        within…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke paused, as though to review what he’d already said, and then
        he continued.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “God enjoys the courage and hope of mankind, but he also likes the
        sorrow and despair of bloodshed. Otherwise… the hymn of life would lack
        its vivid color. Therefore, Sir, this world must be full of God’s love.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like a devoted believer praying before a holy painting, Caster listened
        to Ryūnosuke’s words with quiet solemnity. Then, he slowly lifted his
        head, his expression one of happiness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “In this modern day, the people have already lost their faith and the
        governments have abandoned God’s creed. Once, I thought this was a world
        near destruction… but I am thoroughly impressed that new followers like
        yourself still appear at times like this. Oh Ryūnosuke, my Master!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah, no, no, I’ll be embarrassed if you say things like this.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he didn’t know why, at least he knew Caster was complimenting
        him. Ryūnosuke coyly deflected it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “However &ndash; from your religious perspective, my sins are tiny in
        comparison.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It is the nature of first-class entertainers to take on unpleasant
        chores to earn smiles, right? Sir, God will surely reward your merciless
        acts by joyfully returning those fools to us.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing what Ryūnosuke said, Bluebeard laughed out loud, seemingly
        pleased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Be it sacrilege or praise! For you, does it all seem to be the worship
        of God? Ah, Ryūnosuke, your thoughts are truly deep and philosophical.
        That God, who plays with the countless humans in the world is nothing
        more than a toy himself &ndash; I see! Then even this bad joke can be
        understood.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After laughing for a while, Caster’s eyes once more bore that forlorn
        look, the same look a man, madly devoted to his art, would have just
        before reaching his frenzied climax.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Very well. Then let us use despair and vividly-colored tears to dye
        this divine temple a splendid shade. I will let those in Heaven know
        that they are not the only ones who know what is true entertainment.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Do you have any brilliant ideas again, Sir?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ryūnosuke looked expectantly at Bluebeard, who seemed more excited than
        he had ever been in his life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Since it’s been decided, then let’s have a celebration. Ryūnosuke,
        today’s feast is going to be a bit special; it’s to raise the curtains
        on the new religion you proposed.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Understood. I’ll do all I can to make it as COOL as possible!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That night, Ryūnosuke and Caster had ‘harvested’ five children. These
        children, brought to this unknown, lightless place, were huddled against
        each other, shivering as they watched the crazed performance unfold
        before them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the face of these two crazed worshippers’ new religion, the souls of
        these innocent children would not see even a sliver of salvation’s
        light.
