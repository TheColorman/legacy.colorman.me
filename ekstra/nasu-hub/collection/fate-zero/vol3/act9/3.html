      <p class="calibre3">
        "It looks like your mood today is fairly good. Archer."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As usual as if he was in his own house, the golden-sparkling Servant,
        sitting as he wished in Kotomine Kirei's private room, had for an
        unknown reason worn an unpredictable smile since morning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under normal circumstances, when a person wears a smile he often will
        infect the people around him, easing the surrounding atmosphere, but by
        coincidence Kirei was of a personality that was not the sort to like
        seeing other people smiling; moreover, the smile of the King of Heroes
        in front of him could only be associated with some unsettling things.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Though I have not yet seen the likeness of the Holy Grail&mdash; even
        if the Grail is a worthless trinket, I no longer care. Because I have
        found something else of interest."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oh, truly surprising. Did you not once scoff that this earth has only
        forgery and ugliness?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That has not changed. But, on the other hand I am interested in
        watching, until the end, the final outcome of this Heaven's Feel."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps, the miraculous feast held yesterday night at the Einsbern
        castle's central courtyard had caused some change in Archer's mood. But
        Kirei also saw a part of the process, and now in recollection&mdash;
        could it be because of Rider? Or because of the question-and-answer with
        Saber?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I, as a person, like arrogant opponents. People who are not constrained
        by their own humble strength, and so are ambitious. Every time when
        meeting an opponent like this I will be very happy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at Kirei's puzzled expression, Archer leisurely waved the
        wineglass containing red wine and continued to speak.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But there are two types of haughtiness too. The case in which the
        person has too low a caliber; and the case in which he has too great a
        wish. The former, not unusual one is very foolish, but the latter is of
        a difficult-to-obtain, rare species."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Both are stupid things without any difference, isn't that so?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In comparison to mediocrity, this type of rare foolishness appears even
        more valuable, does it not? Though born human, but yet visionary of
        ideals so great that they are impossible to attain with human strength,
        and so abandon their status as a human to realize this one
        ideal&mdash;no matter how many times I see it I do not grow tired of it,
        the sorrow and despair of this sort of person."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer finished speaking, raising the wineglass as if in celebration,
        then elegantly downed the red wine inside. No matter how he appeared
        bold, this Heroic Spirit was completely unable to leave anyone with an
        impression of even slight avarice. Perhaps this was also his style of
        being a king.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You said that, Kirei, but you appear unusually cheerful today."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Only relieved. I have finally been released from a heavy burden."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Command Seals that had originally been carved on Kirei's right hand
        had disappeared. During the battle last night at the Einsbern castle,
        his Servant-Assassin had been completely eradicated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei had completely forfeited his rights as a Master. Though it looked
        as if there had not been any change, but exactly as he had himself said,
        only now had he truly been released from the responsibilities and
        obligations of being a Master. Kirei's temporary residence at the Church
        could finally be considered completely justified.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Where have the vanished Command Spells gone now? Those existences that
        are after all the physical manifestations of magic, will most likely not
        disappear into thin air just like that, will they?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In theory, they should have returned to the Grail. The Command Seals
        themselves are things that the Grail bestows. People who have lost their
        eligibility as a Master because of the loss of their Servant, their
        Command Seals should be reclaimed back by the Grail. Yet, if there
        appears a Servant whose contract has been lifted because of the loss of
        his Master, the Grail will then redistribute the unused Command Seals it
        had previously reclaimed to new contractors."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Twenty-one engraved Command Seals distributed to seven Masters,
        disappearing after having been used once, and the Command Seals that at
        the end had not been consumed would then be amassed in the hands of the
        supervisor and commissioned for safekeeping.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then in other words, depending on the development of the war, new
        Masters may possibly emerge?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Heroes in front of him should not have such deep interest in
        something unrelated to his own desires.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though he felt that Gilgamesh's question was to some degree somewhat
        abnormal, Kirei still continued to explain further.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Indeed. But to be one of the candidates chosen by the Grail, is not
        something that can be casually decided. So during the search for new
        Masters, the Grail will still prioritize the consideration of those
        people, possible Masters, that had been previously chosen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In particular, the Masters of the '3 families of the beginning' are even
        more special. Even having lost their Servant, as long as in that period
        of time exist other Servants who have not yet formed contracts, they
        can, under a circumstance of not losing Command Seals, continue to
        exercise their authority as a Master. It seems that several similar
        things have happened in the past."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the eyes of Gilgamesh, who had been silently listening to his
        explanation, Kirei perceived an unsettling pressure, and could not help
        but stop.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What is it? Continue explaining, Kirei."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Anyway, this is also one of the reasons a Master who has lost his
        servant in the war will gain the protection of the Church. When there
        appear openings for other Masters, they will have a very great chance of
        once again obtaining 'leftover' Command Seals. Precisely because of
        this, the methods that participants of the Heaven's Feel use against
        enemy Masters are not to cause them to lose their combat effectiveness,
        but to directly kill them. This is also a measure to ensure that there
        will not be trouble from them in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Heh."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gilgamesh, as if extremely happy, sneered, then once again filled the
        glass with wine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then, so to speak&mdash; Kirei, don't you have a very great chance of
        acquiring Command Seals again?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing the words of the King of Heroes, this time Kirei sneered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That is not possible! The purpose of my participation in the Heaven's
        Feel is the same as my mentor Tokiomi said&mdash; to be a support for
        the Tōsaka faction, and now my assignment has completely ended.
        Assassin's investigation has been completely finished, Tokiomi-shi has
        already developed a sure-win strategy against all the Masters and their
        Servants. Now there is completely no need for me to appear again."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I must say, I have great suspicion of this plan of Tokiomi's. That guy
        does not have the ability to obtain the Holy Grail at all."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You truly speak freely of your own Master."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Kirei who sniggered, Gilgamesh directed his crimson red eyes sharply
        at him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Kirei, it seems that you have a great misunderstanding of the
        Master-Servant relationship between me and Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi faces me with the manner of a subject to his king, at the same
        time offering prana as tribute. It is because of this sort of contract
        that I agreed to obey his summon. Do not liken me to the other Servant
        lackeys."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then, how will you deal with the orders of the Command Seals?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't care... if a follower fulfils his obligations as one, then
        occasionally the king will listen to his counsel. That is all."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kirei could not help but smile wryly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Gilgamesh knew the true objective of this Heaven's Feel... his
        contractual relationship with Tokiomi would probably weaken. Of course,
        if it truly reached that time, Tokiomi, possessing Command Seals, would
        certainly acquire an overwhelming advantage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Now is a state of competition for Caster's head. The one who attacks
        last and deals the decisive blow&mdash; Archer, it should be you. Now
        you do not have the time to slowly and leisurely sample wine."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The way Tokiomi dawdles, it will be long before it is time for my
        entrance. During this period of time I can only look for something else
        to do, to kill boredom&mdash; Kirei, did you say just a moment ago that
        Assassin had already completed all his assignments?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ahah, the routine business?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei had once promised Gilgamesh to inform him of the various Masters'
        actions and their motives for wanting to obtain the Holy Grail, for his
        'entertainment'. So to satisfy Gilgamesh's curiosity, Kirei had also
        ordered Assassin to keep watch.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ah, that investigation has also been completed. I should have let
        Assassin personally report yesterday night. This way, the effort of
        explaining it―"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"No, this is good enough."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Suddenly Gilgamesh interrupted Kirei’s words.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I have no interest in that shadow-like guy. Kirei, this sort of thing
        is only meaningful information when you say it.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although suspecting the intention of the totally unfathomable Archer,
        reluctantly, Kirei gave a brief summary of each Master's character.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the intelligence obtained through eavesdropping on the
        conversations between Masters and their Servants and entourages, their
        motive for participating in the Heaven’s Feel could be easily surmised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Master of Lancer and the Master of Rider had no particular wish of
        the Grail, and participated in this war in pursuit of victory only for
        the honor of magi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the Master of Caster, he did not even know what the Holy Grail
        was. He only participated in this Heaven’s Feel in search of even
        greater thrills from killing people.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Master of Berserker seemed to be searching for some ‘redemption’.
        Because he had fled, he had caused the second daughter of the Tōsakas to
        become a sacrifice, and was now returning to request that the hostage be
        released with the conditions of the exchange being that he retrieved the
        Holy Grail. It seemed that he had a history with Tokiomi’s wife Aoi in
        the past. He was the one of the five enemy Masters whose motive was the
        most basely ordinary.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">About Saber's Master ― Kirei had to lie to Archer.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Assassin, up till being accidentally exterminated the previous night,
        had not found any information related to Emiya Kiritsugu. Only that that
        man seemed almost as if he had seen through to that Assassin being
        killed by Archer was a fraud, until the end thoroughly concealing his
        own secrets. It could only be said that to be able to do this under
        surveillance as strict as Assassin was truly worthy of appreciation. In
        comparison with the other Masters only he was a special existence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And, even if Kirei had really discovered Kiritsugu’s true intent, he
        would probably not have reported this to Archer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As it looked now, there were still many points of doubt. But even this,
        did not shake Kirei’s thoughts of crossing swords with Emiya Kiritsugu.
        This was Kirei’s personal problem, unrelated to the Heaven’s Feel, and
        he did not have the slightest intention of allowing outsiders to
        interfere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, Kirei said to Archer, it was the Einsbern family’s stubborn
        wish, participating in this Heaven’s Feel only simply to allow the Holy
        Grail to descend. But Archer seemed to not have seen through to what
        Kirei was thinking in his heart, only barely interestedly listening to
        his report.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&mdash;Hm, to let their hopes be dashed is also not bad entertainment.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After having finished listening to the motives of the other five people,
        Archer said disdainfully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After all, they're only a pile of rubble. Every one of them does not
        have any creative thought processes at all. Thinking of seizing my
        treasure only for some silly reasons… all thieving pests that should be
        executed directly without need for negotiation."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing Archer's unusually arrogant words, Kirei helplessly sighed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of information that required much work to obtain, do you have only
        these thoughts? It looks as if I have suffered for nothing."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What 'suffered for nothing'?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Heroes, a meaningful smile on his face, said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you saying, Kirei? The efforts of you and the Assassins have
        gotten great results, have they not?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if sensing that the other party's words carried an ironic meaning,
        Kirei stared at Archer and said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Are you mocking me? King of Heroes."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You don't understand? Never mind, it is excusable that you do not
        understand. Because you are a man who can only see what he cares about."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Completely ignoring Kirei's keen gaze, Archer languidly continued to
        say.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "&mdash;Guys who have no self-awareness, only simply pursue instinctive
        pleasure. Just like those beasts who chase the scent of blood. This type
        of feeling in their hearts will manifest instinctively in their words
        and actions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, Kirei. When you, through yourself, again recount all that you
        have heard, seen, and understood, you have already amply shown your
        inner thoughts. That which your words describe in greatest detail, is
        also that which you are most interested in.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In other words, observing a person's words and actions, is the best way
        of understanding his interests. Toys like humans, stories like life
        there is truly no more meaningful way of entertainment."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"......"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time Kirei also had to admit, he had truly been careless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had originally thought that this was only the King of Heroes'
        meaningless amusement. But it looked as if his judgment had lapsed; the
        other party was using this method to probe his innermost thoughts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Firstly discount that guy you purposely hid the truth about. This sort
        of subconscious concern is but only a sort of stubbornness. Now what I
        want to talk about is the person you unintentionally noticed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, speaking of this, of the remaining four Masters, who is it then
        that you paid most attention to?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei suddenly felt a strong sense of unease in his heart. At this
        point, it would be best to end this topic as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Regarding Kirei's indecision, Archer seemed to feel satisfied, smilingly
        drinking a mouthful of red wine, then continuing to say.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Master of Berserker. Called what, Kariya? Kirei, your report of
        this man was truly extremely detailed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Because his matters are relatively complicated. So the parts that
        require specific explanation are naturally more numerous. That's all."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hm, I don't think so? That is because you are more concerned about this
        man's matters, so you gave Assassin the order to 'thoroughly investigate
        these complicated matters'. An order you gave under circumstances even
        you were not aware of, purely based on interest."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"......"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing Archer's argument which did not permit rebuttal, Kirei began to
        review his own actions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Matō Kariya... he had indeed believed this was a character that required
        especial attention. Not only did this person bear a strong hatred for
        Tokiomi, Berserker as his Servant also had the mysterious ability of
        being able to seize others' Noble Phantasms, considerably the
        arch-nemesis of Archer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But in consideration of threat level&mdash; Kariya and Berserker would
        definitely not be first in line.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Master and Mad Enhanced Servant, hastily prepared, that came forth
        to the war. They will probably be, of these five enemy groups, the
        quickest to be eradicated. There was not even need for use of some
        scheme; merely dragging out the battle into a protracted war would be
        enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As long as let be, he would be his own death. So to some extent, he
        should probably be considered an opponent extremely easily dealt with.
        Against such an opponent, still investigating the situation thus
        detailedly&mdash;&mdash;taking a step back, it truly appeared somewhat
        insensible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... I admit it, this was a lapse in my judgment."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With the humility of a clergyman acquired from long years of
        self-cultivation, Kirei nodded and said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Indeed, after thinking about it carefully, Matō Kariya is but a
        short-lived and thus weak enemy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From a long-term perspective, he cannot become a threat, is not worthy
        of attention. I have given him too high an appraisal, and only thus have
        to Archer&mdash; you, explained too much."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Heh, is that it?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though Kirei had made allowances, Archer's glittering scarlet eyes,
        still had an unfathomable expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But Kirei, now let us suppose&mdash; in the event of miracle
        interweaving with luck, Berserker and his Master survived unto the end
        and furthermore obtained the Holy Grail. What will happen at that time,
        have you thought about it?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the event of, that is, assuming something completely unreal...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ultimate end of what Matō Kariya seeks is only the showdown with
        Tōsaka Tokiomi. Not considering his chances of winning, in the event
        that he was in the end victorious over Tokiomi and furthermore obtained
        the Grail&mdash; at that time, what will Kariya face?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ... It did not even require thought; it must be his own darkness.
        Originally for the sake of helping Aoi reclaim her daughter, but now to
        claim the life of Aoi's husband. Of this contradiction he seemed still
        unaware, no, rather than say he is unaware, once might say he is,
        because of the jealousy and selfishness of his heart, intentionally
        deceiving himself, hiding this feeling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When facing that bloodstained victory, Matō Kariya will definitely sink
        into the dilemma of having to face the ugliness of his own heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer, from one side watching Kirei silently thinking, smiled and said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I say, Kirei. Did you realize the true significance of my asking you
        this question?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... What do you mean?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Archer's hint made Kirei even more confused.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Did his previous thought process have any areas of inadequacy...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Tell me, Archer. What exactly is the significance of Matō Kariya
        obtaining the final victory?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Nothing, nothing at all&mdash;hey, don't assume such a scary
        expression. I've told you so many times that I don't have the intention
        of poking fun at you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Think about it, why did Kirei Kotomine all along not discover the
        complete meaninglessness of this question? Do you not feel that this
        matter in itself is worthy of consideration?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If this conversation were to continue, Archer would continue to lead him
        by the nose, step by step. So Kirei just gave up thinking, resting his
        entire body against the chair and saying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You might as well speak plainly, Archer."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If I had posed the same question to you using another Master as an
        example, you would definitely perceive at once that this is a completely
        meaningless question, and directly cast away such a silly question. But
        with Kariya it is different. You did not believe this to be a pointless
        question, instead interestedly immersing yourself in this sort of
        hypothetical thinking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Completely uncaring that one is doing something so futile. This
        precisely is authentic 'interest'. Congratulations, Kirei, you can
        finally understand what is 'entertainment'."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Entertainment? You speak of pleasure?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Yes."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing Archer's affirmation, Kirei resolutely shook his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In the fate of Matō Kariya, there is no element that would allow one to
        feel 'pleasure'. The longer his life, the heavier the suffering and
        lamentation accumulates on his body. To him, an earlier death would
        instead be a sort of salvation."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh Kirei, why perceive 'pleasure' that narrowly?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if facing a student with poor comprehension abilities, Archer sighed
        deeply.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Exactly what contradiction is there between suffering and lamentation
        and 'pleasure'? So-called pleasure does not take any particular form; it
        is precisely because you do not understand this that you are confused."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That's not something which should be forgiven!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei's angry voice, like a conditioned reflex, rang out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "King of Heroes, only people with evil like you will feel happiness in
        savoring the suffering of other people. But, that is the spirit of a
        sinner. An evil which must be punished. Especially you will not be on
        this path of faith I, Kotomine Kirei, live on!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So you believe that pleasure in itself is a sort of sin? Heh, you do
        make fallacious arguments. You've become a really interesting man."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just when Kirei was still considering retorting with a few words,
        suddenly an acute pain wracked his entire body, forcing him to double
        over.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"&mdash;&mdash;!?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From his forearm near the elbow came a burning pain. Though the reason
        was unknown, but this feeling Kirei had truly once felt. The same
        painful and strange feeling as now-- Kirei had felt it three years ago.
        At that time, it had been the back of his left hand. That was also when
        everything had started.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The pain was gradually replaced by waves of burning. Kirei stopped
        thinking out of surprise, only unconsciously rolling up his sleeve and
        checking his wrist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the back of his left hand, had suddenly appeared the holy marks of
        fate. The remaining Command Seals, the symbol of which part had vanished
        after having been used once against Assassin, had reappeared in their
        original size.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Heh, exactly as I thought? But this is truly too soon."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Bastard&mdash;"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        New Command Seals. The numb feeling brought about by the intense pain
        proved that these were authentic holy marks, but even thus, Kirei
        nevertheless was temporarily unable to regain his senses, stunned and
        unable to say a word.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This is completely impossible.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this point all the Masters were still alive. And not one Servant had
        had their contracts terminated. Being again granted Command Seals under
        these conditions &mdash; this sort of thing was unprecedented.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And in addition, Kirei did not belong to the '3 families of the
        beginning'. That the Holy Grail would grant him, one who has withdrawn,
        with the same holy marks&mdash;what hopes did it have of him? This was
        truly a completely incomprehensible, abnormal situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It looks as if the Grail still has high expectations of you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Archer, with a somewhat sinister smile, said.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Kotomine Kirei, you should also respond to the Grail's expectations. No
        matter what, you must have a reason to wish to obtain the Grail."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I... my reason to obtain the Grail?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If that is truly a miracle that can grant any wish&mdash;the Grail is
        definitely able to realize even what you yourself do not perceive, the
        deepest wish of your heart."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gazing at Archer's expression, Kirei suddenly felt a sense of déjà vu.
        Yes &mdash; that was depicted in the illustrations of the Bible, the
        expression of the snake of Eden.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Kirei. Thinking will not bring you the answer. It is precisely this
        sort of thought, chained by ethics, that has distorted your knowledge.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Pray that you can obtain the Grail. At that time you will find among the
        things the Grail brings you, the answer to the true happiness you seek."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"......"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">This is something Kirei has never thought about.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is a reversal of the ends and the means. Precisely because he does
        not know what his own wish is, he must obtain the Grail that can grant
        all wishes to find it out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it were just to find the answer- indeed, there is a way to find an
        immediate answer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... But if it is like this, I will have to personally destroy the
        wishes of six other people before being able to find the answer. And if
        I seek the Holy Grail for my own personal intents... I must make an
        enemy of my teacher and benefactor."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You must first look for a strong Servant. Otherwise, how will you
        contend with me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if speaking of someone else's matters, Archer leisurely drank a sip
        of red wine and said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Anyway, as a necessary precondition, you must first seize a Servant
        from the others.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for what comes after... heh, Kirei, you're on your own."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if now more interested in Kirei who had been again granted the holy
        marks, the scarlet eyes of the King of Heroes shone with the light of
        pleasure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "To pursue, for your own desires. That is the true way of entertainment.
        Then entertainment will bring pleasure, and pleasure will guide you in
        the direction of happiness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The road has been pointed out to you, Kirei. Pointed out extremely
        clearly to you."
