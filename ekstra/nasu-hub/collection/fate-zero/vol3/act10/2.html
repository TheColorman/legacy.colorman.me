        Archer looked down towards the distant, waveborne battle of Heroic
        Spirits from high in the air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What a disgraceful sight..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Heroes rode upon a shining bright ‘ark’ made of gold and
        emerald, 500 meters above the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <span class="calibre7">Gate of Babylon</span> &ndash; the treasury of
        Gilgamesh, the primeval hero who once owned all of the treasures in the
        world, stored within it the original forms of many treasures that were
        praised by the legends and myths of latter men.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The golden ark that he is using to float in the air is also one of those
        'divine secret treasures'. Indeed, this is the flying contraption that
        was passed from Babylon to India and recorded in the two epic sagas
        Ramayana and Mahabharata as the "Vimana".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although they’re mongrels, they are famous warriors at the very
        least... I wouldn’t have thought that they’ve fallen as low as joining
        together to finish that filthy thing. There should be a limit to
        deplorability. Don’t you think so, Tokiomi?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In contrast with the languid and heedless Archer, Tōsaka Tokiomi, who
        was permitted to share a seat on the ark, had a heart full of anger and
        anxiety.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For the most part, magecraft has to be used in secret &ndash; it was
        indeed due to the need to obey this basic principle that the Tōsaka
        lineage was appointed this land's

        by the Association. Caster's rampage not only threatens the progress of
        the Holy Grail War, it wholly tramples over even Tokiomi’s own prestige.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It would be a horrid tragedy if the liberated beast were to go mad
        again. If that happens, then the problem would no longer be a simple
        matter of finishing Caster's bounty, or properly conducting the Heaven’s
        Feel. Right now, this monster must be eliminated as soon as possible.
        The dignity of the Tōsaka name would be at stake if the number of
        witnesses increased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "O King, that monster is an evil creature laying waste to your garden. A
        sinner that deserves death by any means!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That’s the work of the gardener."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Archer immediately rebuked Tokiomi’s request.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Could it be, Tokiomi, that you regard this great treasure of mine as a
        gardener's hoe?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That is not what I meant! But as you can see &ndash; they won't be able
        to hold on much longer."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In truth, it is evident that the battle is progressing towards despair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Saber and Rider’s blades continued to slash the sea demon’s
        gigantic body with no respite, it showed no signs of being wounded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, it wasn’t that the Servants were holding back. The unyielding
        sword that clove rocks and the iron hooves that brought forth roaring
        thunder; they ruthlessly carved out the sea demon’s flesh, scattering
        them about in waves of blood and decay. However, the shredded wounds
        would be filled up by new flesh in the blink of an eye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The demonic monsters that Caster summoned and commanded previously also
        had physical regeneration abilities, so it was not surprising. However,
        the giant sea demon this time was indeed enormous in size. It was as if
        they were digging a hole in a marsh; the damage of the two Servants
        combined cannot keep pace with the monster's regeneration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even the utmost effort and combined attacks of the King of Knights and
        King of Conquerors could only slow down the sea demon's progress towards
        the river bank by a little.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is a great opportunity to display the majesty of a true hero.
        Please, give the command!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Heroes gave Tokiomi a glance of displeasure. Then he swung
        his right hand, which was propping up his chin on the edge of the ship.
        Four swords and spears appeared in the air next to him. The shining
        primeval Noble Phantasms unleashed a thunderous roar, and flew to impale
        the filthy mountain of meat that wriggled down below.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber and Rider reacted immediately and jumped away to avoid being
        caught in the attack, but Caster’s sea monster was in no ways so agile.
        The four Noble Phantasms hit it head on. Their power, enough to split
        mountains, blew one-third of the giant beast’s body into nothingness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was an unprecedentedly mighty impact, but Caster laughed out loud
        with an even more piercing sound.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"How can it be...?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi was dumbfounded. Beneath him, the wriggling meat mountain
        swelled up like a balloon, and repaired the damaged parts as he watched.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The physical structure of the giant meat lump was perhaps as simple as
        an amoeba. It has no bones or organs, and thus no weaknesses. Its
        movement won’t be impaired no matter which body part is destroyed, and
        it will speedily restore the destroyed parts relying on its mighty
        regeneration ability.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        " &ndash; We're leaving, Tokiomi. I can’t watch that filthy thing a
        second longer."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer spat out while his crimson irises expressed his revulsion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"But... please wait, King of Heroes!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Tokiomi, I used four Noble Phantasms for your honor. I don’t want to
        take them back now that they’ve been touched and stained by that thing.
        Don’t take my leniency so cheaply."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You are the only one who can defeat that monster!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi desperately persisted. As it had progressed into such a
        situation, he had no time to think about the prudence a liege should
        have.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "With a regeneration ability of this level, we can only destroy it
        entirely with one blow. The only one who can do this is you, the King of
        Heroes, and the Sword of Rupture &ndash; "
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Fool!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time it was Archer who raged, his pupils a burning crimson.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Draw my greatest treasure, Ea, here? You are senseless, Tokiomi! I
        should take your head for speaking such rash words to the King!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi lowered his gaze, grinding his teeth, and stayed silent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Indeed, it is impossible. With Gilgamesh's pride, he would only draw his
        his trump card, his cherished blade, when facing an opponent whom he
        recognizes as 'fitting.'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, there was no other way to completely destroy Caster’s sea
        demon. That was also the truth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was forcibly reminded of the Command Seals on his right hand. Even if
        he uses one here, he can obtain another one from the Holy Church as the
        reward for defeating Caster. However &ndash; this kind of choice would
        definitely cause the relationship between the King of Heroes and himself
        to shatter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since that’s the case, he could only place his hope on other Servants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ...And if Caster is successfully destroyed by the other Servants,
        Masters other than Tokiomi would gain the additional Command Seals held
        by Father Risei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The constrained anger caused Tokiomi to clutch his hands into fists. His
        nails dug into his palm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Why did things progress toward such an unexpected direction? It was
        supposed to be a perfectly planned and prepared Heaven’s Feel, so how
        did it turn into such a mad and chaotic situation?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that moment, a thunderous sound tore apart the sky. Tokiomi lifted
        his head stiffly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The lightless thunder could only be the residual noise of a sonic boom.
        The paired lights that flew across the night sky, north to south, were
        the identification lights of jet-propelled fighter aircraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Damn it..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The situation was deteriorating rapidly with every passing moment. For
        Tōsaka Tokiomi, the Second Owner of Fuyuki, there was nothing he could
        do except to look on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre6">X X</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        The strange scene spread below them shocked the two Eagles speechless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... What, is that...?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Captain Ōgi raked his brain and considered the possibility that his eyes
        were playing tricks on him. Beyond that, he was doubting even his own
        sanity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "And there's some strange lights at six o’clock. It's not a
        helicopter... is it a UFO or something?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The stunned voice of his wingman, 2nd Lieutenant Kobayashi, coming
        through the wireless made the situation clear. This wasn’t an illusion
        that only Captain Ōgi could see.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Control to Diablo I. Situation report."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The situation &ndash; it's, uh &ndash; "</p>
      <p class="calibre3">How can he explain this?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Disaster? Unknown craft? Airspace intrusion?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Monster &ndash; no, that can’t be considered. There isn't a codeword for
        that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In order to explain this, it must be built upon the foundation of
        current knowledge. However, such knowledge far surpassed Captain Ōgi's
        capacity of thought.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I’ll go a bit lower to look at it closely."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Wait &ndash; Kobayashi, hold it!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A nameless evil chill descended upon his back; Captain Ōgi reflexively
        tried to stop his wingman. However, Kobayashi's F15 had moved from
        circling to actual descent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Pull back! Diablo II!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If we observe it a bit closer, then we can know &ndash; "
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the two fighter jets were no longer onlookers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The opponent wasn’t a modern weapon like anti-aircraft artillery or
        missiles, so Lieutenant Kobayashi had no way to estimate the range of
        the enemy’s attacks. And first of all, it would be impossible to react
        to tentacles that can stretch over 100 meters in the blink of an eye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He couldn’t figure out what was happening even after the he lost control
        of the stick. It was as if he smacked into an invisible wall and
        spiralled into a fall. All he could do was scream.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he died this way, it may still be somewhat fortunate compared
        to what Captain Ōgi was seeing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Numerous thick and robust web-like extensions stretched out from the
        surface of the meat lump on the river and entangled Kobayashi's craft,
        forcibly dragging the plane down despite the turbofan engine's thrust.
        Such a scene can only be called a nightmare.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The plane didn’t explode when it smashed into the meat lump. The F15,
        reduced into scrap iron, sank deeply into the gigantic primeval creature
        and was swallowed with not a single fragment left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Kobayashi &ndash; "</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Having witnessed everything, Captain Ōgi's mind had gone over the
        ultimate limit of thought and comprehension, and was left solely with a
        perception alien to common sense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aah, it &ndash; <em class="calibre5">was swallowed</em>.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Control to Diablo I. What's going on?! Report!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Eyes, it has eyes, so many eyes..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite the thick mist Captain Ōgi still saw, very clearly, those
        wart-like eyes that emerged on the surface of the meat lump, which all
        opened at the same time and stared at the prey in the air above them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Captain Ōgi could feel that ‘gaze’ even in the airtight cockpit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was it. That thing was unimaginably hungry. It focused on the next
        prey after it swallowed Diablo II, and kept a death glare on it...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, overwhelming horror instead exploded into violent anger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">" &ndash; Diablo I, engaging!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"W-wait, Ōgi! Just what is &ndash; "</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He forcibly turned off the noisy radio communication and disengaged all
        safeties. 4 AIM-7F/M Sparrows. 4 AIM-9 Sidewinders. 940 rounds for the
        M61 Vulcan. All in premium condition.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kill it before he gets swallowed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ōgi's lips twisted with mad laughter, having lost all normal capacities
        of thought. At the control column of a F15, the most powerful fighter
        jet in the world, he was the true God of Death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Must avenge Kobayashi... rip that thing to shreds, then burn it to
        ashes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He turned the plane around, locking onto the target with the HUD
        reticle. He would never miss with such a giant enemy. A saturation run,
        firing all weapons at once &ndash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Powerful tremors rocked the plane’s body.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right behind him &ndash; Ōgi battle instincts, pushed to the limit, told
        him this. However, judging from its results, his sudden turn to look
        behind him delivered the final blow to his already half-shattered
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An inky-black figure suddenly appeared on the other side of the canopy,
        fully exposed to the subsonic convection currents at the back of the
        plane. Behind his obscuring helmet, his gleaming eyes emanated blazing
        fire, and his gaze harbored endless hatred and madness as he stared
        intently into the cockpit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the sealed, radio-silent iron coffin, Captain Ōgi gave a final hoarse
        scream that reached no one.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre6">X X</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        "That's..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tōsaka Tokiomi, his sight reinforced with magecraft, watched the F15
        streaking through the air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The shadow that suddenly appeared on the back of the plane, armored in
        dully shimmering titanium... only a Servant is capable of something like
        that. Judging from its appearance, it must be the Berserker mentioned in
        Kirei's reports.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The blackness on the armor corrupted the fighter jet's outer shell drop
        by drop as if it was ink.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Indeed, it was Berserker's special ability that once robbed Archer's
        Noble Phantasms away and transformed even scrap iron into demonic swords
        and spears ― perhaps that power allows him to use anything and
        everything that can be remotely conceptualized as a 'weapon'?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The black prana again corroded the sonic silver wings, and even that
        epitome of modern science was instantly changed it into a monstrous
        form.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"■■■■■■■〓〓〓〓■■!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The twenty-meter-long craft having completely fallen under his control,
        the black knight lightly gripped its back like a dragon rider of legend.
        His howl, full of vengeance, reverberated through the night sky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi had already been informed by Kirei about the primary targets of
        Berserker and its Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unexpectedly, the fiendish steel bird, now completely corroded by the
        pitch-black prana, turned its nose and charged directly towards Archer's
        airborne Vimana.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oho, is it that mad dog again...? Interesting."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Different from the initial battle at the warehouse district, Archer
        smiled wickedly and rose to Berserker's challenge. Tokiomi had no idea
        about what may have changed the King of Heroes' thoughts, and he didn't
        want to ponder about it either.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After all, Tokiomi had already vowed in the past to defeat that enemy
        with his own hands. He wasn't put off with doing it himself as the other
        man was an opponent who had more or less troubled him personally.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Standing at the edge of the ark, Tokiomi looked towards the highest
        vantage point in the area, which would be the ideal spot to spy upon
        Tokiomi's group ― as expected, on the high-rise apartment complex where
        he locked his gaze, the opponent he wished for appeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That man stood there, this time with no intention of concealing himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The left side of his face was like a corpse, distorted and stiff with
        pain. His right eye was like a devil's, burning with the flames of
        hatred.
      </p>

        His eyes crossed with Tokiomi's and wordlessly declared battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"O' King, let me be the Master's opponent."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Very well. You can have your fun."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Vimana glided through the air and brought Tokiomi right above his
        target. It would be approximately an eighty meter descent. For a magus,
        such a distance is nothing to be afraid of.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The fortunes of war upon us."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi took his staff Mystic Code, smoothed the edge of his overcoat,
        and fearlessly leapt down from the sky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Alone on the Vimana, Archer gazed at the pursuing steel shadow, his eyes
        burning with a sadistic light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "A despicable and lowly dog only fit to prostrate on the ground now
        soaring into the heavens where kings dance... Even as a jester you are
        beyond help, mongrel!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He unleashed <span class="calibre7">Gate of Babylon</span>, throwing out
        a continuous attack of six Noble Phantasms. Sparking with blinding
        brilliance, spears and blades charged to meet Berserker like comets,
        trailed by light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The twin turbofan engine, receiving Berserker's alien power, gave off a
        monstrous roar. The black F15 used its acceleration to exponentially
        increase its relative velocity, breaking through a gap in the
        tightly-knit screen of Noble Phantasms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Archer's Noble Phantasms did not lose their lethality simply
        because they were avoided. Three out of the six - an axe, a scythe, and
        a scimitar - immediately spun, changing direction and closing in on the
        F15's tail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as they were about to hit, the black F15 writhed its ailerons and
        flaps like a living creature, escaping the blade edges of Archer's Noble
        Phantasms with aerodynamically impossible abruptness. With a second,
        then a third barrel roll, the barrage of Noble Phantasms scattered away
        into the sky. The intense G's of the first spin was enough to instantly
        kill Captain Ōgi in the cockpit, rupturing his internal organs; but of
        course, this was just a trifle for Berserker.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as it dodged all the attacks, the F15 forcibly performed an
        <span id="calibre_link-14"

        and aimed its nose towards Archer, the pylons under its wings sputtering
        the flames of rocket motors. Two Sparrow missiles attacked Archer's
        Vimana with vengeance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although ordinary weapons would be useless in a battle of Servants, the
        weapons that Berserker corroded were of a different caliber. Carrying
        the prana of hatred, every single shot of the twenty-six-pound
        explosives had an annihilating might.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"How impertinent..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer boldly smiled and placed his hand on the Vimana's helm.
        Immediately, the ark of light accelerated and evaded the missiles'
        attack with an elegance that Berserker's brute force control can never
        compare with. The legendary flying Noble Phantasm, crossing the sky at
        the speed of thought, has already surpassed the laws of physics.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"〓〓〓〓〓〓〓〓〓〓〓〓〓〓〓!!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mad black knight roared. As if echoing his malicious call, the front
        stabilizers of the two Sparrows suddenly twisted and once again they
        bared their fangs towards the Vimana which had evaded the first attack.
        Even the electronic radar-guided missiles have been transformed into
        magic weapons that chased the subject of Berserker's hatred like hounds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Archer sneered at the incoming threat, deploying
        <span class="calibre7">Gate of Babylon</span> once again. He took out
        two shields and stood them in the sky, striking down the cursed
        missiles. With the ark shaking with the impact of the explosion, the red
        eyes of the King of Heroes were gradually stained with a shade of
        fanaticism.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Interesting... I haven't played like this for a long time. Even a mere
        wild beast can make me so pleased!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer's laughter raised as the Vimana's altitude sharply increased.
        Berserker's F15 once again gave pursuit, clawing at its back. The two
        instantly broke through the sound barrier, falling up through the sea of
        clouds in the night sky, climbing ever higher as the dogfight continued.
      </p>

      <p class="calibre3">

        The thick evening mist enveloped the icy air as Tōsaka Tokiomi descended
        from the sky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For a proficient magus, a controlled descent through manipulating mass
        and air currents is nothing too difficult. Or perhaps it should be said
        that the degree of proficiency is determined by the elegance of its
        execution.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maintaining an absolutely vertical and straight path, landing as lightly
        as feather with his clothes and hair completely unruffled － an ordinary
        magus would definitely give a heartfelt praise upon seeing such an
        exemplary and skilled move like Tokiomi's.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But Matō Kariya had already transformed into something else. There was
        absolutely no respect or admiration towards magecraft in his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Respect had turned into hatred, admiration had turned into anger. For
        Kariya, whose body was twisted into a thing ugly beyond comparison,
        Tokiomi's elegance and flamboyance deserve to be cursed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <em class="calibre5"
          >You bastard － you are always like this no matter what.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His speech, his manners, and that royal disposition - this man has been
        'perfect' ever since the day he appeared before Aoi and Kariya. That
        elegance and ease had always made Kariya feel the difference in their
        'ranks'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">However, that will end tonight.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Elegance, something that this man paid the most attention to, is nothing
        on the battlefield where every man slaughtered one other. Now, right
        here, the Tōsaka family creed that was held in such pride will be
        dragged through the mud, destroyed...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Berserker, already in battle, began to mercilessly wring Kariya out of
        his prana. The agonizing pain caused by the maddening activity of the
        crest worms inside him was as if his hands and feet were being slashed
        by razors. His bones were rent, his eyes blurred.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, such a pain is nothing when compared to the hatred that tore
        and gnawed at Kariya's heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">" － It looks like you've changed, Matō Kariya."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sharp, narrowing eyes that looked as though they were pitying; Tōsaka
        Tokiomi's showed his ease before battle and deliberately taunted Kariya.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Discarding the way of magecraft, yet still longing after the Holy Grail
        and even returning to it in a form like this... Your shameful sight
        alone would be enough to cause slander of degradation of the Matō
        family."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya replied with a mocking laugh. The sound that emerged from his
        mouth sounded like the chirping of insects even to himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Tōsaka Tokiomi, I'll only ask you one thing... Why did you hand Sakura
        to Zōken?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...What?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi furrowed his brows when he heard this completely unexpected
        question.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is this a question you should care about at this time?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Answer me, Tokiomi!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tokiomi sighed, and said to the agitated Kariya.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        " － You should know it without needing to ask. I only want my beloved
        daughter to have a happy future."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What... did you, say?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Upon receiving this incomprehensible reply, Kariya's brain momentarily
        blanked out. While Kariya froze, Tokiomi continued with an indifferent
        tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Any magus with a second child would be troubled &ndash; the secret
        craft can only be passed on to one of them. This is a dilemma where one
        of the children must fall into mediocrity."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Mediocrity －</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That word echoed in Kariya's empty mind. Sakura, who has lost her smile,
        and the image of Rin playing with Aoi... Tokiomi's words mixed into his
        few happy memories.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The image of the mother and her daughters from so long ago － did this
        man cleave it apart and discarded it just with the word 'mediocrity'?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is especially so since my wife is very outstanding as a mothering
        body. Both Rin and Sakura are born with equal and rare natural talents.
        Both daughters must have the protection of a house of magi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Robbing away one's potential for the other's future － no father would
        hope for such a tragedy to occur."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya couldn't understand the reasons flowing out of Tokiomi － no, he
        didn't want to understand. He felt that he was going to start throwing
        up on the spot if he understood just a small part of this magus'
        philosophy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The only thing to do in order to preserve both sisters' talents is to
        give one away for adoption. Old man Matō's request was a godsend. As a
        house that knows of the Holy Grail's existence, the possibility of
        reaching 'Akasha' is even higher. Even if I can't complete it, there's
        still Rin, and if Rin fails there's still Sakura; someone will always
        inherit the Tōsaka family's wish."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You bastard..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        How can he speak of such a despairing truth with a still expression?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If they both walk the road leading to 'Akasha', then －
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...You want them to fight each other? Sister against sister?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Faced with Kariya's accusation, Tokiomi gave an unbidden laugh and
        nodded with a cold expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Even if such a situation is to result, it is still happiness to the
        remnants of my house. If we succeed, the glory will be in our own hands;
        even if we fail, the glory will belong to our ancestral name. There is
        no such thing as a confrontation without sorrow."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're insane!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Faced with Kariya, who was gritting his teeth, Tokiomi merely gave a
        cold glance and called out mockingly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's a waste to tell you anyways. You are someone who doesn't
        understand the nobility of the way of magecraft at all, and had left the
        way and betrayed the art."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Bullshit!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hatred and anger, surpassing their uttermost limit, stimulated the crest
        worms within Kariya into life. An evil chill and agonizing pain passed
        through his entire body. Even so, it is a blessing for the current
        Kariya.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Erode me, devour my body. Let all the prana created thus become a curse
        for my nemesis...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Worms slithered out from the shadows around them like galloping waves
        and gathered to one place. These are disgusting crawling worms that
        looked like maggots and have the size of mice. All of these were the
        fangs Kariya acquired from Matō Zōken before Kariya became a Master －
        weapons to deal with battles outside the laws of the ordinary world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I won't forgive any of you... you disgusting magi...!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I'll kill you! And Zōken! Kill until none of you are left!!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The worms that took in Kariya's hatred twitched and twisted together in
        agony. Soon shimmering, steely shells and wings emerged from cracks
        straight down their backs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One by one － the slithering worms metamorphosed into giant beetles,
        which buzzed as they spread their wings and formed battalions as they
        flew around Kariya. A giant group amassed in the blink of an eye. These
        'blade wing worms' adjusted into battle formation as they grinded their
        sharp jaws threateningly and ferociously. As a worm-user, this is Matō
        Kariya's deadliest hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tōsaka Tokiomi's expression was still impassive, faced with a mass of
        carnivorous worms that could devour a bull and crush even its bones in
        an instant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His level as a magus was far above Kariya, after all. Therefore, the
        suicidal secret craft that Kariya released was neither awe-inspiring nor
        frightening for Tokiomi. He could even spite this mockery of fate with
        ease in this battle to decide the victor between two former rival
        suitors.

        The defensive form that traced the Tōsaka family crest in the air turned
        into crimson flames and burned the night air. This is an aggressive
        defense that will burn everything it touches to ashes; even to him, it
        feels childish to use this against a complete novice of an enemy, but he
