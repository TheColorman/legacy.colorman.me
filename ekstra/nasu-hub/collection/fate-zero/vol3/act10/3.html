      <p class="calibre3">"That's... awesome! Totally awesome!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Uryū Ryūnosuke was so overwhelmed with excitement that, heedless of his
        surroundings, he raised his voice to a strange shriek, his whole body
        shaking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was not alone with the crowd of onlookers now gathering at
        the riverside, none of them were concerned with Ryūnosuke's odd
        behavior. Every set of eyes were fixed on the otherworldly, impossible
        phenomenon unfolding before them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the river's surface, a giant rampaging monster. In the sky, sparks
        flew as a UFO clashed with a Self Defense Force fighter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A spectacle never before seen that anyone would deride as hackneyed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Serves you all right! Ryūnosuke cheered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With their mouths agape, everyone present stared dumbly at the reality
        in front of their eyes. At their wit's end, the only thing they could do
        was watch as 'common sense', the worthless idol they had blindly
        worshiped and utterly believed in, loudly came crashing down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <em class="calibre5"
          >How's that, you bastards? It's always been me on the losing side,
          until now. Frustrating, isn't it? Pathetic, eh?</em
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <em class="calibre5"
          >None of you even imagined - didn't even try to imagine - how awesome
          and bizarre the world is outside the walls of common sense.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <em class="calibre5"
          >But me? Of course I know. I've expected it; hoped for it. That
          someday, I can see something tremendous. That's why I only ever do the
          abnormal, seeking out novelties every day, wandering in a frenzy.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <em class="calibre5"
          >And ― I've finally found it. The treasure chest I've been seeking
          for.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <em class="calibre5"
          >Yeah, God definitely exists. This extraordinary sight is my
          proof.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The one who snickeringly brought out such absurdities just to see the
        trembling expressions of his pitiful lambs was the great Trickster in
        His heaven. The God he had been seeking all along finally appeared; all
        the prepared jack-in-the-boxes, set up in this place and that, all
        opened at once and spouted flames.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is a farewell to tedium. There is no longer a need to devote time
        and effort into murder. Even if it's left alone, tons of people are
        going to die. Crushed and ripped apart and smashed open and devoured and
        die and die and die endlessly. The color of a blondy's guts, the
        sensation of a black man's spleen, even those bowels that I haven't seen
        before; I can experience them one after another! Day by day, I'll be
        swept up in interesting things, right in the center of the world!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Continuously, ceaselessly!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Aaaahhh! The Lord has come! The Lord has come!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He raised his fists high in triumph, singing and springing and
        celebrating this victory of a lifetime. Ryūnosuke shouted encouragements
        to his comrade who had become the rampaging monster.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Go for it, Sir Bluebeard! Destroy them! Slaughter them! This is God's
        own toy box!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Just then, he was shoved hard by an unseen hand.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Falling painfully on his backside, he looked around, shocked. Nobody was
        near enough to touch Ryūnosuke. On the contrary, the people around him
        started to scream and back away when they saw him. It was as though he
        was one of the absurdities in the river and in the sky, appearing right
        before their eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What is it? Hey, what?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as Ryūnosuke expectantly started asking the people around him where
        this new oddity was occurring, he casually put his hand to his stomach
        and felt something hot and slippery... and then, he started fixedly at
        his own hand, dyed crimson.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Whoooa..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Red. Pure, captivating red.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The glistening, vivid, fundamental color that he had always been
        seeking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ah, this is it ― Ryūnosuke instantly understood, a faint smile on his
        pale lips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The color he was searching for all along. The thing he teared through
        all sorts of places to find but could never obtain, the true "red".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lovingly, he embraced his abdomen, gushing with fresh blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I see...... I never realized, huh......”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The darkest place is under the candlestick" - those words were well
        said. He had never thought that what he was seeking could be hidden
        somewhere so near himself...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was intoxicated, his skull completely filled by the surging
        analgesia. The second shot struck him in the center of the forehead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though his entire head above the nose had been blown away without a
        trace, his lips still traced a smile of total bliss.
      </p>
      <center class="calibre6">X X</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Got him ― confident, Emiya Kiritsugu, kneeling on one knee on the deck
        of the ship, lowered the muzzle of the Walther night vision sniper
        rifle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was about two hundred meters downstream from Caster's monster, close
        to the heart of the river at Fuyuki Bridge. Kiritsugu, who happened to
        have been staking out the harbor just as Caster appeared, promptly chose
        one of nearby empty yachts and commandeered it, arriving here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Needless to say, it never crossed his mind to attack the monster Caster
        had become. Using the panic as cover, Kiritsugu's aim once again was to
        'hunt' the Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The light amplification scope loses its efficiency as the number of
        particles in the air increased, making it useless in this fog; however,
        this was no trouble for the infrared scope, crucial for differentiating
        magi. Within the gathering crowd of onlookers, Kiritsugu searched for
        the thermal pattern characteristic of Magic Circuits. As a result, one
        of those individuals was gunned down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under these circumstances, anyone loitering near the riverside while
        keeping Magic Circuits active must be involved in the Holy Grail War.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The probability of his target being the Master of Caster was over sixty
        percent. For now, taking the shot was the right choice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Incidentally, due to Kiritsugu's position, the two warring magi on top
        of the nearby high-rise apartment were in a blind spot, and spared from
        his gunshots.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"......This is bad."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although that particular incident was resolved successfully, Kiritsugu's
        expression soured as he turned around and confirmed the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter how favorably he looked at it, Saber and Rider's strenuous
        attempt to halt the sea monster was going poorly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even presuming that he had hit his target, it still requires a certain
        amount of time before the Servant, cut off from a prana supply, becomes
        unable to maintain its link to the modern era and disappear. If Caster
        reaches the bank and begins 'feeding' before this happens, that would be
        the end. Once it gains a new prana source, they would have no choice but
        to eliminate it physically.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And finally, the immortal, infinitely-regenerating monster is on the
        verge on pushing onto the shallow riverside.
      </p>
      <center class="calibre6">X X</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite grinding her teeth in despair, Saber was neither frightened nor
        daunted, and continued to brandish her sword.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter how deep her slashes, the wound would be filled instantly
        without a trace. This was a fruitless effort ― no, if they could just
        slow the monster down even by a little this battle would have meaning.
        However, when the impending outcome is considered, this equates to no
        more than futile resistance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">If only she could use her left hand...</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it was an unavoidable regret, Saber could not help but consider
        it. Even with the exceptionally powerful Noble Phantasms possessed by
        Rider and Archer, it will not be enough to fell this monster. No matter
        how large a force they use to trample it, it is meaningless if all its
        injuries can be regenerated from instantly. To defeat this horror, one
        must simply deliver a strike that covers it entirely, obliterating it
        down to the last scrap of flesh ― what is needed is not an Anti-Army,
        but an Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="Sword of Promised Victory" class="calibre8"
            >Excalibur</span
          ></span
        >
        could achieve this, but Saber could not use it now. The fatal secret
        technique which releases in a single blow an enormous surge of energy
        rivaling her entire prana supply; no matter the circumstance, for her to
        use it, she must swing the sword with both hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Naturally, it would risk Saber's pride for her to face Lancer now and
        complain to him at great length about this - impossible to even
        consider. The handicap of her left hand is her debt for vowing to settle
        her match with Lancer fairly. In the Einsbern forest, Lancer came of his
        own free will to 'serve as her left hand'; in the name of the King of
        Knights, she must repay him for his spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hey, Saber! We'll accomplish nothing like this. Retreat for now!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Rider's voice coming from his chariot directly above her, Saber
        replied angrily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What nonsense are you speaking! If we do not stop it here ― "
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is a stalemate! Just pull back. I have an idea!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She was compelled. Delivering a blow with all her strength as a parting
        gift, Saber dashed across the river's surface in pursuit of Rider, and
        retreated to the riverside where Lancer and Irisviel were waiting. Saber
        kicked off from the water and leapt onto the river bank. At the same
        time, Rider's chariot landed, descending from empty space accompanied by
        lightning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Listen, all of you. No matter what steps we take after this, right now
        we have to buy some time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dispensing with greetings, Rider spoke urgently. Even the King of
        Conquerors did not maintain his easygoing composure this time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "For the time being I'll drag that thing into
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="Army of the King" class="calibre8"
            >Ionioi Hetairoi</span
          ></span
        >. Well, it'll probably be impossible to destroy it completely even with
        my elites. Confining it in my Reality Marble is the best I can do."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What do we do after that?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">At Lancer's question,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"No idea."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider replied blankly. Nevertheless, from his grave expression, it is
        obvious that he was not joking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Buying time to stave off an emergency ― even with the King of
        Conquerors' hidden technique, this was all that could be done.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After taking in such a giant, I can maintain my bounded field of troops
        for a few minutes at most. During that time, by any means possible ―
        Heroic Spirits, find a strategy that will grant us victory. Boy, you
        stay here too."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he finished, Rider plucked Waver out of the charioteer's
        carriage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"H-Hey?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Once the bounded field is deployed, I will have no way of knowing the
        situation outside. Boy, if something happens, concentrate and call me.
        I'll dispatch a messenger to you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though they were allied right now, from Waver's perspective, having him
        and his own Servant go separate ways and leaving himself alone with two
        other Servants was extremely dangerous and reckless. However, nothing
        can be resolved if they all simply stood on guard against their allies'
        treachery.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though his heart was quivering with fear, with a sullen look, the youth
        nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Saber, Lancer, the rest is up to you two."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...Got it."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...Understood."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though the two had spoken in agreement, they were both extremely bitter.
        Everyone present understood that Rider's decision was simply an
        emergency reaction without an actual solution.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nevertheless, it was as though he placed his full trust in the Heroic
        Spirits he had appraised. After gathering his resolve, Rider aimed the
        chariot at the savage giant monster, and charged - without distress on
        his face, without once looking back.
