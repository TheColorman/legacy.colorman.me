      <p class="calibre3">
        Emiya Kiritsugu clicked his tongue as he intently watched this
        unexpected turn of events.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ship had already been anchored after moving to the appointed
        location, and the preparations for the engine-powered escape lifeboat
        loaded aboard were finished. Saber had also successfully regained her
        Noble Phantasm of certain kill; all that’s left was to summon Rider back
        and get him to free Caster's sea demon &ndash; just as he thought this,
        Berserker, as though he had somehow lost control of himself, suddenly
        shifted his focus, from the battle he had with Archer until now, to
        Saber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, now that he thought about it, this was already the second time
        that Saber was challenged by Berserker without reason. Even when they
        first met at the warehouse district, as soon as the black knight lost
        his target, he assaulted Saber like a starving beast. It could be passed
        off as a coincidence if it only happened once, but that can’t be said
        for a second time. To begin with, he had suddenly changed targets while
        completely ignoring his initial target of Archer, who was still going
        strong.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, even for Archer, boasting an extraordinary amount of pride,
        this outrage was an inexcusable disdain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Have you no control? Mad dog!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer cursed as he accelerated Vimana and soon approached Berserker’s
        back, close enough that he could kill him for certain. There was now so
        little distance between them that the opponent would never be able to
        evade the barrage of Noble Phantasms from
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="Treasures of the King" class="calibre8"
            >Gate of Babylon</span
          ></span
        >
        regardless of his transcendent mobility &ndash; however, this decision
        backfired on him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the underside of the F15's body, scorching fireballs, like
        will-o'-the-wisps, slowly scattered in succession, washing over the nose
        of the trailing Vimana.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What!?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, this armament called a flare dispenser simply launched out
        decoy heat sources in order to throw off the enemy’s heat-seeking
        missiles. However, as a result of being eroded by Berserker’s prana and
        demonized, they have even transfigured into tracking incendiary weapons.
        Based on their dogfight up until now, Archer made the hasty conclusion
        that the enemy doesn’t have a way of attacking against an enemy behind
        him, and therefore couldn’t cope in time to this unexpected
        counterattack. The bow of the Vimana plunged into the hive of roaring
        fire balls, lost control while surrounded by the crimson flames, and
        fell towards the surface of the river in a spiral.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he finally obtained the result of felling Archer, Berserker
        thought nothing of it right now. The fiendish steel bird did not even
        confirm the whereabouts of Archer after he sunk into the river, and with
        nothing but relentlessness, instead tracked down Saber and mercilessly
        poured down a rain of 20mm rounds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Saber, although the F15 that Berseker spurred on was a completely
        unknown weapon, her skill of sixth sense, equivalent to precognition,
        allowed her to comprehend with extreme accuracy the nature of this
        threat. Just before she was hit by the initial strafing run, Saber had
        sensed that this attack would result in wide-area destruction. Promptly
        realizing that Irisviel may be caught in the battle if she stayed on the
        river bank, she once again leapt onto the water surface and sought a
        path of retreat on the river.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As this was an unavoidable decision, the result guided her to yet
        another dilemma.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        By good command of footwork as a Servant, Saber would be able to rival a
        jet fighter in speed and galloped on top of the water. However, this
        vast river surface, with no obstacles at all, was undoubtedly the best
        hunting ground for the black knight who strafed down from the air above.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The bullets pouring out like torrential rain swept behind the galloping
        Saber, missing her by a hair, and scattered raging sheets of water like
        the streams of an upward waterfall.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Regardless of the size of the caliber, something on the level of
        <i class="calibre5">mere cannon shells</i> pose no threat to Servants at
        all. This is especially so with Saber, whose physical abilities would
        also her to evade them with no difficulty, and even deflect the shots
        back with the blade of her sword if she wanted to. However &ndash; no
        matter how extraordinary the Heroic Spirit may be, the 12,000
        rounds-per-minute of the pride of America's General Electric, the M61
        autocannon, presented an unmanageable amount of shots. Worse yet, as a
        weapon carrying the properties of a Noble Phantasm due to Berserker’s
        prana, a single shot would instantly be fatal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“And I finally recovered my left hand…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber was bitterly regretting. Even now, it would be possible for her to
        use her Noble Phantasm without hesitation and destroy Berserker in the
        air, but the enemy’s tenacious and incessant attacks didn’t allow her
        any opportunity to counterattack. Berserker’s battle tactics were both
        accurate and prudent, as though he knew the full extent of Saber's
        abilities. In order to hunt a lion, the best method is to keep chasing
        it, not giving it a single chance to bare its fangs, strangling it;
        Berserker's skill was like that of a hunter who fully knew the essence
        of this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Abruptly, restless tremors spread from the river bank all the way into
        its surroundings. Only the magi present knew just what these
        unexplainable tremor meant &ndash; the epicenter was probably the inside
        of the Reality Marble that Rider expanded. The powerful quakes of the
        raging sea demon were finally beginning to affect normal space. It was
        an omen that Rider's Reality Marble was finally approaching its ultimate
        limit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He must let Rider know of the situation here. Waver, after deciding as
        such, began to concentrate his thoughts to calling out his own Servant.
        Having no knowledge of telepathy, Waver could only rely on speech to
        come to a mutual understanding. However, Rider, who knew this, did say
        that ‘I’ll leave a herald for you”.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The space beside Waver abruptly shook, and the form of a knight emerged.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Mithrenes of the
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="Companions" class="calibre8">Hetairoi</span></span
        >
        rides forth to listen in the King’s stead!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Overawed by the intrepid demeanor of the Heroic Spirit and his simple
        salutation, Waver faltered. However, he changed his mind, knowing that
        it was not the time to pay attention to such things, and mustered the
        courage in his heart to give directions to this Heroic Spirit he’s never
        met before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I want you to release the bounded field and throw Caster out to the
        appointed location as soon I give the signal. You can do that, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It can be done &ndash; but it is a race against time. It appears that
        our army inside the bounded field cannot stop that sea demon for much
        longer…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I know! I’m aware of that!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Waver grumbled he also attended to Saber, who kept dodging the
        attacks of the black knight, with a heart full of prayers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Damn it, Berserker, that bastard… can't something be done about him?!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; I will go.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer, responding resolutely, disappeared after grasping the now
        solitary crimson spear. The spearman that temporarily turned into
        spiritual form accurately materialized again on the body of the F15,
        steadying himself by grabbing the steel wings pulsing with black prana
        with one hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“It all ends here, mad warrior!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No sooner had Lancer shouted this that he brandished the
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="Crimson Rose of Exorcism" class="calibre8"
            >Gáe Dearg</span
          ></span
        >
        in his right hand above his head, and pierced the body of the grotesque
        machine with the spear tip.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The red spear that can cut through all prana circulation gleamed. It was
        indeed the archenemy of Berserker’s peculiar ability. But the black
        knight has had his full share of the power of this attack after the
        battle in the warehouse district. The mysterious Servant, maddened but
        not without prudence, did not make the same mistake when faced with
        Lancer’s Noble Phantasm. Right before the red spear skewered the craft's
        body, Berserker promptly discarded the doomed F15, and leapt high into
        the sky after using his arms to wretch off the important part of the
        craft. Immediately after, the fighter jet, reverted to a mass of scrap
        metal in an instant by
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="Crimson Rose of Exorcism" class="calibre8"
            >Gáe Dearg</span
          ></span
        >
        cutting off its prana, crashed with Lancer on its wings, throwing up a
        splendid sheet of water from the Mion river.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The part that Berserker seized at the last minute was naturally the
        section accommodating the Vulcan unit. The autocannon, having avoided
        direct contact with Lancer’s spear with a hair's breadth, was still
        pulsing with the jet black prana that supplemented it, and did not lose
        the properties of being the black knight’s Noble Phantasm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“■〓〓〓〓■■■■■■〓〓〓〓!!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Carrying the six barrels and the cylindrical ammunition casing, weighing
        200 kilogram in total, Berserker once again aimed from the sky at Saber
        below him. The rotary cannon, accelerated by prana, spun up in the blink
        of an eye. Saber finally realized that she had nowhere else to turn in
        the instant the torrential bullets were about to surge out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The firing distance for Berserker, having jumped down from the aircraft
        and continuing to aim at Saber as he descended. was exceptionally closer
        than before. Saber no longer had time to anticipate for the initial
        velocity of the rounds, and no matter which way she may dodge, she
        couldn’t get out of the range of the rain of shells about to pour onto
        her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <em class="calibre5">It's all or nothing...!</em>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that it has come to this, Saber was prepared to resort to using her
        Noble Phantasm, misplaced though it may be; the instant she swung the
        sword over her head, streaks of shining steel came flying in from an
        impossible angle and struck Berserker head on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hammer, axe and bolt gouged the jet black armor, and a giant sickle
        cleaved the body of the revolving gun barrel in half. Furthermore, a
        flaming bolt hit the ammunition storage directly, igniting all the
        remaining 20mm shells, blossoming wild crimson flames in the air.
        Berserker, washed over by the fragments and blast, was helplessly blown
        away, drawing a parabola in the empty air before sinking into the river
        surface like a thrown rock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Astounded, Saber turned around and, looking up, saw Archer standing
        haughtily on the top of the arch of the Fuyuki Bridge. The shooting
        Noble Phantasms encircled him, surrounding him like an halo. He let out
        a wicked smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Now, Saber, show it to me. I shall see for myself the true worth of
        your brilliance as a Heroic Spirit.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It didn't even need to be said - Saber replied to Archer's insolent
        words with a silent glance, and once again returned her sight to the
        river surface, adjusting her stance with the golden sword.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All obstacles have been eliminated. Now was the time of conclusion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu, who witnessed Berserker’s departure, was on a life boat
        already galloping to the safety zone. He aimed for and shot up a flare
        at a spot in the empty sky. The roaring yellow phosphorus flame was
        right above the line connecting Saber’s current position and the
        speedboat that Kiritsugu abandoned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“There! Right under it!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver immediately saw the signal and yelled at Rider's herald beside
        him. The Heroic Spirit Mithrenes disappeared without so much as a nod,
        returning to the inside of the bounded field where the king and his
        companions were waiting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immediately after, as though it had been in wait, the air around them
        shook, and the space that was eroded by the thoughts of the Heroic
        Spirits returned to the shape it was meant to have. Firstly, an alien
        shadow covered the night sky like a mirage, then its real form emerged
        in an instant; the giant and ominous body then fell into the water. That
        place was directly underneath where Kiritsugu shot the flare.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The raging sheets of water thrown up by the gigantic mass impacting the
        water assaulted the river bank like a tsunami. However, Saber, the only
        one who had fought and held her own in direct combat with the sea demon,
        was not hit by even a single splash. The prana gushing out from her
        right now summoned a surging wind so pressurized that it brushed aside
        the wall of water.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time as the reappearance of the sea demon, Rider’s chariot
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="Wheel of Heaven's Authority" class="calibre8"
            >Gordius Wheel</span
          ></span
        >
        also leapt into the dim night sky once again. Its scar-covered form told
        of the degree of intensity of the battle that played out inside the
        Reality Marble, but his majestic and awe-inspiring flying form was not
        diminished at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Seriously! Just what took all of you so long… Woah!?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was during Rider's moment of complaint that he saw the concentration
        of light pulsing from Saber’s sword; he immediately understood what was
        happening and urgently turned aside, escaping the area under threat. On
        the other hand, Caster’s sea demon wouldn’t be able to dodge so
        dexterously no matter what. The giant throbbing meat lump could do
        nothing apart from shrieking to scare this unknown brilliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The time was ripe.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Pouring all the strength in her body into the two arms grasping the hilt
        tightly, the King of Knights lifted the golden sword up high.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Light gathered. As if illuminating this holy sword was its ultimate
        duty, the light condensed further, merging into a blinding brilliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the fierceness and purity of this beam of light, no one could speak a
        single word.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was the gallant figure of a knight who once shone the light of
        purification upon into a battle-ravaged world, a darkness blacker than
        night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unyielding for ten years, undefeated in twelve battles. These peerless
        feats of arms and this glory were eternal, transcending time.

      <p class="calibre3">
        Proudly uplifting this will, ascertaining that this faith will be seen

        Light galloped.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Light roared.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The prana, accelerated by the factor of the released dragon, became a
        streak of light, a swirling and surging torrent that devoured the sea
        demon together with the dark night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A silent scream rose within the river water evaporating in an instant,
        as every single atom composing the body of the giant sea demon that had
        been the embodiment of terror were exposed to the scorching impact.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But in the center of the sea demon being completely burnt to cinders,
        within a fortress of bulky defiled flesh, Caster simply wordlessly
        watched over this moment of white blinding annihilation which had stolen
        his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…O, Oh…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yes &ndash; it was unmistakeably a light he had once seen in the distant
        past.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Had he not once been a knight who pursued and rode after this light?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The recollection, vivid and utterly unclouded, brought Gilles back to
        the distant past.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was the light that shone through the stained-glass windows of the
        great cathedral, at the long-awaited coronation ceremony of King
        Charles. It was a white brilliance, a blessing of joy that wrapped
        around Jeanne and Gilles, who had attended as saviors and national
        heroes, together with the <em class="calibre5">ars nova</em> melody.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Aah, there’s no mistake &ndash; it was this light.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could still remember it. Even now, after his fall into brutality, his
        entire body smeared with corruption, the memories of that day did not
        fade at all and remained carved into his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if his end was stained with humiliation and revulsion, no matter
        how much he may be held in contempt &ndash; the glory in his past alone
        cannot be denied or overturned, for it was in his heart.

        Something that even God or Fate will never be able to take away or
        violate…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gilles de Rais was dumbstruck by the clarity of his own rapidly falling
        tears.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What was he confused with? Had he lost sight of something?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he could just look back and admit it &ndash; wouldn’t that be enough?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Just what, have I…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before this murmur, directed at no one, left his mouth, all matter was
        brought into another world, annihilated by the white light.

      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer, standing on the high arch of the bridge and looking down upon
        all, couldn’t help but have a smile emerging on his face when he saw
        this light of destruction that burnt and consumed all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Do you see it, King of Conquerors? This is Saber’s light.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer addressed the empty space beside him. Rider, who had just
        experienced a merciless fight, was letting the chariot pulled by divine
        bulls remain still in the air, and was gazing dazedly at the ultimate
        light Excalibur was emanating.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Do you still not want to acknowledge her after witnessing that ray of
        light?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider snorted, dismissing Archer’s question. However, what was on his
        face as not despite or mockery, but a solemnity as if he was looking out
        over a thing of tragic grandeur.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It was indeed because she took upon her shoulders the hope of every man
        of the time that she’s able to display such might &ndash; it’s painful
        precisely because it is so blindingly brilliant. Who could have thought
        that the person carrying such a heavy weight is only a little girl who
        liked to dream?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the river surface, which the two of them looked down upon, Saber’s
        slender body was huffing painfully due to the intensive battle to the
        death that had just ended. Rider only knew what kind of heaviness was
        piled upon her young and delicate shoulders thanks to last night’s quiz.
        For him, whose personality is open and straightforward, this kind of
        ‘way of living’ is absolutely unforgivable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This kind of little girl is truly the final result of someone who
        discarded youthful romance and dreams, discarded love, and sunk into the
        eternal curse of ‘ideals’. It is truly painful, and one can’t bear to
        look upon it anymore.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This is exactly what’s lovely about her, isn’t it?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Different from the King of Conqueror’s fully melancholic expression, the
        golden Servant’s smile was immeasurably obscene and did not hide his
        dirty desires at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The overly-mighty ideal that she harbored within her would burn her
        into nothing but ashes at the end. Those tears that she would shed at
        her final moment… I imagine it would be very sweet to the taste.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Complacent, Archer let his imagination run wild. With a flick of his
        eyes, Rider gave him a look of enmity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… It seems I still can’t like you, Babylonian King of Heroes.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Oh? You only discerned it now?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This title made the sparkling golden Heroic Spirit burst fully into a
        smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What do you plan to do, Rider? Want to use brutal force right now to
        unleash your anger?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Although it’ll be quite a joy to do that, tonight my strength would
        perhaps not live up to my feelings if my opponent is you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After Rider spoke the truth straightforwardly and with no exaggeration,
        he gave another look at Archer and said scornfully: “Of course, if you
        don’t want to let the chance pass and insist in fighting with me, this
        king would gladly do so at anytime.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “No matter. I permit you to escape, King of Conquerors. I wouldn’t feel
        satisfied if I don’t defeat you at the height of your strength,
        anyways.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this self-possessed declaration from Archer, Rider lifted his
        eyebrows as if pulling a prank.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hmm? Hahaha. Though you say that, the truth must be that your wounds
        caused by being sunk by Blackie haven’t healed properly either, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… All who provokes the king need to die to repent their sin!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing how the other didn’t take the joke well and that his twin red
        irises were full with a killing intent, Rider tightened the reins of the
        divine bulls with a smile and increased the distance between them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Decide the victor next time, King of Heroes. The owner of the Holy
        Grail, I imagine, would perhaps be the result of our battle.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only ones who are worthy to obtain the Grail are the Heroic Spirits
        at the level of ‘Kings’. That is, one of the two between the King of
        Conquerors and the King of Heroes. Undoubtedly, Rider himself still
        believed firmly in that point right now. The Heroic Spirit Alexander
        smiled fearlessly and left the top of the arch of the bridge, and as
        thus galloped towards the river bank where his Master was at.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What would happen at the end?... Rider, I still haven’t decided if
        you’re the only one who’s worthy for me to grant the ultimate treasure
        to.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer, who was muttering to himself, had another Heroic Spirits in his
        heart. In terms of the degree of attention he had, the interest of the
        King of Heroes was actually all piled upon her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tonight, witnessing with his own eyes that incomparable light lead the
        thoughts of the primeval Heroic Spirit back to the distant past.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        &ndash; Once upon a time, there was a man.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was a foolish and ridiculous fellow whom, despite having a body made
        of mud and soil, set his heart to stand shoulder to shoulder with gods.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, his hubris and disrespectful arrogance offended the gods in
        heaven. The man suffered divine retribution and lost his life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even to this day, the King of Heroes still couldn’t forget the way that
        he passed away with tears streaming down his face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Why are you crying? The King of Heroes had asked. Could it be that, only
        now, you are regretting having taken my side?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">It’s not that &ndash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He had answered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Who would understand you after I die? Who else would march forward by
        your side? My friend… when I think that you will live on all alone
        henceforth, I can’t help but shed tears…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like so, when he saw that man taking his last breath, the incomparable
        king realized &ndash; the way that this man, who was human but wanted to
        surpass humanity, had lived, was even more precious and more brilliant
        than all the treasures he had collected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You fool who stretch your hand towards realms not of men… There is only
        one person in heaven or earth who’s worthy of appreciating your
        destruction, and that is none other than I, Gilgamesh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sink into my embrace, oh you glorious and illusionary men. That is my
        decision.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The golden majestic brilliance disappeared in the night mist, leaving
        only an evil laughter echoing long after.
