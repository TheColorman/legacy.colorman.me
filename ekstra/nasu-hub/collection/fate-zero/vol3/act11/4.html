      <h2 id="calibre_link-22" class="calibre2">-72:37:17</h2>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth hid in the shadows deep inside the abandoned factory and gazed
        at the situation of the battle outside. The thoughts in his heart,
        contrary to the incorrupt preparedness of those knights, were only
        boiling with anxiety.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since the victor remained long undecided, he was getting more fidgety by
        the second with those anxious feelings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Why couldn’t he win?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Saber underestimated Lancer so much, why would Lancer’s spear
        still be unable to hit Saber?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The answer became very clear upon some careful thinking &ndash; that is,
        Lancer is very weak, far more inferior to Saber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, he regretted profoundly for not getting the Heroic
        Spirit Alexander.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It would never have turned out like this had he made the King of
        Conquerors his Servant as he had previously planned. Having his Holy
        Relic stolen at the crucial moment, he had to summon Diarmuid as a
        substitute in a hurry. As long as a first-rate, authentic Master such as
        himself is present, those small disadvantages can be amended even if the
        ranks of the Heroic Spirit were lowered. The parts that the Servant
        lacks in will be amended by his own talent; Lord El-Melloi did indeed
        have such a fearless attitude.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, right now, having lost his Magic Circuits, Kayneth had long
        lost his previous confidence. In order to survive this war with his sole
        remaining Command Seal and an inferior Servant, he had to be even more
        prudent than before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When there is no definite chance of victory, the right thing to do would
        be to immediately escape with the Master. Although he hadn’t gotten
        around asking how Lancer managed to lose Gáe Buidhe, the chances of
        victory against Saber became even more elusive after her left hand had
        healed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now wasn’t the time to stick to battles; Lancer should have other
        duties needing to be prioritized over this. It would be impossible for
        the current Kayneth to search and rescue Sola by himself. It simply
        cannot be done without ordering his Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But &ndash; just how stupid is that Lancer? Can’t he even realize the
        severity of such a situation?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Fretting, Kayneth scratched his head repetitively. How great would it be
        if he could use a Command Seal right now! Why did he just have to have
        only one Command Seal by his hand? It was such a pity for Sola to take
        away two Command Seals. If only she was able to trust Kayneth…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right then, Kayneth’s neck suddenly felt an unnatural flow of air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A piece of paper fluttered down beside him. It was an extremely ordinary
        piece of notepaper, but Kayneth fixed his eyes on the few concise words
        on it with a deadly gaze.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        “&ndash; If you don’t want your beloved one to die, then quietly look
        behind you &ndash;”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        Stunned, Kayneth’s eyes widened, and he moved the wheels of the
        wheelchair to change the direction his body was facing. Deep inside the
        pitch-black abandoned factory, the light coming in through a skylight
        illuminated one single place like a spotlight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The outlines of woman, lying on the floor as if deep asleep, emerged out
        of the dim and cold light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth would never mistake those features no matter how dim the light
        is or how far the distance becomes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the pain and haggardness on Sola’s steel-grey face showed that
        something had evidently occurred, the strand of hair beside her mouth
        quivered as if blown by a breeze. That was the proof of her breathing.
        She was still alive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth forgot the warning on the paper and almost cried out despite
        himself. Then, like a wraith emerging out of the darkness, a human
        figure stepped into the weak light and showed himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An old coat, those untidy hair and listless whiskers, and only those
        pair of eyes, different from the gloomy countenance, fierily emitted a
        razor-sharp light &ndash; that unforgettable man, the only one who had
        cruelly torn apart all the Magic Circuits in Kayneth’s body, that
        hateful flunky of the Einsberns.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had probably transported the unconscious Sola in quietly from the
        back door during the gap formed while Saber and Lancer concentrated in
        fighting each other. The barrel of the submachine gun in the man’s hand
        aimed steadily at Sola’s forehead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“It just has to be… that bastard…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth had experience that viper-like cruelty and seamless prudence
        first-hand. Compared to anger and hatred &ndash; a deep despair that far
        surpassed all other emotions made him hang his head powerlessly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It really was the worse situation he could think of. The woman he loves
        was captured by the most difficult enemy that he didn’t even want to
        imagine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, just before he sank into a panic, the voice of reason stopped
        Kayneth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There must be some purpose for that man to deliberately show himself and
        let Kayneth confirm Sola’s wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth turned his head and cast a glance at Lancer, who was fighting
        with all he had in the abandoned empty area. Judging from the two
        Servants’ position in battle, Sola’s location was a dead spot that they
        can’t see. The two of them were both bent on dealing with the strong
        enemy in front of them, completely ignorant to this new invader.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth couldn’t guess what the man wanted, so he silently inclined his
        head, showing his intention of obeying the other’s wish.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man took a roll of vellum out of his coat and cast it into the air
        after casually opening it. Although the weight of vellum cannot be
        compared to the notepaper beforehand, simple manipulations of air was
        enough to make it fly with the wind. Like a jellyfish, the vellum
        floated across space slowly and leisurely, and landed on Kayneth’s
        knees.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although others would only perceive this as some meaningless figures and
        well-made patterns the things recorded on it was, for Kayneth, a perfect
        magecraft document written in a format that he was familiar with.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &ndash; Only that the content was very rarely seen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Binding magecraft: Target &ndash; Emiya Kiritsugu</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Crests of the Emiya family hereby command: Provided that the
        following conditions are met, this oath shall become a commandment and
        bind the target without exception.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Oath:</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To the fifth head of the Emiya house, Kiritsugu, son of Noritaka:
        regarding both Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald and Sola-Ui Nuada-Re
        Sophia-Ri, all intentions and actions to kill and harm shall be
        forbidden for all eternity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Conditions:</p>
      <p class="calibre3">…………………………</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Self-Geis Scroll &ndash; one of the most merciless contract magecrafts
        that would only be used in the treacherous society of magi when a
        contract that absolutely cannot be disobeyed was to be made.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It is an enforced curse that forcibly uses the functions of one’s own
        Magic Crests upon oneself. Theoretically, it has a power that cannot be
        erased by any method. Even if the caster lost his life, the Magic Crests
        would bind the soul of the dead man and would not pass down the
        generations. It is a very dangerous magecraft. For magi, a parley that
        involves offering such a declaration would in fact mean a maximal
        concession.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it wasn’t something Kayneth often saw, it was indeed proper in
        the way it was written, with no loopholes. The signature made with the
        blood of the declarer himself was evidently pulsing with prana, showing
        that the spell was already established and was currently working.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That is to say &ndash; when the conditions recorded in the bottom half
        of the declaration is fulfilled, that man &ndash; Emiya Kiritsugu will
        give up a part of his free will, and the contract will be confirmed as
        an unbreakable curse.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Holding the vellum with shaking hands, Kayneth read the conditions to
        establish the contract over and over. As if hoping the contents would
        change the next time he reads it, he stubbornly contemplated those words
        repeatedly. He bent his entire will to consider if the contents left any
        gaps that may form contradictions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, different from Kayneth’s wavering thoughts, the most logical
        part of his heart had already accepted his own yielding. The possibility
        that his beloved woman and himself may return to their homeland alive
        &ndash; at this moment, isn’t that his greatest wish?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he hesitated a few more moments, Emiya Kiritsugu would probably pull
        the trigger. After the first bullet took away Sola’s life, the barrel
        would definitely point at Kayneth himself. There were no choices for
        him. Whether to lose everything or to regard that declaration as his
        last hope of life… that was the only difference.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a dim and blank look as if he was an empty shell, he looked at the
        final Command Seal on his right hand and then gave the final unbreakable
        command as Lancer’s Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without a sign, without a reason &ndash; brilliant vermillion scattered
        all over the earth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone appeared to be equally shocked. Saber, Irisviel, and even
        Lancer himself widened their eyes at this overly abrupt end &ndash;
        Lancer’s own shock should probably be the most intense, since he had not
        a sliver of expectation or preparedness for that agony and despair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dazed, Lancer gazed at the crimson flowers that dripped from the red
        spear shaft to the ground. No matter how, he could not believe that it
        was all his own blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His own beloved spear pierced his heart. It was no one else’s but his
        own two hands that forcibly stabbed the spear tip into his own body.
      </p>
      <div class="svg_outer">
        <svg
          height="100%"
          preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"
          version="1.1"

          <image height="1280" width="845" href="../images/000016.png"></image>
        </svg>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, it wasn’t his intention, nor was it his wish. What his
        crimson spear was supposed to pierce was Saber’s heart, and what was
        supposed to pierce his own heart should have been Saber’s holy sword.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Able to rob everything away from him at a whim, regardless of his
        fighting spirit or beliefs &ndash; no such great power exists apart from
        Command Seals.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because Lancer was overly focused on the duel with Saber, he did not
        notice the treaty secretly sealed in the dim abandoned factory beside
        him until the end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        “Use up all the Command Seals, and let the Servant finish himself’”
        &ndash; that was the required condition within the Self-Geis Scroll
        Emiya Kiritsugu brought up. He demanded Kayneth to use up all the
        Command Seals and completely destroy the Servant &ndash; a total retreat
        from the Holy Grail War.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ah…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Crimson tears flew out of Lancer’s wide eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For him, it was already the second time to be murdered by his lord. It
        was precisely because Diarmuid ua Duibhne was bent on overcoming that
        unhappy end that he wished so strongly to return to this world from the
        Throne of Heroes. However, the end that he received was a replay of that
        tragedy &ndash; he only experienced that despair and sorrow once again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heroic Spirit looked behind him with eyes wet with blood and tears.
        Just then, two Masters walked out of the abandoned factory to witness
        his end. They were Kayneth, sitting on his wheelchair with an empty and
        dazed expression and another man, who stood and carried Sola’s comatose
        body in his hands. He was the anonymous true Master of Saber that he saw
        at Einsbern castle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Do you… so…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kneeling in a pool of his own blood, Lancer tried his best to speak with
        a hoarse and low sound.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Do you want victory so much!? Do you want to win the Holy Grail so
        much? Even … willing to trample on my only true wish… you, don’t you
        feel ashamed!?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His beauty twisted with blood and tears, changing into a completely
        different countenance akin to a demon’s. Lancer, forgetting everything
        except hatred, no longer distinguished between friend and foe. Thinking
        of Kiritsugu, Saber, and everything in the world, he roared out a growl
        of vengeance that tore at his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Unforgivable… I’ll never forgive you! You dead men who are slaved by
        fame, and desecrated the glory of knights… let my blood stain that
        dream! I curse the Holy Grail! I curse that your wishes will become
        disasters! When you fall into the burning pits of hell, do not forget
        my, Diarmuid’s, anger!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While he gradually lost his material body and crumpled as a hazy shade,
        he screamed curses until the final moment when he disappeared. There was
        no longer the glorious figure of a Heroic Spirit, but only an evil
        spirit roaring with resentment. Servant Lancer had finally been
        completely eliminated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if at a loss, Kayneth gazed at the blank space left by Lancer’s
        disappearance. Casually, Kiritsugu placed Sola, who was still deep
        asleep, on his knees. As Kayneth softly caressed the haggard sleeping
        face of his beloved, he asked Kiritsugu with a weak voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Then your enforcement has been…?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ahh, it’s established. It’s already impossible to kill you…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu slowly moved back as he took out a cigarette from his pocket
        and lit it &ndash; maybe that was the signal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“For me, that is.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While Kayneth mumbled in a low voice Hisau Maiya, who witnessed
        everything in the shadows far away, silently pulled the trigger of the
        Steyr AUG assault rifle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth and Sola were captured by the aim of the night vision scope and
        were mercilessly exposed to a rain of automatically-fired bullets. For
        the two of them, who have lost the protection of Volumen Hydragyrum and
        had no Servants left in service, the 5.56mm high-speed bullet rain of
        baptism was an inescapable gale of death. In the savage power of the
        bullets that they had so despised in the past, the magus and his
        fiancée’s bodies were torn in pieces and fell to the concrete ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He only doubted if the magecraft of the Self-Geis Scroll was tempered
        with, but missed the trap hidden behind the meaning of the important
        contract. That finally took away the fate of the genius magus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Uuu… Ahhh!!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps Sola, who died from the bullets without pain, was the luckier
        one. Tragically, even after he was transformed into a sieve and fell
        down from the wheelchair, Kayneth still remained breathing. He had been
        dealt many fatal wounds all over his body and had no more hope of
        surviving. However, even if he had only seconds left to live, it would
        be a cruelly long time if it were to be passed by enduring the pain and
        agony of death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Ahhh… Kill… Kill me…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Sorry, that is a contract I can’t fulfill.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu ignored the weak entreating sounds beside his feet, and
        replied with a nonchalant voice as he exhaled the purple smoke that he
        had breathed in.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sound that sobbed with pain didn’t go on. Saber couldn’t bear to
        keep watching and used her sword to cut off Kayneth’s head, ending his
        pain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the end, the King of Knight’s sword did not fulfil the promise made
        with Lancer. On the contrary, it ended up far from faith and glory, and
        was stained with the blood of ending the pain of someone already wounded
        without hope.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Emiya, Kiritsugu &ndash;”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The azure irises burned with a cold fire. They were not eyes used to
        look at friends, nor was it a sight used to face comrades in a broader
        sense. Identical to when she faced Caster’s madness and Archer’s
        arrogance, it was a look sharp as a blade used to pierce those that she
        had recognized as enemies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I finally understand it now; you’re a man without morals. I had
        originally thought that even if our paths differ, our goals are the
        same; but I was far too foolish…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu still remained silent. There was already no need to answer. It
        was because the actions that Saber just witnessed were absolutely
        ‘evil’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Up till now, I’ve believed in Irisviel’s words and never doubted your
        character. However, even if a man like you now says that you’ll save the
        world with the Holy Grail, I won’t believe a word of it anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Answer me, Kiritsugu! Did you deceive even your wife? Just what is the
        true reason that you seek the omnipotent wish-granting vessel?!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“---”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu &ndash; although his eyes stared at Saber as if irritated, the
        mouth that held a cigarette still didn’t speak a word. It was a gaze
        used to look out at a wildly barking stray dog. It merely contained a
        decisive separation that gave up trying to understand each other using
        words from the start.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Within Saber’s heart, there was already a calm and resolute decision
        that almost said ‘he must be killed’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maybe, at the end, the only thing left between her and this master would
        be to face him with her sword. Even if that will be prohibited by the
        Command Seals, this obvious enmity cannot be changed. This might be the
        largest fracture in their camp during the War of the Holy Grail.
        However, no matter what, as long as she’s with Emiya Kiritsugu, it is
        very probable that she won’t be able to obtain the Holy Grail that she
        truly wishes for.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Even if my sword does win the Holy Grail, if I am to entrust the Grail
        to you, then I…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That sunset over Camlann flashed past Saber’s eyes. The wish hidden in
        her heart made her words blur at the end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A sound from behind her interrupted that painful pause.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Answer me, Kiritsugu. No matter what, this time you have the obligation
        to explain.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even Irisviel, who trusted her husband completely, couldn’t help but
        raise her voice in her question.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Different from Saber, she fully knew the way her husband thinks and
        understood him. However, there was a vast difference between the beliefs
        expressed in words and the stunning real actions before her eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She already had a cold premonition that said ‘could it be…?’ in her
        heart when Lancer questioned her about Lord El-Melloi’s fiancée back
        then. However, the conscience in her heart denied that probability. No
        matter what, for him to do something of that degree…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the end, even as his wife, Irisviel had underestimated Kiritsugu’s
        ruthlessness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Speaking of, this is the first time you witnessed my ‘method of
        killing’, Iri.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Changing from the silence that he’s maintained until know, Kiritsugu
        answered with a dry voice. The dim and cold look that he gave to Saber
        shrank back shyly with shame as he turned to Irisviel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Nah, Kiritsugu. Don’t speak to me, speak to Saber. She needs to talk to
        you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “No, I’ve got nothing to say with that Servant. There’s nothing to be
        said to a killer controlled by glory and honor.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He fearlessly spoke words that insulted Saber while maintaining a front
        of speaking to Irisviel. Of course Saber would not leave it alone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Don’t you dare to humiliate chivalry in front of me, you beast!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if faced with the angry yells of the King of Knights, who raised
        her brows in rage, Kiritsugu stayed steady as a rock. He still paid no
        attention to Saber, fixing his gaze on his wife instead. However, at
        this time, he finally started to spill his words out endlessly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Chivalry cannot save the world. It was so in past histories, and it
        will be so in the future. Those people promoted the idea that there is a
        difference of good and evil when it comes to the method of battle, and
        acted on the battlefield as if they have pride. Just because all the
        heroes of the ages were cloaked with that illusion, how many youths do
        you think were deceived by the glory of such courage and finally bled to
        their deaths?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “That’s not an illusion! Even if it’s a matter of life or death, as long
        as it is the action of humans it must have rules and beliefs that allow
        no violation. Righteousness must not be lost! Otherwise, the endless
        flames of war will once again turn this world into hell at the end!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber rebuked righteously. However, Kiritsugu snorted in derision.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “See, just like so &ndash; just like you said, Iri. This great Heroic
        Spirit dares to think that the battlefield is better than hell.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What a joke! No matter in what era, the battlefield has always been a
        veritable hell. In the battlefield, there is no place for hope. What
        lies there is only cold despair and a sin called victory, built on the
        pain of the defeated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All those people who met there have wholeheartedly admitted the evil and
        foolishness of this act called ‘war’. As long as people don’t repent and
        don’t regard it as the most evil taboo, then hell would endlessly
        reappear in the world.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Saber, who only knew the utterly cruel, emotionless Kiritsugu, it
        was the first time she saw Emiya Kiritsugu’s other side &ndash; a man
        almost crushed by endless anguish and sorrow, his monologue that was
        close to lamentation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “However, humans did not realize that truth no matter how high they
        staked their mountains of corpses. That’s because in no matter what era
        the courageous and fearless great heroes have always bedazzled the eyes
        of the multitude with their splendid heroic legends. Because of the
        wistful actions of those idiots and their refusal to admit that
        bloodshed is by itself evil, the essence of humans has stayed on the
        same spot since the Stone Age!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just who was the target of the rage filling those pair of eyes &ndash;
        that was already clear without the need to clarify.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since the day that the flames of war started on the land of Fuyuki,
        Kiritsugu had probably began looking at the shining figures of the
        Heroic Spirits before him, those who prided in courage and resolution,
        with that unendurable rage in his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those who left such heroism, and those who longed for such heroism; the
        anger directed at them and with nowhere to let out… it was a hatred
        toward the overall concept of ‘Heroic Spirits’ that was created due to
        the prayers of men.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; then Kiritsugu, your humiliation of Saber… was it because of
        your hatred towards Heroic Spirits?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “How could it be? I’d never mix in such personal emotions into it. I
        need to win the Holy Grail and save the world. I am only using the most
        suitable method in the processing of fighting for that goal.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he had fought as he had planned before, and if he didn’t capture Sola
        but killed her immediately, then Lancer, whose supply of prana would be
        completely stopped, would naturally disappear. However, what Kiritsugu
        employed was a strategy that completely removed the possibility of a
        Servant, having lost his master, forming a contract with someone else
        and returning to the battlefield. Based on the result of the battle
        against Caster he predicted that Kayneth, who was protected by the
        Fuyuki Church, may obtain extra Command Seals. Therefore, he prepared
        such a twisting and complicated trap.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Relying on the Command Seal of the rival Master to eliminate the
        Servant, and then take out the Master, a complete removal of the
        obstacle… during that time, what he demanded from Saber was not to win
        over Lancer but to distract Lancer’s attention while Kiritsugu convinced
        Kayneth, acting only as a decoy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The world as it is, the human nature as always, it is impossible to
        eliminate battles. In the end, killing is necessarily evil. If so, it is
        best to end them in the maximum efficiency and at the least cost, least
        time. If you want to slander that as foul and demean that as nasty, then
        do as you wish. Justice cannot save the world. I have no interest in
        things like that.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber recalled Lancer’s final, disappearing eyes filled of anger. Then,
        she stared at the tragic remains of the man and woman, collapsed in a
        puddle of blood, and the expression of anguish carved on their faces,
        and spoke.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Even so, you &ndash;”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Saber was about to speak her thoughts, she suddenly found that her
        own voice was lower and calmer than she thought it would be. She had
        just realized that her complicated emotions towards Kiritsugu was no
        longer her previous anger, but had to changed to some kind of pity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That’s right; maybe he is a man that should be pitied.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Isn’t he himself that needed salvation, not this world?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Emiya Kiritsugu, I don’t know what kind of betrayal you were
        subjected to in the past and why you despaired. But that rage, that
        lament, are undoubtedly things that those who pursued justice possesses.
        Kiritsugu, in your youth you should have wanted to be ‘a hero of
        justice’. You should have believed in and wanted to become a hero who
        saves the world more than anyone else &ndash; isn’t that so?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Until now, the only attitudes Kiritsugu had shown to Saber were complete
        ignorance and cold scorn. But now, Kiritsugu, having heard Saber’s quiet
        questioning &ndash; the eyes that he fixed on his Servant showed other
        emotions for the first time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">It was a rage seemingly close to boiling over.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        The sound of car exhaust disturbed the silence of dawn. Then, the small
        truck that Hisau Maiya drove entered the yard of the abandoned factory
        with bright headlights on. She should be here to take Kiritsugu back to
        Shinto after concluding her duty as a sniper.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu took his eyes off Saber and walked towards the small truck,
        not even turning around, and opened the passenger side door. Saber was
        still speaking to his back. There was something that she had to say no
        matter what.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Kiritsugu… do you understand? If you commit evil due to your hatred of
        evil, at the end all that’s left will be evil. The rage and hatred that
        sprouted forth there will cause new wars once again.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Faced with Saber’s heavy words, it was as if Kiritsugu had the intention
        to reply for the first time and wanted to turn around &ndash; however,
        he changed his mind at last, and said while staring at the empty air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I will stop the endless cycles. That’s why I need the Holy Grail.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Indeed, as if talking to himself, he said loudly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I’ll use this miracle to complete the revolution of this world, the
        revolution of all human souls. I will make the blood shed within Fuyuki
        city as the final bloodshed of all human beings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For that, even if I am to carry ‘all the evils of this world’ &ndash; it
        won’t matter. If that can save the world, then I’d gladly accept it.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu spoke the decision in his heart with such a calmness and
        evenness that even Saber could not find any words to reply to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if his method and path were unendurably evil &ndash; his faith in
        seeking the Holy Grail was pure and selfless. She had to admit that if
        there was a Master in the war worthy of obtaining the Holy Grail, then
        he would undoubtedly be Emiya Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wordlessly, Saber watched the departure of the small truck that
        Kiritsugu rode. The first ray of dawn shone beside her. The dark night
        that made Fuyuki into a demonic realm had departed, and the streets once
        again put on the mask of ‘ordinary’ beneath the sunlight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Is Kiritsugu… gone already?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; Irisviel?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since Saber had the time to think about the oddities in the question,
        she was unable to immediately detect Irisviel’s strangeness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That empty and wondering gaze, the pallid face, and the sweat pouring
        down from her forehead like a waterfall…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She was probably just forcing herself while she was beside her husband
        and pretended that there was nothing wrong. Irisviel fainted as soon as
        she relaxed, and collapsed as if she was a puppet cut loose from her
        strings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Saber immediately moved up and held her, the strange heat
        coming from the slender body in her arms made her realize that Irisviel
        was already in a critical condition.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Irisviel!? Hang on!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre6">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the resolute and bold way that Emiya Kiritsugu declared his
        determination so loudly that morning, it could be seen that they were
        truly words from his heart without any falsity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But just what those incredible, ominous words meant at the end &ndash;
        Kiritsugu finally understood it clearly a few days later.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">In a despair even deeper than despair.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">In a regret even deeper than regret.</p>
