      <p class="calibre3">
        "You&mdash;useless fellow! Trash that only knows how to boast!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer could only quietly lower his head and silently endure the
        ferocious scolding.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You were only to protect a woman temporarily. But you could not even do
        it; this is preposterous! So this is the stuff a so-called knight is
        made of!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth was currently cursing, spit flying everywhere. But from the
        extent of disconcertment, compared to Lancer who forgot himself out of
        shame, Kayneth was actually even more out of things. Because of his
        naturally stubborn personality, now the extent of Lord El-Melloi’s anger
        was filled with righteous indignation to the point of being
        fear-inducing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth had obtained a new Command Seal; satisfied, he had returned to
        the abandoned factory that he used as a hiding place, and found that
        there was in fact no sign of Sola there. Logically speaking, at this
        time she should already have ended the battle with Caster and returned
        here. He had waited in a state of anxiety brought on by worry, and
        waited until&mdash;the solitary return of Lancer, whose expression was
        serious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Though it was only a temporary substitution, Sola was undoubtedly your
        Master, was she not! You actually do not have the ability to guard her
        till the end&mdash;why did you become a Servant? How can you be so
        shameless as to return alone!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...I truly do not have the dignity to return."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then you&mdash;in the battle with Caster, was it also your foolish
        childishness that encouraged you to neglect the protection of your
        Master, focusing only on displaying that foolish heroism of yours?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer weakly shook his head. His natural beauty was twisted by sorrow;
        this meant that he was also remorseful of this hateful outcome. But now
        Kayneth did not have the time to notice this at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Master, please allow me... Because Sola-sama and I did not make an
        official contract, we cannot even feel each other’s presence...”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It is precisely because of this that you should have been even more
        careful, even more attentive!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth immediately shouted, cutting off his Servant’s explanation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Usually for a Master and Servant who had made a contract, no matter
        which party had fallen into danger, it would be communicated to the
        other. In truth, in the Einsbern forest, it was in this way that Lancer
        had saved Kayneth from the emergency circumstances.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But this time, because Lancer and Sola had in fact entered the battle
        without forming an official contract according to the laws of contract
        thaumaturgy, Lancer had only protected Sola out of his duty to Kayneth;
        this had also become a cause of the disaster.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the end, by the time Lancer had ended the battle and returned to the
        rooftop of the building in central Fuyuki, Sola, who had originally
        stayed there, had long disappeared; only the bloodstains splattered over
        the floor were any hint as to the seriousness of the occurrence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only thing that could be confirmed was that Sola was still alive.
        The prana supply that allowed Lancer to remain in this world and that
        provided him with the strength to act was still flowing unobstructed
        into his body. Undoubtedly, she had been kidnapped, but the instigator
        did not seem to intend to take her life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it had been another Servant, perhaps it would be possible to sense
        her approximate location by the path of the prana supply. But
        unfortunately, because the contract which Lancer had made was not a
        standard one&mdash;the contractor and supplier of prana were two
        different people, his ability to sense the supplier of prana was clearly
        extremely weak. Even if he could determine that Sola was still alive,
        but where the prana came from, he could not sense at all. With no leads,
        searching for Sola in the city was almost like searching for a needle in
        the haystack. In the end, he had had to return alone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ahah, Sola... indeed I should not have passed the Command Seals to
        her... a magecraft battle would truly have overloaded her..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In not advising Sola-sama otherwise, I am also responsible. But
        Sola-sama made that decision purely because she wished that you, Sir
        Kayneth, could regain your standing. In that case, no matter what,
        please&mdash;"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth raised his eyes, clouded with jealousy, and stared at Lancer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You still have the gall to speak thus. Don’t act stupid, Lancer, it
        must have been you who encouraged Sola."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You... why would you draw such a conclusion..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmph, stop pretending! In the stories of legend, you are fairly well
        known for womanizing and adultery. Were you not involuntarily intending
        to seduce your master’s fiancée?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kneeling on the floor with his head lowered, Lancer’s shoulders were
        shaking violently, almost dangerously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "&mdash;&mdash;My master, no matter what you must take back those
        words."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hn, hit a nerve? You cannot endure this anger? In that case, you are
        intending to show me your true face of ferocity?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth continued to mock the Heroic Spirit who could barely control his
        own emotions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You’ve finally slipped up. On one hand you swear eternal loyalty to me,
        speaking pretty words; on the other hand, driven by lust, you betray me.
        You always spoke of knighthood with a proud expression; do you think
        that would be enough to mislead me&mdash;Kayneth?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Sir Kayneth... you... why do you not understand my loyalty?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer’s sobbed. The somewhat quivering inquiry was almost plaintive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "All I wanted was to defend the honor I have always had! I only want to
        participate with you in glorious battles! Master, why do you not
        understand the heart of a knight?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Stop saying these insolent things, Servant!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth mercilessly snapped at Lancer’s plea with a ruthless expression.
        The suspicion of and dissatisfaction with his Servant had at this point
        already passed boiling point in his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Presumptuous puppet. No matter what you are only a Servant. You are
        only a shadow that can stay in the real world through magical means! The
        glory and pride you speak of is only a trick that the spirits of the
        dead use to confuse the people of the world. Furthermore you are
        actually insolent enough to the point of lecturing your Master; know the
        limits to your audacity!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because what Kayneth had said was too much, Lancer was speechless.
        Kayneth, seeing Lancer’s expression, secretly felt a sadistic pleasure.
        Seizing the opportunity, he stretched his right arm, on which the image
        of the Command Seals had once again been carved, towards Lancer; the
        magus proudly laughed loudly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you are dissatisfied, then try using that pride and honor of which
        you speak to withstand my Command Seals&mdash;hm, no match? This then is
        your true ability. The spirit and fortitude of which you speak are not
        even worth mentioning in the presence of the Command Seals. Those are
        the real tricks of puppets such as Servants, then.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Kayneth... sir..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing Kayneth who was loudly mocking him, Lancer weakly lowered his
        head, unable to make any sort of rebuttal. The previous majesty of
        brandishing the twin lances in the presence of warlords had long since
        vanished without a trace; whether from weakly slumped shoulders, or the
        unfocused eyes staring at the ground, it was impossible to see any trace
        of heroism.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at his miserable likeness, Kayneth finally felt that he had
        vented all the grievances he had been continuously accumulating, and
        felt slightly relieved.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps up till now, Kayneth had finally been able to establish his
        ideal master-servant relationship with this Heroic Spirit. Though it was
        somewhat late; he should have been able to, at an earlier
        time&mdash;preferably immediately after summoning&mdash;completely
        strike down his pride. If this had been done earlier, this presumptuous
        Servant would probably not have had other intentions, and served him
        compliantly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"&mdash;&mdash;Master."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a long silence, Lancer suddenly called to Kayneth in a cold voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What is it? Is there anything you still have to say?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...That is not my intention. There appears to be something closing in
        on us. It is probably the sound of an engine equipped with an automatic
        drive."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though Kayneth did not hear anything. But the hearing of ordinary people
        was greatly unable to compare with that of a Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A motorcar which, at almost daybreak, drove in this direction with this
        abandoned factory as its target, definitely could not be simply passing
        by.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Come to think of it, at the time of deciding this place as a stronghold,
        the camouflage enchantments he had set up in the surroundings had almost
        reached the point of revealing weak points... Kayneth sneered at himself
        who was no longer a magus, and surfaced a dry smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Lancer, go immediately to destroy it. Do not stay your hand."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Understood."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer nodded, immediately shifted into spirit form, and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre6">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to the directions that Irisviel, who was sitting in the front
        passenger seat, was giving, the Mercedes-Benz 300SL that Saber was
        driving had gradually left Shinto, moved east, and come to a deserted
        area.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you follow this road straight, on the left hand side there is an
        abandoned factory. There... appears to be the stronghold of Lancer and
        the rest."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The location of the factory and the route to take had all been told to
        Irisviel over the phone by Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the intense battle not far from the river, one could guess that
        Lancer, who had left the battlefield without a word, would probably have
        returned to his Master’s side. Upon hearing that Kiritsugu had gotten
        hold of a report as to Lancer’s whereabouts, Saber proposed to act
        immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Come to think of it... are you all right? Wouldn’t consecutive battles
        be a great burden to you?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No problem, Irisviel. On the other hand, I hope to be able to face off
        against Lancer tonight."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After somberly announcing this, this time it was Saber who flanked
        worriedly at the passenger seat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You, on the other hand, Irisviel, are you all right? You did not look
        too well just now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While operating the steering wheel, Saber looked at Irisviel beside her.
        Saber discovered at a glance that Irisviel’s face was pale and
        bloodless, and that she was constantly wiping cold sweat from her
        forehead. Ever since leaving the riverside, she had been like this.
        Though she was trying her best to hide it, observers could tell at a
        glance that she was exerting herself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Don’t worry, Saber. As long as you are by my side...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ah, look. That building. That should be it."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A long time ago, when the city had not yet been depicted as an emerging
        residential area, this was probably a place used for something like
        lumber. The location that had been abandoned by developing trends,
        forgotten by emergent flourishing streets, quietly stood in the heart of
        a small hilly area overgrown with lallang.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Slowly passing through the front door and into empty ground, Saber
        turned off the car’s engine. The surroundings were quiet; Irisviel,
        standing outside the car, warily eyed the situation around, then nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "&mdash;Indeed there are traces of magecraft enchantments. But what is
        strange is that they do not seem to be carefully managed; they are
        already showing flaws."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"No, it is this place. Irisviel."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber, who had gotten out of the car a little later, asserted with a
        calm expression. This highly skilled swordswoman had probably long
        sensed through sharp senses the scent of battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Indeed&mdash;as if to prove Saber’s pronouncement true, in front of the
        silent abandoned land suddenly appeared a handsome figure holding a
        lance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You were actually able to find this place&mdash;it must not have been
        easy, Saber."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After investigating, my&mdash;partner told me this was your
        stronghold."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The word ‘Master’ had almost issued forth from her lips, but she
        ultimately had not said it in the end&mdash;this showed the minute wave
        of emotion of which even Saber herself had not been aware. Of course, in
        principle it was for the sake of concealing the reality of who her true
        Master really was. But, the most fundamental reason was still that
        subconsciously, she did not wish to admit that Kiritsugu was her master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer’s expression was grave, very different from usual, hesitating for
        a long time as if choosing words in his mind, then asking the visitor a
        question.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Where is my master’s fiancée? ... Saber, you will not say that you do
        not know?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber’s and Irisviel’s expressions both turned troubled; they looked at
        each other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I do not know&mdash;what happened?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Nothing. Pretend I never asked."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer sighed lengthily; the amount of relief it contained was far
        greater than disappointment. Originally he had not intended to ask Saber
        this question. That the one who was his rival would use such underhanded
        means as kidnapping a hostage&mdash;just thinking about it, Lancer found
        it detestable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "&mdash;Come to think of it, Saber, are you all right? I do not think it
        was to chat with me that you came here. But didn’t you expend a lot of
        energy in the battle against Caster?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Regarding this, I think the other Servants are the same."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber passed over the matter as if it were inconsequential. It was
        indeed as she had said; in the battle with Caster at the riverside,
        every Servant had expended a great deal of prana.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So I predicted that tonight no one would initiate an attack, instead
        taking the defensive stance&mdash;precisely because of this, there is no
        need to worry that tonight’s battle will be intruded upon by people who
        have nothing to do with it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber, whose entire body was overflowing with a calm fighting spirit,
        stepped forward. Her slender, small body nevertheless evoked the
        impression of majesty; this aura, accompanied by the splendidly radiant
        armor formed of dazzling prana, enveloped her entire body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It is already almost dawn... There is still some time in the night; if
        this great opportunity were to be missed, we do not know in which month
        of which year we will have another opportunity to face off without a
        care. I do not think this opportunity should be missed&mdash;what do you
        think? Lancer."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer, whose usually handsome expression had been lost to the worries
        of his heart, now finally smiled slightly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Saber... now the only thing that can bring a cool and refreshing wind
        to my heart, is this pure will of yours to fight."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In reality, a while ago Saber had also been secretly surprised as to why
        Lancer had lost his previous majesty. Until she had seen his smile and
        discovered that her worries were unnecessary. A man with such a smile
        clearly did not require concern or worry of any kind. That sort of smile
        was one that only people who had overcome all difficulties and were
        steadfast in their beliefs could have.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer brandished the red lance as if wishing to chase away all the
        worries and laments in his heart; the point was directed at Saber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber also released the Barrier of the Wind King; the precious golden
        sword was revealed amidst the whirlwind. Facing Diarmuid’s Gáe Dearg,
        using air pressure to conceal the blade of the sword was meaningless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And the most important thing was, the King of Knights believed that this
        rival originally from another time but that she had coincidentally met
        in this world was a Heroic Spirit worthy to accept the light of the
        sword in which she had accumulated all her glory that shone upon him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The morning light was lucent, the sky a faint red; all the fighting
        spirits concentrated between the two Servants was silently and anxiously
        on the offensive. If one’s senses were especially sensitive, just
        standing in the middle of the whirlpool of their wills would make one
        feel pain as if having been hit; perhaps it would even induce a heart
        attack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Every cell in Irisviel’s body shuddered with the anticipation of a
        lethal blow; to say nothing of the aura, even the circulation of her
        blood was stagnated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then&mdash;both parties stepped forward at the same time with spirits
        majestic as the rainbow in the sky, and the clashing sounds were clear
        as ripping cloth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two heroes who had not had a chance to battle these three days,
        tonight finally had the chance to face off; an intense battle would once
        again occur.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The situation of battle tonight&mdash;on one hand was a re-enactment of
        the showdown at the warehouses, but the battle of their crossing swords
        was even more intense than the first&mdash;fiercer, more direct, more
        final; it was a direct clash of strength on strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Between the two there was no need for mutual evaluation, nor the use of
        tricks to confuse the other. Lancer held only one lance right from the
        beginning; the blade of Saber’s sword was also completely revealed.
        Neither used means of plots and tricks. Even faster, even more imposing.
        After one made a move, the other would immediately retaliate at full
        strength with a blow that would counter the first. A simple contest of
        skill, blade of sword against point of lance, even more intense, even
        more white-hot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The holy sword intertwined with the demonic lance, in direct opposition;
        the sparks flying were simply dazzling. The clash between the precious
        artifacts of legend, driven by strength and speed far beyond that of a
        human, passed the speed of sound, nearing the speed of light.
        Observation had long since lost meaning in this momentous battle. Those
        divine skills, pushed to the limits at the point of this fierce battle,
        were having a supreme contest between the two.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An unknown number of rounds had been fought; perhaps tens of rounds,
        perhaps hundreds of rounds. It was simply impossible to determine with a
        mortal eye. After the lance and sword of the two clashed, they finally
        separated, and moved away from each other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Saber, you&mdash;"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer had just started speaking, but was unable to continue, his face
        an expression of anguish and confusion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tonight, though Saber’s swordplay had changed only slightly, but it was
        indeed lighter in strength than the first time and somewhat held back.
        Lancer would not have been unable to notice this. This was not due to
        the expenditure of Saber’s physical strength, but it was that her
        swordplay itself had changed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber held tightly onto her left thumb, tucked into her palm, in
        actuality not grasping her sword. The remaining four fingers were
        lightly wrapped around the sword; in controlling her sword, her left
        hand was used only for support. When attacking, the strength of her left
        hand was not used at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It had clearly been Saber who had taken the initiative to pronounce her
        intention of facing off, but she deliberately did not use her left hand,
        only using the right to hold the sword of gold.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, Lancer understood the reason behind this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Indeed, Lancer had once used the demonic lance Gáe Buidhe to seal the
        strength of Saber’s left hand, but in the battle against Caster last
        night, Lancer had destroyed the cursed yellow lance, proactively giving
        up the advantageous lead. But Saber’s pride would not settle for
        accepting Lancer’s concession, and so she intentionally did not use her
        left hand. This, then, was an action of true chivalry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But&mdash;even that concession that was noble enough to inspire
        instantaneous respect&mdash;Lancer did not welcome this action from his
        heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the action of casting away Gáe Buidhe had caused Saber unnecessary
        concern.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the final result, it meant that Lancer’s actions had dampened the
        enthusiasm of the showdown between the two. It was a battle in which
        both parties did not have any regrets, and used all their strength to
        face off, that Lancer had hoped for. If Saber had held back because she
        could not put aside her consideration of the fairness of circumstance,
        Lancer was truly somewhat uneasy about the battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "&mdash;If you misunderstand, I will be very troubled. Lancer."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if having guessed what Lancer was thinking, Saber shook her head with
        a stern but calm expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If I were to use my left hand, my shame would definitely slow my sword.
        Facing your superb skills with the lance, this would be a fatal
        mistake."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Saber..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, Diarmuid, this is really the best strategy I use in order to put
        all my strength into bringing you down."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber said resolutely, Holding the sword with one hand was indeed
        somewhat heavy; Saber lowered the sword slightly, and assumed her
        stance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Shining in her eyes was only an awe-inspiring, coolly clear will to
        fight. There was no carelessness, nor was there hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps to her, the extent of the injury to her left hand was only of
        secondary importance in battle. Perhaps the most important contributor
        to Saber’s ability to obtain victory was in the clear fighting spirit
        and passion for battle that had been honed to purity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To sever her confusion, she would rather give up her left hand&mdash;the
        pride hidden in her heart, then, was her greatest weapon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It is this in which the King of Knights is most noble.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber now undoubtedly had embraced the resolution of fighting to the
        death. She also wished to face off with Lancer to her heart’s content
        under conditions like these&mdash;after understanding her intentions,
        Lancer felt something intense and also freeing, as if having been
        shocked by electricity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Glory shines from within the sword of the King of Knights. It is truly
        great that I have been able to meet you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The path that the two anticipated was the same.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it was a narrow bridge on which it was not possible to give way to
        each other, the person who took a step first must be respectfully seen
        off from behind by the other who had fallen back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Precisely thus&mdash;was this without worry, without distraction, in
        which lives were risked, the exploration and pursuit of lance and sword,
        a battle of true worth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The expressions of the two were both extremely anxious and serious, but
        at the corner of their lips hung the hint of a smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Head knight of the Knights of Fianna, Diarmuid ua
        Duibhne&mdash;attacks!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That is well. King of Britain, Arturia Pendragon meets
        battle&mdash;&mdash;!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two closed in once again, white blades clashing, sparks flying; from
        its midst could be seen the joy of those to whom battle is the meaning
        for their living, shining brightly.
