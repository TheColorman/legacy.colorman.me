      <p class="calibre3">
        From the rooftop of the centre building of Shinto which was far away,
        Sola was observing the figure of the giant sea monster which was
        swallowed by a blinding white light and gradually disappeared, in the
        night fog at the other side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Her vision was already obscured in that fog, moreover from such a
        distance away, she could not follow up the progress of the fight with
        her naked eyes. She did not prepare any familiar which could be
        immediately used for scouting purposes in this situation, so she had no
        choice but to gaze at the riverbank at which the giant sea monster and
        fighter jets were dancing wildly, whilst worrying over it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Anyway, the battle had apparently completed its first stage, but the
        Command Seals on her right hand was still there. That would mean that
        Lancer was still remaining in battle in good health.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Thank God……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although she was being hit by strong gusts of wind which raged at the
        high windswept place, Sola was relieved for now. Lancer would probably
        bring good news back soon. If his victory was shared with other
        Servants, Masters apart from Sola would also receive the incentive of
        additional Command Seals, but that was something trivial. Now, she was
        happy at merely regaining the three strokes of the Command Seals binding
        her to her Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the noise of the blowing wind was absent, Sola would probably sense
        the presence of an attacker stealing up to her back unnoticed from the
        stairs earlier. Preoccupied with the battlefield at the other side, she
        let her guard down. But for the lady who did not even have the knowledge
        of self-defense, much less combat training, there is no way she could
        not be blamed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly she tripped. Even after she ended up on the concrete floor with
        her face up, she did not even have the time to grasp what had happened.
        She reflexively held out her right hand to seek help, but it was grabbed
        by someone roughly. Nevertheless, that person obviously did not have the
        slightest intention of helping Sola, who had fallen. Instead, a blow of
        excruciating pain struck her wrist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Aaa―”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the surface of her fine and slender wrist, like a broken tap, fresh
        blood gushed forth.. Sola stared at attentively in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Her right hand was not there.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With just a blow, it was cut off cleanly. The fingers and nails which
        she prided in and never fail to take care, and also the Command Seals
        which were more valuable than anything else, disappeared altogether from
        Sola’s right arm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Above the pain and the chill of losing her blood, the all the more
        desperate sense of loss dyed Sola’s thinking pitch black.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Aa, aaaa, aaaaahhhhhh! AAAAAAHHHH!!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Whilst letting out a deranged scream, Sola crawled about on the floor,
        trying to find the whereabouts of her disappeared right hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre5"
          >No! It’ll be troublesome if I don’t have THAT. I can’t call Diarmuid.
          I won’t be cared for by Diarmuid.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Worse come to worst, she would spend all the strokes and command him to
        “Love me!”, and that should be able to bind him. That’s why she was
        troubled at her right hand. Whatever the case, even at the price of her
        life, she would retrieve those Command Seals……
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nevertheless, no matter how much she searched on the cold concrete
        floor, apart from her splattered blood, there was nothing else ― After
        that, the tips of a pair of boots which were indifferent-looking and not
        moving, could be seen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the midst of her blurring vision due to heavy losses of blood, still
        prostrate on the floor, Sola looked up and saw an unfamiliar
        black-haired lady. Not even displaying any emotion, much less pity, that
        lady expressionlessly looked down at Sola, who was going to faint.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Hand……My…hand……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With her remaining left hand, she grabbed the lady’s boots, clinging
        onto it &ndash; after which she lost consciousness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without any lingering affection, Hisau Maiya tossed away the female
        magus’ right hand which she severed with all her might using a survival
        knife. Using proper methods, the engraved Command Seals left on her left
        wrist could probably be recovered, but because Maiya did not have such
        technique at this time, it was completely valueless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya quickly tied the right wrist to prevent further loss of blood,
        after which she lifted the unconscious target onto her shoulder, and
        with her other empty hand, rang up Emiya Kiritsugu with her mobile
        phone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre5">- What’s wrong, Maiya?”</i>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I have secured Sola Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri at Shinto. The Command Seals
        were cut off with her right hand, but her condition is not critical.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre5"
          >“Okay. Leave that place quickly. Lancer would probably return
          soon.”</i
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Roger.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After getting the bare minimum conversation over with and cutting off
        the phone call, Maiya dashed down the stairs quickly and reached the
        lower floor. In the homunculus rib bone which was transplanted by means
        of Irisviel’s hands, there was still a dull pain since it had yet to
        familiarize itself with her body, but as for her movements, there was no
        problem at all. Thanks to that, just like before she was injured, Maiya
        trailed Lancer and his new Master, and managed to grab the golden
        opportunity of capturing Sola during Lancer’s absence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sure enough, Kiritsugu’s conjecture was right, but as before, he still
        viewed Kayneth who had lost his rights as Master, as the target he
        should annihilate. Kiritsugu’s policy is to be cautious against the ones
        who were chosen as Masters, even if they were to lose their Command
        Seals.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His real intention for ordering Maiya to capture Sola alive should be to
        question her about Kayneth’s hiding place. The interrogation would
        certainly be a cruel experience for Sola, but even if it were the case,
        there would be no sympathy or mercy from Maiya.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the situation of men fighting against men, cruelty was not something
        uncommon. Even Maiya herself understood that simple fact as it is, much
        less Kiritsugu.
      </p>

      <p class="calibre3">
        The tranquility of late night accompanying the night streets of Shinto
        seemed so far away, as ambulance and patrol cars traveled to and fro
        continually. To those people who rushed about whilst flashing their
        emergency lights, they would probably not understand what situation had
        forced them to rush about in the dead of the night, nor the entire
        picture of the situation. Perhaps they would not understand it even
        during tomorrow or henceforth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The shadow of a tall man in the clothing of a priest walking alone on
        the footpath late at night, would sufficiently be a target of
        questioning as a suspicious person under normal circumstances, but
        tonight they were virtually worked to death due to receipt of successive
        requests for help and instructions for blockades, so there is no way
        they have the time to even be concerned about an ordinary pedestrian.
        Amongst the patrol cars which passed Kotomine Kirei countless times, not
        even one paid any attention to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Kirei who was silently hurrying back to Fuyuki Church, caught in a
        deep thought within his mind, he did not spare any thoughts at all for
        the chaos of the city from which the remains of the mayhem had yet to
        subside.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Always faithful to the instructions, obedient to the responsibilities,
        strict with his ethics. Kirei had strived that hard until today. His
        conducts were always above the need to be doubted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Which is exactly why &ndash; this was the first time he had the
        perplexity of not being able to surmise the meaning behind his actions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, Kirei would rush to Tōsaka Tokiomi’s fights with the
        intention of providing backup for his teacher &ndash; but the moment he
        saw that Tokiomi’s opponent was Matō Kariya, Kirei chose not to join him
        as reinforcements, but merely to hide in the shades; an action
        tantamount to sabotage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was certainly true that he knew the difference in strength between
        Tokiomi and Kariya, and that the situation rendered things like
        assistance meaningless in the first place. So even if he was to only
        stand beside the fight as a spectator, one could say that his decision
        was in line with his principles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nevertheless, his actions after that, were a complete deviation from his
        duty,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The instant Tokiomi caused Kariya to fall from the rooftop of the
        apartment, as if recognizing it as a complete victory, he did not even
        check his enemy’s corpse. Though half-shocked by his teacher’s audacity,
        Kirei went to look for Kariya’s body as a follow-up…… When he saw that
        figure prostrate on the back alley not long after, Kariya was still
        breathing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Naturally, if he was the hound of the Tōsaka camp, delivering the final
        blow swiftly was an obvious duty. In spite of that, the thing going to
        and from Kirei’s mind then, was the contents of the conversation he had
        with Archer this morning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Kotomine Kirei wants to understand himself, not just Emiya Kiritsugu
        &ndash; no, prioritizing over Kiritsugu, he should observe Matō Kariya’s
        fate &ndash; that was the advice given to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Generally, that was an unpleasant conversation. A joke not deserving his
        time to be listened to.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But still, with Tokiomi and Kariya’s showdown before him, what on earth
        had caused Kirei to choose the action of standing beside as a spectator?
        There was no need for him to stay there if he had decided that
        assistance was unnecessary. Wasn’t it more meaningful for him to seek
        the other Masters?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And then, the instant the flames Tokiomi created caught Kariya…… The
        thing which was on his mind, wasn’t it the feeling of dejection?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he suddenly noticed what he was doing, Kirei had already begun
        administering first-aid curative magecraft onto Kariya’s body. Carrying
        Kariya, whose condition had become stable despite in a deep sleep due to
        his actions, he left the battlefield, and left him in front of the Matō
        residence whilst stealthily concealing himself from public gaze &ndash;
        That happened about 15 minutes ago.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The carvings of the Command Seals were still on Kariya’s hand. Kirei did
        not watch the battle at the Mion River until the end, but no matter how
        much injury was inflicted, Berserker was apparently still alive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Whilst covering the long distance from Miyama Town to the outskirts of
        Shinto at a slow pace, during that journey which passed through Fuyuki
        City, Kirei was still distressed over the self-question from which no
        answer came out &ndash; Why the heck had he done such a thing?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was completely different from his buying and storing up wines of
        which the taste he knew not. That was not an action completely deprived
        of benefits. Until now, Kirei had also done secret things without
        Tokiomi’s permission, and also giving false reports repeatedly at times,
        but those were not something which could directly obstruct Tokiomi. His
        hope of a confrontation with Emiya Kiritsugu and Tokiomi’s possession of
        the Holy Grail &ndash; those were not conflicting things.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Notwithstanding that, his prolonging the life of Matō Kariya who had
        been prowling after Tokiomi as a nemesis, had unmistakably turned him
        into Tokiomi’s foe. An act of treason with no excuses allowed. In the
        state of not even having a definite purpose, he had perpetrated
        something preposterous. Tonight, Kirei had clearly crossed the line of
        being a loyal servant of Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was conscious of the gravity of his action, why did Kirei
        not have a tinge of regret within his heart, but instead inexplicable
        exhilaration?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer &ndash; had he been tricked by that King of Heroes heroic spirit?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to his walking feet, his mind was extremely worn out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, Kirei had a rare notion of wanting to talk to his father
        Risei. While he is honest to Kirei in all aspects, he is a father who
        would never be able to understand Kirei’s worries. Nevertheless, come to
        think of it, didn’t Kirei not have a heart to heart talk with his father
        before?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if he would end up making his father deeply disappointed, if he
        would just speak out his mind without any fear &ndash; while his
        relationship with his father would definitely change, won’t that provide
        something completely new to Kirei?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With this vague anticipation in his heart, shelving his worry for the
        time being, Kirei continued walking into the night.
