      <p class="calibre3">
        To Father Risei, supervisor of the fourth Heaven's Feel, this was truly
        an extremely tiring night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was the second time he had assumed the office of supervisor of the
        Heaven's Feel, but he had never dreamed that a situation so difficult to
        deal with would arise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Precisely because of the large scale of the series of problems that had
        arisen, in order to eliminate evidence, not only the Holy Church, but
        even the Magi's Association was also acting in secret. To both sides of
        these two large groups, the situation had already developed to a point
        that - rather than quarrelling amongst themselves and defining their
        respective spheres of influence, they had to prioritize on considering
        how to pick up the pieces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the surface, the strange incident not far from the Mion River was
        attributed to poisonous gases produced by chemical reactions caused by
        industrial waste--this report could temporarily deceive the public. The
        patrolling media truck was also constantly broadcasting that inhaling
        the toxic fumes could cause hallucinations, and that people living along
        the shores should hasten to the hospital for treatment. Of course, all
        the hospitals that could conduct diagnostics at night had already been
        infiltrated by magi and Executors skilled in brainwashing through the
        power of suggestion; they were currently anxiously awaiting orders. It
        should be possible to thus eliminate the majority of witness statements,
        but not the source of rumors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The procedure for purchasing two F15 fighter machines from Middle
        Eastern weapon merchants had just been completed; this was the result of
        the Clock Tower playing the middle man. Though it was a second-hand
        C-model plane, at this critical point there really was absolutely no
        time to take this into account. The two F15s, on which the flag of Japan
        had been temporarily painted, would be delivered to the fortified air
        base; all that's left is to take the opportunity to exchange
        incompatible parts, and then assemble the J-model fighter plane.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Japanese self-defence force was certainly a group restless with
        budget. A single fighter plane already cost over a billion yen, and now
        that a scandal involving losing two fighters simultaneously had
        occurred, this truth needed to be annihilated no matter what. From this
        point on, they could only use pre-prepared replacement fighters used as
        bait for negotiations, and get the self-defence forces to take the
        responsibility of destroying evidence as well.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was already late at night when the endless telephone negotiations
        finally stopped and he could rest for a while, but Risei immediately
        remembered the guest waiting in the main hall. Sighing, he pulled over a
        chair and began his work anew, continuing to carry out his duties as
        supervisor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I am truly sorry to have made you wait. I have been rather busy
        tonight."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In Risei's voice there was an exhaustion that could not be hidden.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the dimly lit pews came the sound of somewhat artificial laughter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's unavoidable. You have urgent matters to attend to."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A light, metallic squeaking sound of the wheelchair's wheels rolling
        along accompanied that laughter. The silhouette that emerged from the
        darkness remained seated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The silhouette, so wan almost as if he was a completely different person
        and could not even stand to walk, was actually the once-famous prodigy
        Kayneth El-Melloi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Who among those knowing his past circumstances would have thought that
        he would have been reduced to such a condition? But in his eyes was a
        strong willpower that could be called obsession from which the stubborn,
        intolerant personality of the former prodigy magus could be vaguely
        perceived.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Kayneth had sustained great physical injuries that made it
        almost impossible to re-establish his glory, he had more or less
        retained the use of his hands through the contacts of the El-Melloi
        clan, exchanging an astonishing sum of money in gratitude to make a deal
        with a doll-maker residing in Japan, and through great difficulty had
        obtained the ability to move freely within the parameters of the
        wheelchair's mobility. His left little finger, covered in a thick layer
        of plaster, had also regained its sense of pain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Father, regarding my application&mdash; what exactly is the judgment?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In contrast to the solicitous smile on his face, Kayneth's voice
        contained at least half an undertone of threat. Those drug addicts were
        probably like this when the effects had worn off and they were demanding
        drugs from others before they went into withdrawal. Risei gazed steadily
        at the face of this former magecraft prodigy; his face showed paranoia
        and confusion that could not be concealed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That things would reach this point was definitely not what Risei had
        hoped for. However, a contract was ultimately a contract. Setting aside
        the consideration of the secret alliance with Tōsaka for the moment, it
        was necessary to practise what he preached for the honor of the Church.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... Indeed, in the crusade against Caster, Servant-Lancer played an
        important role; this has also been verified in the report of the
        supervisor."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That is to say, there is no doubt that I am eligible to receive a
        Command Seal?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Though it is like that..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Father Risei furrowed his brow, and glanced at Kayneth as if feeling
        something is inconceivable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of course, in accordance to the agreement it is necessary to give the
        Master of Lancer a fitting reward... Mr. Kayneth, do you think I can
        regard you as a Master??"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A look of hatred momentarily appeared in Kayneth's eyes, but he
        immediately recovered his demeanor that's cautious enough to be called
        gentlemanly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Regarding the contract with Lancer, I established it in the form that
        it would be jointly borne by me and my fiancée Sola. I certainly do not
        have the intention of proclaiming myself a Master. The two of us, Sola
        and I, are one Master."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But now, are not both the supply of prana and the management of the
        Command Seals the undertaking of Miss Sola alone?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth's grimacing expression was truly difficult to explain away as a
        gracious smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Because of consideration for strategy, the Command Seals have now been
        temporarily passed to Sola for safekeeping. But the control over the
        contract with Lancer is still mine. If you are suspicious, you may ask
        Lancer directly for confirmation. And most importantly, the signature on
        the application submitted to the Church is mine alone."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Father Risei sighed. Even if he were to dig deep into the matter, make
        objections on the grounds of small and unimportant points, it would be
        meaningless. The true source of Risei’s headache was this unexpected
        situation of having to pass out Command Seals to a Master other than
        Tokiomi Tosaka. At this time, even if he were unwilling to add the
        Command Seal to Kayneth, at the end it would not be possible not to pass
        the Command Seals that he's reluctant to part with to his fiancée. Even
        if Father Risei were to interfere in the internal conflict of the
        Archibald faction, it would be of no benefit to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "&mdash;&mdash;All right. I acknowledge your status as a Master. Come,
        sir Kayneth, please hold out your hand."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With practised skill Risei traced the faded marks on Kayneth's
        outstretched right hand, transferring one of the Command Seals
        accumulated on his right wrist to Kayneth's hand. There was not even any
        pain; the entire process was concluded in only a few minutes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then please continue to fight glorious battles as a
        Master&mdash;&mdash;"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That is most certain."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth nodded, all smiles, then took out a handgun that had been hidden
        in the seat of his wheelchair, and aimed at the priest who had already
        turned away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The dry sound of a gun firing broke the silence of the Hall of God.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth did not even spare another glance for the old priest who had
        slumped down, and stared transfixed at the picture of the Command Seal
        carved on the back of his right hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Things had progressed to this point but he had only one... compared to
        the opponents who had not used their Command Seals, he was already in a
        disadvantaged position. And the Masters of Saber and Rider had already
        obtained new Command Seals; these circumstances definitely could not be
        ignored.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The assassination of the supervisor would undoubtedly cause a stir, but
        in this Heaven's Feel, there were magi other than himself who liked to
        use small props such as handguns. The primary suspect would thus be the
        filthy rat employed by the Einsberns.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth could not suppress the satisfied laugh that flooded forth from
        deep in his throat. He was immersed in the ecstasy of regaining his
        status as a Master. For the assassination of the supervisor, an action
        that made the dignity and pride of Lord El-Melloi plummet down to the
        floor, he had no intention of self-reproach.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre6">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immediately upon stepping into the chapel, Kirei felt the presence of
        death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A faint stench of blood, and the remaining, even fainter odor of smoke.
        Certainly there had been someone who had committed an unforgivably
        wicked deed in this house of God.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though he did not sense any danger, Kirei still walked in very
        carefully, passing through the pews - upon arriving at the altar, he
        discovered the silhouette lying at the side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Father&mdash;"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The cry that rose from his lips was weak. At the same time as
        discovering the silhouette of Father Risei, the trained and keenly
        observant eyes of an Executor noticed the bullet hole in his back and
        the pool of blood on the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei, in a state of complete mental torpor, carefully examined the
        corpse of his father.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He pulled up the right sleeve, checking the number of the Command Seals
        his father had managed. As expected, there was one less. Risei had given
        one of the Command Seals under his management to someone, and had
        presumably been murdered by this person soon after. One of the Masters
        that had won merit in the process of the crusade against Caster had been
        dissatisfied with sharing the credit with the others he had fought
        alongside, and had therefore committed such a crime. There was
        essentially no need for analysis to be able to determine the entire
        sequence of events.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But even a magus could not seize all the Command Seals from the hands of
        the dead elderly priest. The Command Seals managed by the supervisor
        were protected by holy prayers. Without his permission, it is not
        possible to seize them through the use of thaumaturgy. Father Risei, the
        only one who knew the secret holy words, was already dead; the Command
        Seals of previous Grail Wars preserved to this day could no longer be
        used.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &mdash;&mdash;That wasn't right; would Father Risei have permitted such
        a thing to happen?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei lifted his father's right hand, discovering that there were
        unnatural bloodstains on the fingertips. They seemed to be marks made
        with abrasions. The dying Father Risei had immersed his finger in the
        pool of blood, and must have left clues somewhere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since he had understood this, it was relatively easy to find the words
        in blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the floor, the final will in red-black writing was "jn424"-- one not
        of Christian faith might think this to be a secret message of unknown
        meaning. But to Kirei, who had inherited Risei's pious faith, the
        significance of this cipher was very obvious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        John 4:24. Without missing a word, Kirei recited those holy words stored
        in his memory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in
        truth&mdash;&mdash;"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if in response, on the already cold right wrist of Father Risei, all
        the Command Seals simultaneously gave off a faint light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Accompanying a burst of dull pain, the Command Seals were transferred
        one by one onto Kirei's arm. Speechless, Kirei stared at the light of
        the Command Seals.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Undoubtedly, that was the faith a father had entrusted to his son.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Father Risei had believed that the first person to discover his corpse
        would definitely be his son. Only so did he write down in blood a code
        that only one of the clergy could understand. He had entrusted all the
        important duties of the supervisor&mdash;managing the Command Seals,
        guarding the Grail, guiding the Heaven's Feel in the right
        direction&mdash;to his son. He had truly believed that his son was one
        who could bear these responsibilities; even in death, he had no doubt of
        this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not know that Kirei had concealed his newly-obtained Command
        Seals, and had already gained the right to be a Master&mdash;&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not know that his son had, on an impulse, sown the seeds of
        disaster for his benefactor Tokiomi&mdash;&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly feeling the tears falling from his cheeks, Kirei pressed his
        hands to his face, stunned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To shed tears in front of his father's corpse and last wishes... ... as
        a person, this was natural.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even thus, at that time Kirei had been mired in terror and confusion, as
        if almost falling into the abyss of hell.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He must face all this directly&mdash;&mdash;in his heart there was an
        authoritative voice telling him thus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The feelings flooding up from your heart now, Kotomine Kirei&mdash;you
        must understand all of this, must accept all of this. That is
        because&mdash;&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tears.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When was the last time he had shed tears? Now he still clearly
        remembered that it had been three years ago. Using a hand to scoop up
        the falling tears, that woman had once said this: "You love me."
        &mdash;&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The intrinsic ability in his heart to conceal oneself was staunchly
        blocking recollection.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He cannot turn back. He cannot reflect. The tears shed that day, the
        feelings held that time, needed to be tossed into the abyss of
        forgetting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The answer he had once understood.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The truth he had painstakingly come to realize.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it was because he had not faced this with an open heart and had thus
        adopted the method of avoidance that allowed him to maintain his current
        condition --
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could not comprehend the tears that flowed once more at all. The same
        feelings as at that time were crying out to the sentiments that had been
        sealed away and sought for understanding.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But heedless of these rational warnings, memories seeped continuously
        forth from the gaps between the seals.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time was very far from the ending he had expected -- he had thought
        thus then.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the bedside of the frail, dying woman, had Kirei not come to realize
        the thing which his consciousness desired?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Wanting to ■ ■ ■ ■ this woman&mdash;&mdash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wanting to see this woman even more ■ ■ ■ ■ &mdash;&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In deeply loving Kotomine Kirei and trusting him&mdash;&mdash;in this
        aspect, his father, and this woman, did have something in common.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They are also the same in absolutely misunderstanding the nature of the
        person that is Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Precisely because of this, three years ago Kirei had constantly prayed
        like this in his heart...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the moments before his father’s death, let him sample once again the
        joy of the greatest ■ ■ ■ ■ of the mortal world&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Just like those beasts who chase the scent of blood&mdash;&mdash; The
        soul pursues pleasure&mdash;&mdash;"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if the ruby-like eyes that had been latent in the bottom of his
        heart, accompanied by that sinister laugh, were quietly whispering.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only pleasure is the form of the soul-did he not speak thus? The nature
        of Kotomine Kirei is also like this&mdash;&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...O Lord... hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
        on earth as it is in heaven."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The familiar prayer he had to recite every day instantly spewed forth
        from his mouth; this might have been an instinct of self-preservation.
        In this way he returned to his role as a clergyman, tightly binding a
        soul that was close to falling to pieces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us…
        and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil… Amen.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He sealed the cursed truth of the tears falling uninterrupted from his
        face to forgetfulness's other shore. Kirei prayed for his father's
