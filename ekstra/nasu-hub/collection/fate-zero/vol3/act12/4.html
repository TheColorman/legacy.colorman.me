      <h2 id="calibre_link-27" class="calibre2">-58:16:21</h2>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Regarding the midnight meeting at the Fuyuki Church, Tōsaka Tokiomi had
        naturally defined the number of people allowed to attend in the
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Apart from the respective Master and Servant, both sides can also bring
        along a supporter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Irisviel, who found it difficult to act alone, she never expected
        such a condition to exist. It would be impossible for her to rely on
        Saber’s strength if she happens to accidentally be caught in a
        battlefield later on. If Maiya happens to be beside her at that time,
        she would be much more at ease.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, as the reciprocal condition, one other person also attended
        apart from Tōsaka Tokiomi and Archer &ndash; at the end, when Tokiomi
        introduced that follower to Irisviel and the others as if it was nothing
        important, they couldn’t help but change their expressions a little.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Let me introduce him, Kotomine Kirei &ndash; my student. Although he
        was also someone who competed with all of you, it was in past. He had
        lost his Servant, and had given up the rights of a Master for a long
        time.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Is that all? Irisviel cast a dubious look at the other man, but Tokiomi
        was full of calmness and appeared not planning to say much else. Maybe
        he was underestimating the opponent. If not &ndash; then he may still be
        unaware of the feud between Irisviel and Kotomine Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber, leisurely reclining against the wall behind Tokiomi and the
        others, glared unblinkingly at the red-eyed Servant. Tonight, Archer had
        also removed his battle arrays and put on a set of ordinary clothes
        suitable to this era. Although the outfit, decorated with leather and
        lacquer, looked like it was full of a distasteful glamor, it did not
        create any incongruities when paired with the overwhelming presence of
        the golden Heroic Spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those blood-red eyes looked as if they stripped away Saber’s clothes
        just with their sight, licked and caressed her soft skin. What seeped
        out of his eyes was blatant lust. Although this inevitably stirred up
        Saber’s impulse of immediately drawing her sword and go into battle, she
        could only endure it when she thought of Irisviel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I am immensely thankful of your arrivals upon receiving my invitation.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was unclear whether he noticed the pressing presence of the three
        women; Tokiomi solicitously offered his opening speech.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The Heaven’s Feel this time is also finally about to enter the most
        important stage. Right now, all that’s left are the Masters of the
        ‘Three Families of the Beginning’, and one sudden intruder &ndash; then,
        do you of the Einsbern family have any thoughts on this battle
        situation?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“No.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After answering thus with a cold and clear voice, Irisviel continued to
        speak audaciously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “We have the strongest Saber, so there’s no need to stealthily grasp
        every opportunity. Just walking towards victory like this would be
        enough.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Is that so &ndash;”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a provoking undertone, Tokiomi couldn’t stop himself but laugh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Then, please allow me to speak of my own thoughts. Putting aside our
        respective strengths for now, let us talk about Berserker and Rider
        first.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, our final goal is to let the ‘Three Families of the
        Beginning’ remain and therefore ensure the right of possessing the Grail
        in the final battle. However, very unfortunately, due to a strategic
        mistake of the Matō family, a Servant that needs to spend large amounts
        of prana was summoned by a weak Master. I fear that they would face
        their demise sooner or later. It seems the one that would obtain victory
        among them will be Rider. I guess that you would also know something
        about the might of that Heroic Spirit Alexander.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi paused, waiting for Irisviel to react. However, seeing that she
        remained silent, Tokiomi continued speaking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “A newcomer who suddenly popped out of nowhere dares to stretch his
        hands towards the Holy Grail, in which two thousand years of longing
        were entrusted; does Einsbern not feel very uncomfortable about this?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Speaking of newcomers, aren’t Tōsakas and Matōs included in that too?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Normally, Irisviel will never speak so unscrupulously, but tonight’s
        strategy was to completely suppress Tokiomi. When she discarded her
        daily gentleness and demureness and stood upright to confront, she
        seemed as inviolable as a beautiful and adamant queen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But Tokiomi wasn’t going to succumb just with that. He still carried a
        solicitous smile, and his expression didn’t waver a bit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Since what Einsbern wishes for is only the fact of achieving the Third
        Magic, then would it fit your original intentions if you were to entrust
        the Holy Grail to me, Tōsaka Tokiomi, with my goal of reaching
        ‘Akasha’?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Irisviel cast a contemptuous sneer towards Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Could it be that the Tōsaka family would even beg just to rob the Holy
        Grail from our hands?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Huh… although the explanation would make one doubt the questioner’s
        moral character, it doesn’t matter. The question now is that this guy
        who knows nothing about the Grail has the possibility of obtaining the
        final victory. I would definitely not allow the Holy Grail to fall into
        a layman’s hands &ndash; our opinions should be the same on this point.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To put it simply &ndash; the one that Tokiomi considers as most
        threatening is only Rider. Irisviel agrees with that point.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since she already understood the opponent’s intent, then it would be
        about time for her to state her position.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “We Einsbern have never had the habit of uniting with others. A
        so-called alliance will only make others laugh &ndash; however, if you
        want to fight enemies one by one, we would also express our sincerity.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Go on.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Regard Tōsaka as our enemy only after all other Masters are defeated
        &ndash; we’re willing to obey such an agreement.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel’s roundabout way of speaking made Tokiomi nod his head coldly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “That’s to say, a ceasefire agreement with conditions attached. It’s
        appropriate for both parties.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“We have two demands.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if trying to suppress the other and take the initiative, Irisviel
        followed up,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Firstly, give us the information you have on Rider’s Master.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi sniggered in his heart when he heard this. Since Einsbern made
        such a demand, then it meant she really wanted to go defeat Rider
        herself. This development was completely within his expectations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; Kirei, tell them.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing Tokiomi’s command Kirei, who had stayed aside and waited
        silently, began to explain with a flat tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Rider’s Master is an apprentice magus named Waver Velvet, who was
        studying under Kayneth. He now flats in the home of an old couple
        surnamed MacKenzie in Miyama city, Nakagoe 2-chome. They are an ordinary
        family that has nothing to do with the Heaven’s Feel, but they think
        Waver is their own grandson under Waver’s hypnosis magecraft.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei finished fluently. Hearing this, Irisviel and Maiya couldn’t help
        but shiver. Although they’ve roughly guessed it, they didn’t think that
        Kirei, who had once controlled Assassin, could undertake a war of
        intelligence so thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Alright, what’s the other condition?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi urged delightedly. Irisviel stared straight at him with a solemn
        and heavy expression, and spoke with an uncompromising tone that didn’t
        allow the opponent to decline.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The second condition &ndash; is to eliminate Kotomine Kirei from the
        Heaven’s Feel.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi, who originally had a leisurely expression, couldn’t help but
        gape when he heard this. However, Kirei remained nonplussed, and didn’t
        even move his eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I didn’t mean to kill him. I’m only saying that he needs to leave
        Fuyuki &ndash; no, leave Japan &ndash; before the war finishes. We hope
        that he’d depart tomorrow morning.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Can you explain the reason?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi calmed the wavering of his heart and requested with a rather low
        voice. Irisviel, who could tell people’s emotions very clearly, believed
        more firmly that this pair of teacher and student has estrangements
        between them &ndash; it was obvious that Tokiomi did not know what Kirei
        did exactly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “That Executor has quite a feud with us Einsbern. If Tōsaka is to
        include him in your camp, then we would be completely unable to trust
        you. If so, then we would regard you as the target to be eliminated
        first, and unite with Rider and the others to initiate attacking you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There wasn’t a single hint of joking in Irisviel’s tone. Finally,
        Tokiomi detected that there were many things he didn’t know, and cast a
        doubtful look towards Kirei, who was beside him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What’s going on, Kirei?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei remained silent, expressionless as if wearing a mask. However,
        since he didn’t make any rebuttal to Irisviel’s words, his silence was
        enough to explain the problem.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a sigh, Tokiomi once again hid his emotions in the bottom of his
        heart, and gazed at the Einsbern camp with a nonchalant expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “As the substitute of the late Father Risei, Kirei had inherited the job
        of the Supervisor. If you believe that he must leave, then we have a
        condition too.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Silently, Irisviel inclined her head and motioned for him to continue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; I observed last night’s battle. That Saber of yours has a Noble
        Phantasm with an overly-powerful destructive power; we hope that you can
        restrain her use of it.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now Saber furrowed her brows. She understood that Tōsaka wanted to
        forcibly push the duel with Rider onto her. She could only regard this
        extra condition as being too unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Why are you interfering with our battle tactics?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “We are the managers of Fuyuki. If the Heaven’s Feel is going to leave
        the concealment of the Holy Church and proceed openly, then I hope
        unnecessary disturbances can be avoided.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Maiya, who had been quiet until now, suddenly
        interrupted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Saber’s Noble Phantasm caused damage to the surrounding structures last
        night?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Luckily, it was minimal damage. Coincidentally, there was a
        large ship on the path of her attack. However, one mistake would have
        indeed flattened all the houses on the opposite river bank.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“It was us who placed the ship there.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing Maiya’s words, Saber’s eyebrows twitched. Indeed, it was
        precisely because that ship was there that she was able to use Excalibur
        without worries. However, she only knew upon hearing Maiya that it was
        actually prepared by Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “On a side note, we’ve already confirmed that the owner of that ship has
        bought insurance. The Einsbern camp has already thoroughly considered
        the destructive power of Saber’s Noble Phantasm without needing you to
        remind us.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I’m asking you to put your so-called consideration into a treaty.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Rather toughly, Tokiomi interrupted Maiya’s words.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It is unconditionally forbidden to use Noble Phantasms on ground level
        in Fuyuki city. The same applies even if you’re on air if it would
        indirectly cause harm to residents &ndash; can you agree to this
        condition, Einsbern Master?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… If I agree, then would Kotomine Kirei really leave Japan?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah, I assure you of it, and can be held accountable.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi nodded without hesitation. Kirei, beside him, couldn’t let out
        his anger and could only grit his teeth tightly by himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel consulted Saber for her opinion. Saber nodded to show that she
        agreed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber also did not want her Noble Phantasm to create unnecessary
        sacrifices. This wouldn’t count as exceeding restriction if Tōsaka
        Tokiomi’s concern was the same as hers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Very good. Since you confirmed that you can fulfil the
        condition, then we also agree to a ceasefire.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre6">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the meeting concluded, Kotomine Kirei remained in the church,
        which both Masters have left, all by himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just like Tokiomi said then, Kirei, right now, as a member of the Holy
        Church, was proceeding with managing the aftermath all around Fuyuki
        City. Due to the death of his father, Risei, who was the Supervisor, the
        on-site command chain was completely fuddled and there was absolutely no
        time to wait for the Assembly of the Eighth Sacrament to send in the
        official successor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the work at each scene was now progressing methodically after
        giving only appropriate directions to the management at each place. This
        showed that the orders Risei made when he was alive was very much
        correct. Kirei’s job was to continue along the trail that Risei had
        already lain down and sends the duties down one by one; in truth, it
        wasn’t anything particularly difficult.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But right now he must make a decision concerning his work.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Actually, for Kirei, he had already understood that his situation was
        dangerous when he sensed Tokiomi had the intention of making an alliance
        with the Einsberns. The decision that he made at the meeting just now
        wasn’t surprising, either. The Einsbern women &ndash; and Emiya
        Kiritsugu, the true manipulator behind them &ndash; had gradually
        realized Kirei’s threat towards them, whereas he was only an ‘ordinary
        assistant’ for Tōsaka Tokiomi. Therefore, the alliance with Einsbern was
        more important to him than Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Moreover, Tokiomi didn’t know about the Command Seals that once again
        appeared on Kirei’s arm and the existence of the Command Seals that were
        taken back for safekeeping and secretly inherited from Risei. Nor had
        Kirei told him that Saber’s real Master, Emiya Kiritsugu, had yet to
        make an appearance, or that Matō Kariya was saved. The fact that he was
        hiding such important information at this time meant that Kirei had
        already discarded his duties as Tokiomi’s subordinate. Tokiomi would
        discover this sooner or later; right now Kirei didn’t have the right to
        complain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After contacting the employees distributed everywhere by phone, Kirei
        returned to his room alone. He sat down on the edge of the bed, and felt
        the quietness and stillness of the empty church.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei questioned his own heart while he stared at the darkness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had already asked himself like this thousands and tens of thousands
        of times in his life up until now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But this question was really pressing down on him tonight. Only, this
        time he had to come to an answer before dawn break.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Just what, is my wish?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Among the vast amount of information that the employees passed on while
        they were cleaning up the aftermath, there were two pieces of
        information that Kirei could not ignore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One &ndash; an adult male body that died in a weird fashion appeared
        before the public at the riverside, where things have sunk into chaos
        after being stirred up by Caster’s sea demon. The corpse was taken over
        by the Holy Church and avoided being handed over to the police. It could
        no longer be identified due to severe facial damage, but due to the
        traces of the Command Seals on its right hand it can be roughly
        determined that he was Caster’s Master, Uryū Ryūnosuke. Cause of death
        &ndash; large diameter rifle bullets with diameters of 30 millimeters or
        more, two shots.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The other report was even more shocking.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just a few hours ago, the bodies of Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald and
        Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri were found within an abandoned factory on the
        outskirts of Shinto. The two bodies have similarly been discovered by
        Church employees while patrolling and were dealt with. A discarded and
        signed Self-Geis Scroll was found at the scene. This was the naked
        evidence of the perpetrator having used despicable means to kill
        Lancer’s Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Emiya Kiritsugu &ndash; this cruel and emotionless hunting machine was
        eliminating his opponents one by one.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What he was afraid was that Kiritsugu was still continuing the war
        somewhere out there. Different from Kirei, who could only sit on the
        spot, perplexed, he was stepping towards the Holy Grail pressingly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This battlefield named Fuyuki made a man who had continuously devoted to
        hollow battles re-emerge after a nine-year long silence. However, before
        Kirei knew just what his intentions and reasons were, he has to leave
        here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What would that man pray for when he obtains the omnipotent
        wish-granting vessel?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Would that answer really fill up the emptiness in Kirei’s heart?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Who, are you?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He suddenly muttered to himself. He had once expected Emiya Kiritsugu
        with a premonition almost equal to prayers, expecting his answer. Now
        Kirei had a sense of danger. The image that crisscrossed his mind was
        that of the women who stood upright in front of Kiritsugu and protected
        him. Why would they risk their lives for Kiritsugu? Or was it that
        Kiritsugu had sunken so low, to the mundane degree of sharing his own
        goal with a third party?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei felt a presence stirring up in the deep quietness. The presence
        was approaching him from the corridor outside his door. Kirei had
        already become very familiar with this presence. Even if he was only
        walking silently, that Heroic Spirit did not hide the flamboyant majesty
        emanating out of him. Even if he were stepping into the realm of gods,
        he remained as obstinate and unrestrained as ever.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer didn’t knock and stepped into Kirei’s room straight away. He
        sneered with a sarcastic and pitiful tone when he saw Kirei was deep in
        thought.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What are you thinking of, even at this stage? There should be a limit
        on being slow.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… You let Tokiomi-sensei go back on his own, Archer?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I was with him until the house. Recently there were poisonous insects
        more treacherous than Assassin lurking in the night.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei nodded. That Emiya Kiritsugu won’t ignore the meeting just then;
        he would definitely seek an opportunity to act during Tokiomi’s journey
        to or back from the meeting. Kirei had briefed someone thoroughly about
        that point &ndash; not to Tokiomi, but to Archer.

        “However, you really are an honest guy. Knowing that you’re situation is
        getting worse but still worried about the safety of your lord.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This is a logical decision. I had long finished my duty of being
        Tokiomi-sensei’s tool, and there were no reasons left to keep staying at
        Fuyuki.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; You don’t really think that, right?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer’s gaze seemed to have seen through everything. Silently, Kirei
        gazed back at him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Kirei didn’t plan to rebuke, because what Archer said wasn’t
        wrong. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be sitting here idiotically, and would
        already be making preparations for leaving Fuyuki.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Even now, the Holy Grail is still calling to you, and you yourself are
        also longing to keep on fighting.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer said thus. Kirei remained silent, and gave up on rebuttal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter what he says, there’s nothing to hide in front of Archer. That
        Heroic Spirit had even seen through the fact that he was only deceiving
        everyone including himself. Then, maybe the answer that Kirei had always
        sought was also already within his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was as if those twin red eyes were gazing from above at little white
        mice, wandering lost and perplexed. There was no inducement, nor was
        there salvation; maybe appreciating other’s worries was something that
        made the King of Heroics delighted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… Ever since I can remember, I’ve been looking into one question.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if confessing to the darkness within his heart, Kirei stood in front
        of Archer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Wasting time, enduring the pain… but everything ended in fruitlessness.
        However, right now I feel that I have never been closer to the ‘answer’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What I seek must be at Fuyuki, at the end of the war.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After he said those words, Kirei once again understood just what drove
        him to walk on till today.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a long time ago, when Kotomine Kirei was yet to be Tōsaka
        Tokiomi’s hound. The Kirei back then continuously stirred up dissent
        just for himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Since you’ve reflected so much, then why are you perplexed?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Archer asked coldly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Kirei lowered his head and looked at his open hands, then
        covered his face as if going to sigh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I have an ominous premonition &ndash; I would walk towards annihilation
        when I have obtained all the answers.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the expectation that was endowed on Emiya Kiritsugu was not fulfilled
        &ndash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And if he couldn’t find something else in Matō Kariya’s end either
        &ndash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, Kirei could no longer turn back; he could only face it. He could
        only try to face the thing that he discovered in the deaths of his
        father and wife.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It would be better for him to just turn around and leave. Be Tōsaka
        Tokiomi’s deferent disciple until the end and obediently leave. That
        way, it would at least look better on the face of it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And forget everything from now on. Don’t ask anything, don’t demand
        anything, and pass through a busy but mundane life like a plant would.
        No matter what he had lost, this would at least let him rest in peace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Don’t think of those boring things, idiot.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer’s reminder interrupted the thought that he had almost been
        prepared to fulfil.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You won’t be troubled until now if you could change your way of life so
        easily. You, who’s used to questioning while you’re alive, would die
        with questions at the end too. You won’t receive the answer, and can’t
        rest in peace.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Maybe I should congratulate you. You’re finally going to arrive at the
        destination after such a lengthy journey.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… You would congratulate someone else, Archer?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer inclined his head. There was still no sentimentality on his face,
        but it was sparkling with an innocent and joyous light like a child
        observing an ant hill.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I should have told you that observing humanity’s cause and retribution
        is the most interesting entertainment. I, the king, full-heartedly looks
        forward to the moment when you come face to face with your destiny.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Heroes said this gallantly. Hearing this, Kirei gave a
        bitter laugh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Is it really so fun to live so stubbornly for the greed of
        ‘enjoyment’?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If you’re jealous, you can try to live a little like this too. You
        won’t fear annihilation once you comprehend just what is enjoyment.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The phone in the priest’s office in the corridor outside rang. As if he
        had already predicted it, Kirei did not appear to be surprised in
        anyway. He walked out of the room, picked up the receiver, and quickly
        disconnected the phone after just a few words and returned to the room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; What’s wrong?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It’s a call from the employees of the Holy Church who originally worked
        under my father. They now have to report everything to me.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that Kirei’s expression was unusually relaxed, Archer furrowed
        his brows and asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Are there some good news?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“You could say that. This news is quite decisive.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After this, Kirei hesitated for a while, considering whether he should
        say it. However, at the end, he still chose confession.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I sent people to follow those from the Einsbern camp after the end of
        the recent meeting. I told them it was my father’s order given before he
        passed away, so they went and did so. Thanks to that, I found out the
        place where those three are currently hiding.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After Archer heard Kirei through, he couldn’t help but be stunned for a
        little while.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then the King of Heroes laughed heartily. He clapped continuously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Honestly Kirei &ndash; you really are &ndash;&nbsp;! Haven’t
        you already made up your mind ages ago!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was still using his own position to detect the movements of the enemy
        camps, so it would be impossible for him not to join the fight. While
        Kirei was being anxious, the battle strategy had made concrete
        advancements.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But he had not made the mental preparations just then &ndash; just a few
        minutes ago.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I was lost once, and had also wanted to give up. But at the end &ndash;
        King of Heroes, it’s like what you said &ndash; someone like me can only
        live on with questions.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Kirei spoke, he rolled up his sleeves and confirmed the Command Seals
        on his arms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were two Command Seals on his left lower arm. Command Seals that
        would allow Kirei to make a contract once again with a Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Meanwhile, the Command Seals that were taken back for safe keeping and
        inherited from his father covered his entire right arm. The innumerable
        Command Seals, yet to confirm a target for a contract, can be used and
        forged into highly practical prana that has no alignments, and can be
        used to restrain Servants as well. That means they can be used as mock
        Magic Crests. Apart from the fact that they are expandable, the
        magecraft that Kirei now possessed was enough to rival famous magecraft
        houses that have collected their Crests through the generations. Kirei’s
        preparation was more than enough for him to continue participating in
        the Heaven’s Feel that was still going on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were no greater good and no illusionary glories on the road before
        him. A battle that only belonged to Kotomine Kirei was about to start.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In order to fill his own nihility, in order to confirm the capacity of
        his own emptiness &ndash; he would question Emiya Kiritsugu, question
        Matō Kariya, and question the wish-granting vessel, the Holy Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hahahaha &ndash; however, Kirei, although it’s a bit abrupt, I have a
        few questions.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer laughed madly and arrogantly. Those blood-red eyes were
        permeating with the implications of a prank &ndash; and at the same time
        carried an evil shade.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If you’ve really decided to participate in the War of the Holy Grail,
        then you would become Tōsaka Tokiomi’s enemy. That’s to say, right now
        you’re staying defenselessly in the same room with the enemy’s Servant.
        Isn’t this very awful?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Not necessarily; I do still have ways to keep myself alive.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Oh?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Archer, interested, narrowed his eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kirei spoke calmly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Since now I am already opposing Tokiomi-sensei, then I don’t need to
        hide his lies anymore &ndash; Gilgamesh, let me tell you the truth of
        the Heaven’s Feel that you don’t know about.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… What did you say?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Archer furrowed his brows with perplexity. Kirei proceeded
        to speak thoroughly of the truth of the Heaven’s Feel that he got to
        know from Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The miracle that occurs in the ‘inside’ of this world cannot be used
        universally on the ‘outside’ of the world. The fight over the
        wish-granting vessel is only a camouflage; the ‘Three Noble Families of
        the Beginning’ has other plans.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ceremony that had originally been held in Fuyuki was a kind of
        attempt to use the souls of seven Heroic Spirits as sacrifices to open
        the road that leads to the ‘Root’. The promise of ‘Fulfil a miracle’ was
        also only bait used to attract Heroic Spirits. However, as the result of
        the unilateral spread of this ‘bait’, the current Heaven’s Feel had lost
        its original meanings and is only left with an empty shell.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is a secret known only to the Matōs, Tōsakas, and Einsberns and
        people related them. The foreign Masters and all of the Servants are
        oblivious to this truth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This time around, the only magus who wants to fulfil the once
        long-cherished wish of the ‘Three Noble Families of the Beginning’ is
        Tōsaka Tokiomi. He wants to kill all seven Servants to activate ‘the
        Greater Grail’. That’s right, kill all seven. Do you understand? &ndash;
        that’s why Tokiomi-sensei was so stingy with the expenditure of Command
        Seals. He can only use two Command Seals in the battle with other
        Masters. He needs to use the final one that’s left to order his own
        Servant to commit suicide once everything is finished.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer heard him through without interruption, then questions with a
        lowered voice and with an extremely apathetic expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… You’re telling me that the loyalty Tōsaka Tokiomi had shown to me
        were all to deceive me?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei knows his teacher’s character. Therefore, he slowly shook his
        head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “He indeed does have the uttermost respect for ‘Gilgamesh, King of
        Heroes’. However, it’s completely different for the Servant Archer.
        That’s to say, you’re only a representation, a meaning not too far off
        from a statue or a portrait. Everyone who walks past it would give it a
        respectable look of admiration if it’s put at the most conspicuous place
        in a gallery &ndash; but if this representation was removed when the
        collection is being rotated off, then it would be despised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That’s to say, Tokiomi-sensei is a complete ‘magus’ at the end. For him,
        a Servant is just a tool. He had once calmly told me that even if he
        admires Heroic Spirits, he won’t harbor any illusions towards idols.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing Kirei’s account, Archer nodded dramatically as if suddenly
        realizing something, then once again showed that evil smile he had
        beforehand. There was cruelty within tolerance, decisiveness within
        boldness; it was the smile of a king who was an absolute existence, who
        could decide everything with just one word.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Tokiomi &ndash; today I’ve finally discovered your worth. Even that
        boring man can make me so delighted.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If viewed from the meanings hidden beneath those words, this was
        definitely a tragic declaration enough to freeze someone’s blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “King of Heroes, what do you plan to do? Will you still show loyalty to
        Tokiomi-sensei even so, and punish my betrayal?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Yes, what should I do? Although he has been disloyal to me, Tokiomi is
        after all my prana provider. Moreover, where would I get a perfect
        Master &ndash;”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer stopped speaking, and suddenly gazed at Kirei with a cold
        expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah &ndash; speaking of, it seems like there is a Master here who had
        obtained Command Seals, but had lost his Servant.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“You speak the truth.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Using a smile to reply to Archer’s naked lure, Kirei lowered his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But does that man have the worth to be graced with the favor of the
        King of Heroes?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “No problems. Although it’s not flawless, there is enough potential.
        Maybe he’d even be able to let me thoroughly enjoy myself.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">&ndash; Like so.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that moment, the final Master and Servant chosen by fate exchanged
        smiles to each other for the first time.
      </p>

        ‘It’ was lost in an abyss of shallow slumber within the darkness sealed
        in the bottomless earth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What ‘It’ dreamt of in the shallow slumber &ndash; was the endless
        ‘prayers’, unreasonable and unattainable, that have been entrusted a
        long time ago.

        A beautiful world. A beautiful life. A flawless soul.

      <p class="calibre3">
        There is no evil apart from me. This is no imperfection apart from me.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I am the only one who should be hated. I am the only one who should be
        abhorred.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like thus, ‘It’ saved the world, and let them obtain peace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Therefore &ndash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘It’ was not a saint who saved men and aided the world. Without praises,
        without reverence, without tributes, but only with spurns, only curses,
        only disdain… before ‘It’ knew it, even its name as a human had been
        rubbed away, only left with a title of its ‘way of existence’, and
        finally became a concept that was passed down through the ages.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Until now, all that had already became a dream of memories that had had
        its full share of time’s baptism.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Just how much time had passed since then?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, ‘It’ was thinking dazedly on top of the bed it had slept on
        peacefully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It felt like some complicated changes had occurred. That’s right; it was
        about sixty years ago. Something had happened almost in the blink of an
        eye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because it happened so suddenly, ‘It’ didn’t understand everything
        completely &ndash; when ‘It’ came to, ‘It’ was already at a place like a
        mother’s warm placenta.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An infinite darkness that sighed in the deepest place beneath the earth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back then, it had been a place that had concealed an ‘egg’ that had
        endless possibilities. One day, like a seed, ‘It’ entered and planted
        its roots into this place. From that day on, that place because the
        abdominal cavity that nurtured a darkness that didn’t belong to
        anything, veritably became a uterus with the purpose of fostering ‘It’
        into maturity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since then, ‘It’ had surely absorbed the prana that flew in from the
        leylines in the earth like a baby that obtained nourishment from the
        mother’s placenta while ‘It’ slept in its shallow slumber. While ‘It’
        veritably grew, ‘It’ waited without being discovered by anyone for the
        arrival of an opportunity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waiting to one day leave this scorching profound darkness, the moment of
        delivery.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, ‘It’ &ndash; perked up its ears and listened for the sound
        coming from near ‘It’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Just then, someone really did speak.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…all the evils of this world… it won’t matter… gladly accept it…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Aaah, someone was calling ‘It’.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Blessing and itself were both called by someone.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Answer him. It must be able to right now.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The prana whirlpool that had swelled long ago to an incomparable size in
        the darkness gave ‘It’ a concrete form.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The endless ‘prayers’ that had been entrusted in the distant past should
        also be able to be fulfilled right now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An ‘existence’ like something that was prayed upon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">‘Going to do’ all the things that were wished for.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">All the pieces of the puzzle had been assembled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The gears of fate grinded together, and were now turning bravely,
        accelerating with the day of completion as their goal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All that’s left &ndash; was waiting for the birthing canal to open.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As ‘It’ dreamed in its shallow slumber, ‘It’ emitted cries that will dye
        the world crimson red…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘It’ also repeated its contractions in the darkness beneath the earth,
        unknown to anyone else.
