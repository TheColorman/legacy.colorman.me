      <h2 id="calibre_link-27" class="calibre2">-102:54:10</h2>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Saber dramatically finished her sentence, everyone lapsed into
        silence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The one who was most confused was Saber herself.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An awkward silence filled the room.
        <i class="calibre5">This made no sense.</i> Even though she spoke with
        emphasis, no one in the room was easily cowed by talk.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was plain and clear, without any room for doubt. That was her
        kingship. There was nothing surprising about it. What was surprising was
        that no one voiced dissent or agreement &ndash; when it was obvious that
        those words should have been immediately said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hey King of Knights, I might have heard you wrong but...?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider finally broke the silence, his face was plainly confused.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Did you say "you want to change fate"? Which means you want to reverse
        history?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Correct. Even if the wish is something cannot be granted through a
        miracle, if the Holy Grail is truly omnipotent, surely...”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber answered haughtily. Now she understood why the atmosphere between
        the two kings was so special &ndash; immediately, the situation cooled
        down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Errr, Saber? I’d like to confirm this...... The destruction of that
        Britain was in your time, right? During your reign?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Yes! That is why I cannot forgive myself.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Saber answered, her tone becoming firmer.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “That's why I can't let things be that way. The destruction of my
        country was my fault, and thus I want to reverse it.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, someone laughed out loud. The laughter was a base,
        incomprehensible laugh. And the laugh was coming out of the mouth of
        that shining golden Archer. 　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the face of such grave insults, Saber’s face was full of anger. The
        thing most precious to her was ridiculed by Archer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…Archer. What’s so funny?　　</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ignoring Saber’s wrath, the golden Heroic Spirit replied brokenly as he
        guffawed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Calling yourself a king &ndash; praised by all &ndash; a person like
        you could have 'regrets?' Ha! Of course it was funny. Saber! You’re the
        world’s best clown!” 　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Beside Archer, who was laughing uncontrollably, Rider creased his brow
        as he stared at Saber with worry in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hold on. You, hold on, King of Knights, you want to deny the history in
        which you’ve created?”　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber never had any doubts to her own ideals, and of course, would not
        be stopped by Rider’s question.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Correct. Why you suspect me? Why are you laughing? The country to which
        I sacrificed my life as a king had perished. Is there something wrong
        with me grieving?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The thing answering her was again, a burst of laughter from Archer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Oi, oi, did you hear that, Rider! This young girl who calls herself the
        King of Knights &ndash; is saying something about sacrificing for her
        country!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In response to Archer was Rider’s deepening silence and increasing
        gloomy expression. To Saber, it was just as humiliating as being laughed
        at.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I don’t understand what is there to be laughing about. As kings, we
        should naturally sacrifice ourselves, and strive to create a better
        country!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“No, you’re wrong.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">In a firm, rock-like voice, Rider objected.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It’s not the king sacrificing for the nation. It’s the nation and the
        people sacrificing their lives for the king. You got it backwards.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What-?!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber could no longer suppress her own anger. She shouted loudly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “──Isn't that a tyrant's rule?──Rider, Archer, you bastards are nowhere
        near a king! Heretics!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“True. We are tyrants, therefore we are heroes.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider answered without so much as a change in his facial expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “We take full responsibility for our nations. Therefore, Saber. Listen
        to me. If a king is not content with his own kingdom, he is a weak
        ruler. A weak ruler is a worse king to have than a tyrant!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unlike Archer, who had ridiculed her for all this time, Rider had
        rejected her from the basis of her ideals. Saber’s brows narrows as she
        retorted sharply.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Alexander, you…Your own empire. It became four separate warring
        factions that quickly disappeared into the sands of history. At that
        ending, you don't have any regrets? If you can redo it, you'd want to
        save your motherland...aren't you thinking about that?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“No.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Raising himself to his full height, the King of Conquerors met Saber’s
        furious gaze with his own.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “No, I do not. If the actions of me and my generals lead to the eventual
        demise of my own nation, then I will accept it for what it is! Yes, I
        will grieve. Yes, I will shed tears. But I will not have a single
        regret!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…What?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Don’t you even dare suggesting something as stupid as an attempt to
        rewrite history! Such an idiotic action, is an insult to all of humanity
        who lived during my time!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In response to Rider’s haughty declaration, Saber shook her head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What you’re saying is only the glory of a simple fighter. The people
        won’t wish for such things. Salvation would be their prayer."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“You’re saying they want the king’s salvation?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Rider shrugged as he laughed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I don’t get it! What’s the point of such a useless thing?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“That is the true worth of a king!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, it was Saber’s turn to answer arrogantly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “A correct governance, a lawful society, all subjects would probably be
        wishing for them.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Are you a slave to this “correctness,” then?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You could say that. The only one fit to rule is someone who would
        willingly give themselves up for an ideal.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without any hint of hesitation, the young King of Knights nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Through the king, the people could understand law and order. The king
        should not express something that would disappear upon the king’s death,
        but rather something more precious.”　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Saber who had proclaimed that firmly, while displaying a feeling as
        if he pitied her somewhere, Rider let out a deep sigh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“That is not a path taken by a human being.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Correct. As king, we cannot hope for a normal life.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To become the perfect ruler, to become the embodiment of the ideals, she
        was willing to give up her body and throw away her emotions. The life of
        that young woman whose name was Arturia was changed completely the
        moment she pulled that sword out of the stone. From then on, she became
        a legend of victory, a synonym of praises and dreams.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was pain, there was disappointment, but within it was the radiance
        of victory. An unchangeable ideal which still supported her sword arm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “King of Conquerors! A king like you could never understand my own
        beliefs! You’re nothing but a bully who was blinded by his own desires!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber shouted sternly. Rider’s eyes immediately widened as he answered
        in response.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “A desireless king is no better than a flower vase!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider’s loud roar, plus his gigantic body, made him appear more
        fearsome.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Saber, you just said that you needed to 'sacrifice for your ideals.'
        Indeed. You’re some saint &ndash; so holy that no one could ever hope to
        come near you. But who would be willing to die for their empty beliefs?
        And who would be thinking about this so-called saint day and night? You
        could only comfort the people, but not lead the people. The only way to
        bring country and people upon the right path is to present those
        desires, and the glory that could be found only in legends.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Draining his cup, the King of Conquerors corrected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “As king, you must have stronger desires than anyone else. You must be
        more magnificent, more easily angered than everyone else! He should be
        both pure and chaotic, a man who was more real than any other man. Only
        through this, could your subjects be impressed by the king, and only
        this, would the message of 'if only I was king, that would be wondrous'
        would be imprinted upon the people’s heart”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Such a way of kingship… where on earth is the justice?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It doesn’t exist. Justice is unnecessary in the principles of a king.
        That's exactly why there is no remorse.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was too adamant in his opinions, and Saber was already uncontrollably
        angry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though the basis was for their people, the two’s ideals were too far
        apart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">One side prayed for peace.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The other dreamed about prosperity.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The king who suppressed the chaos of war and the king who stirred up the
        chaos of war, there was no way their ideals could have been the same.
        　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Rider smiled as he continued bluntly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “King of Knights. Your justice and ideals might have saved your people
        and country for a time, and thus, your name is praised until today, mm?
        Although, the people’s lives whom you saved, and their end, you did know
        what happened at the end, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What…did you say?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The bloodstained sunset hill.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That sight was once again reignited in Saber’s brain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You wanted solely to 'save' your subjects, yet you’ve never 'guided'
        them. They don’t know “the king’s wishes.” You ignored the lost
        subjects, yet you yourself pretended to be saintly, drunk in your own
        narrow views.　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, you’re not a good king. You’re only someone who wanted to become
        someone who took care of the people. You’re just a little girl who spun
        a cocoon around yourself in order to become that idealized view.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were many things she wanted to say in retort. Yet, every time she
        opened her mouth, she could only see the site she witnessed at Camlann.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bodies everywhere. The blood ran like a river. There lied her subjects,
        friends, and loved ones. 　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As she pulled out that sword in the stone she knew about the prophecy.
        She knew that she was destined to fail, and she already understood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">But…why…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As she witnessed the sight personally, she felt surprised. She could do
        nothing else but pray.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Once a magus prophesied it was nearly impossible to go against fate.
        Yet, she still wondered, if she could have a miracle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">A dangerous thought occupied Saber’s thoughts.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If she wasn’t England’s savior, but rather a tyrant who ravished
        England…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The chaotic world would only become more chaotic. First, that was not
        her way of kingship. And no matter what perspective, she would never
        make that choice as Arturia.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But, if she really did that…in comparison to Camlann, which one was more
        tragic?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, she felt a chill on her spine. The chill brought her back to
        reality.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">It was Archer’s look.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The golden servant had left them alone since Saber had started arguing
        with Rider. He himself sat by a corner and drank quietly. His deep-red
        pupils started studying her, but she didn’t know when.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He said nothing, and only judging from his eyesight, one could not read
        his intent. But there was something lascivious in his gaze. It was as if
        a snake crawling up her body, bringing her humiliation and unease.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…Archer, why are you looking at me?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah, I am merely studying your annoyed expression.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer’s smile was surprisingly gentle, but at the same time, fearsome.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It is like a virgin on which flowers are being scattered, lying on the
        bed. I like it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“You bastard….”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Saber, this was a mockery hard to be forgiven. Without any tinge of
        hesitation, she threw down her cup, and a sound could be heard from the
        sheath of the invisible sword.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But at the next moment, the thing that made the other two change their
        expressions was not her threatening attitude.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Moments later, Irisviel and Waver also felt something different in the
        surrounding air. Though it was unseen, through their skin they could
        feel extremely heavy murderous intent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Strange white creatures emerged in the center of the moonlit court. One
        after the other, their pale white visages were like blooming flowers as
        they appeared. The paleness was the color of cold, dry bone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Skull masks and black cloaks. The previously empty center court slowly
        became surrounded by this strange group.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Assassin…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not only Rider and Waver knew that they were still alive, but Saber and
        Irisviel also learned of the detail from their conversation with
        Kiritsugu on warehouse street.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Assassin was not limited to the one slain near the Tōsaka residence. The
        reality was, there were many Assassins &ndash; an unnaturally numerous
        number of Assassins that participated in this Heaven’s feel. They all
        wore masks and were clad in black robes, and their body sizes differed
        as well. Some were giant, some were slim, some where short like children
        while some were women.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…This is your doing? Archer.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Archer shrugged rather innocently.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Who knows, I have no need to understand the thoughts of mongrels"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since this many Assassins are gathered here, their command cannot have
        originated from just Kirei. Perhaps it is the plans of his mentor,
        Tōsaka?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because Tōsaka has declared fealty to the King of Heroes, Archer
        grudgingly recognized the Master. However, what Tōsaka did now was
        extremely displeasing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though Rider was the host of the banquet, Archer was the one who
        provided the wine. What on earth is the meaning of this? This is an
        action which would indirectly dirty the reputation of the King of
        Heroes. Shouldn't Tokiomi be able to understand that?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Mm…so much confusion!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver sighed rather desperately as he watched the opponents approach.
        Incomprehensible!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This event has far exceeded the regulation and limits of the Heaven’s
        Feel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What's the meaning of this?! Assassin appearing one after the
        other…There was supposed to be only one Servant of each class!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Watching the awkward expressions of their prey, Assassins laughed
        evilly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You’re correct. We are all acting as one Servant, and each individual
        is only a shadow of the whole.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver and Irisviel could not understand that Kirei Kotomine’s Assassin
        existed in such a strange manner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The Old Man of the Mountain” &ndash; among the people who succeeded the
        name of Hassan-i Sabbāh, only one had the power to switch bodies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Differing from other Hassans, he did not need to modify his body in any
        way. Or, it could be said that there was no purpose in doing so, though
        he was typical in terms of strength, his mind was able to change his
        body freely.
      </p>

        He could use impressive planning and tactics, understand languages of
        other countries, identify poisons or set traps. All in all, he was a
        master assassin &ndash; able to do everything, and switching in
        different abilities based on the requirements of his assignments. It was
        said that on occasions he is able to utilize strange strength and
        agility to use illusionary fighting styles that had been long forgotten.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could disguise as man or woman, youth or elder &ndash; anything! He
        could stand quite naturally next to you. Sometimes, he could even change
        personality based on situation so no one can guess at his real identity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nobody knew the truth. Hassan may have had a unique body, but he had
        many different souls.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The knowledge at the time could not think of multiple personality
        disorder as an illness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With said definition in modern medical sciences, it was a source of
        arcane “power” to Hassan the assassin. He could use the multiple
        personalities within him to use all kinds of different skills and draw
        upon their knowledge, confusing their opponents or weaving a web of
        defense, and kill their opponents with unexpected methods that no one
        could predict.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is the assassin that Kirei had summoned &ndash; "The Hundred-Faced
        Hassan".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He is a Servant that had one physical body, but at the same time
        possessed a thousand different souls. Analyzing from this basis, “they”
        were initially different souls in the first place, and since they are
        now no longer limited by the physical body, “they” can now all
        materialize simultaneously into different shapes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, their strength was also limited to being just one person, and
        after their split the Assassins cannot hope to match the other Heroic
        Spirits. But because they possess the unique skills of the Assassin
        class, they were unparalleled in terms of spying and gathering recon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You mean…we’ve always been watched by these things until today?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel murmured painfully as Saber also shivered unconsciously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though the opposition was not powerful, they were numerous and were able
        to sneak up on the group. Though she was the most powerful Servant, they
        were still a huge threat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, the Assassins that normally followed them like shadows had
        now abandoned their ability of presence concealment and fearlessly
        showing their figures, this meant…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“They meant business.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber gritted her teeth as she realized that they had fallen into an
        unexpected trap.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A group of rabble that relied on their numerical strength &ndash; if
        confronting in a frontal assault, there was no way Saber could lose.
        However, that scenario was limited to the situation only &ndash; if
        there was only Saber to fight the battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, Saber must protect Irisviel. No matter how weak Assassins
        were, they were exceptionally dangerous to humans. Even to Irisviel, a
        homunculus who could use magecraft flawlessly. However, magecraft alone
        could not stop Assassin &ndash; there was no way she could be depended
        to defend herself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, if she wanted to protect her companion and fight at the same time,
        the pressing question at hand was the numerical superiority of their
        enemies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With one strike of her sword, how many Assassins could Saber stop? No,
        the question is no longer how many she could stop. If she missed but one
        person, that one might cause massive damage to Irisviel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, the question is not “Could she stop them?” but is "With one
        blow, could she stop all of them at once?" And then with the number of
        Assassins surrounding them now, it was incredibly hopeless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, from the Assassin's perspective, this strategy was their final
        resort.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though they fought in a group, this group was still limited in
        numbers. Sacrificing the most, exchanging for small amounts of survivors
        &ndash; this method of victory is equivalent to a suicidal charge, which
        is why it is only reserved for final battles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Assassin, as a Servant, wanted the Holy Grail as well. They should not
        be able to stand the fact that they were merely a chess piece in Tōsaka
        and Archer’s game &ndash; but, they were unable to resist the Command
        Seal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For tonight’s operation, Kotomine Kirei used a Command Seal. The order
        was “Victory no matter what sort of losses.” The Command Seal was an
        absolute order to Servants, and thus, they could only follow it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though it made them feel happy that Saber was disturbed and fearful, in
        reality she was not their target. Their target was Rider’s Master. Even
        though Rider had a powerful Noble Phantasm, its destructive powers are
        unidirectional. If Assassin attacked from all sides, they should... no,
        they must be able to strike at the wimpy short Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yes, for the King of Conquerors Alexander, it was a precarious moment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But…why is the large Servant still drinking happily, as if nothing had
        happened?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…Ri &ndash;Rider, Oi, OI….”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite Waver’s shouting in discomfort, Rider still didn’t act. He
        scanned the Assassins around him, his expression still quite even.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hey, kid, don't panic. It’s just a few new guests to the banquet.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“How in the world do they look like guests?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider laughed wryly and sighed, he then greeted the Assassins that
        surrounded him with an idiotically calm expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Fellows, could you relax a little and cut down the creepiness? As you
        can see, you are scaring our friends.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber thought she heard him wrong. This time, even Archer’s brows
        creased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “King of Conquerors. Are you trying to invite them as well?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Of course, the king’s words should be heard by everyone, so if someone
        showed up to hear, it doesn’t matter if they’re friend or foe.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider said calmly as he scooped a spoonful of the red sake in the barrel
        and handed it to the Assassins.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Here, don’t be shy &ndash; if you want to drink with me there are cups
        over there. This wine is as your blood.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre5">Hyunn</i>, the sound of something flying through the
        empty space answered Rider's invitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only the handle of the ladle remained in Rider’s hand; the spoon part
        has already fallen onto the ground. This was the work of one of the
        Assassins. The wine in the ladle fell scattered onto the grounds of the
        center courtyard.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider lowered his head and stared at the wine scattered on the ground
        wordlessly. The skull masks laughed in derision.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Did you hear what I said wrongly?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider’s words were calm, but clearly, the intent and tone changed. The
        only ones able to detect this change were the two that drank with him
        before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I said, “this wine is as your blood,” right? Since you dare to spill it
        onto the ground, then inevitably…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">At that moment, a whirlwind roared to life.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The wind was scorching hot and dry, as if it wanted to consume
        everything. The wind didn’t feel like it should come from the evening
        forest, or the castle’s court &ndash; the way it was roaring, it seemed
        that it came from the desert.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver spat as he tasted sand in his mouth. Sand! It was really sand that
        the strange wind brought. Truly the hot sand was not supposed to exist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Saber, and Archer, the last question of the banquet &ndash; is the king
        lonesome?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider shouted as he stood in the center of the raging desert wind. His
        cape danced atop his shoulders. Somehow, he had already changed back
        into the proper garb of the King of Conquerors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer's mouth moved, and he sniggered. There was no need to answer. He
        replied with his silence instead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber did not hesitate either. If her own beliefs were shaken, it would
        be a flat denial of her days spent as king.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“A king...has no choice to be lonesome!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider laughed. As if responding to the laugh, the whirlwind grew
        stronger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Wrong, wrong!! That answer is almost as good as having no answers! Let
        me teach you two today what it means to be a true king!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The unknown hot wind inverted, and eroded the reality.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the strange phenomenon occurring tonight, distance and position had
        lost its meaning. The raging sandstorm changed all it touched.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“How-How could this..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver and Irisviel gasped in surprise…only ones who understood magecraft
        could understand the phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“A…Reality Marble-?!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The earth-scorching sun; the cloudless, clear skies; stretching to the
        blurry end of the sandy horizon, there was nothing that obscured vision.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To think that the Einsbern castle could be changed suddenly meant that
        it was undoubtedly the illusion of something that eroded away the
        reality. It can be said that this is the uppermost limits of the
        miracles of magecraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “How could this be….you could materialize the environment inside your
        mind…You aren’t a &ndash; magus?!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Of course I’m not. This is not something I can do alone.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Alexander laughed proudly as he majestically stood in the center of
        wide, everstretching field.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This land is the land in which my army once crossed. It is imprinted
        upon the hearts of every single one of my warriors who shared in my joys
        and sorrows.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the world changed, the positions of the five who were initially
        surrounded also changed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Assassins, originally surrounding the group have been moved aside to
        one side. Rider stood in the center. In the other side stood Saber,
        Archer, and the two Masters. This is to say that Rider stood before the
        Assassins by himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &ndash; but, could it be said that Rider fought alone?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The eyes of everyone widened as they noticed the mirage-like images that
        appeared around him. One, two, four….there were more and more images,
        ever increasing. The colors become clearer and more solid.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The reason why this world can exist again... is because it is printed
        upon <i class="calibre5">all</i> of our hearts.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under their expressions of total shock, heavily armed cavalry
        materialized beside Alexander. Though their faces and equipments
        differed, their muscular bodies and mighty chargers displayed a
        fierceness that could only be found in a true army.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only one person present understood what this situation meant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“All of these beings…are servants!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was the only Master here, and so he understood. Servant Alexander's
        trump card, his true noble phantasm, was now appearing before his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“BEHOLD, MY PEERLESS ARMY!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Conquerors stood before the lines of cavalry and raised both
        of his arms to the skies, shouting with immeasurable pride.

        EX rank anti-army Noble Phantasm; the consecutive summon of multiple
        independent Servants.

        The Lord of war, the Maharaorajah, and the founders of many dynasties
        &ndash; the peerless array of heroic spirits gathered here were only
        heard reverently in legends. All of the famed warriors standing here
        &ndash; all of them once fought beside Alexander the Great.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A riderless horse galloped towards Rider. It was a powerful and sleek
        steed. If it was human, it is probably just as impressive as any one of
        the Heroic Spirits standing before the king.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Long time no see, pal.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider smiled childishly as he hugged the neck of his horse. “She” was
        the legendary charger Bucephalus. Even the horse of the King of
        Conquerors became an Heroic Spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Apart from shock and admiration, everyone was speechless. Even Archer,
        who also possessed a rank EX Noble Phantasm, was utterly silent after
        seeing such a radiant army.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These heroes rode alongside their king on the battlefield; their wager,
        like the king’s, was the king’s dream.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not even death could stop their ending loyalty. The King of Conquerors
        turned it into a fitting Noble Phantasm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber was shaken to her core. It wasn’t the strength of the Noble
        Phantasm that she was afraid of, it was the fact that such a Noble
        Phantasm had de-stabilized her beliefs. It shook the beliefs that she
        held in pride.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This flawless cooperation…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This bond with subjects that became a Noble Phantasm...
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was something that the idealistic King of Knights pursued for her
        whole life, yet even to the end, it was something she could not obtain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The King - lives to the fullest!! He needs to live more fully than
        anyone else! He is a figure of admiration to his people!!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider’s voice boomed as he sat atop his beloved steed. The Heroic
        Spirits began smashing their weapons against their shields, shouting in
        unison.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “He gathered the will of every courageous being! He marched toward that
        dream and began his long conquest! That is our king! Thus-”

        “The King is never lonesome! For his wishes are our wishes!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Indeed! Indeed! Indeed!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The majestic cries of the Heroic Spirits pierced the heavens and flew
        among the stars. No matter what they faced &ndash; enemy or fortress, it
        was powerless before the King of Conquerors and his loyal friends. Such
        was their spirit they could cross the earth. With this spirit, they
        could split the very oceans.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And thus, the Assassins standing before them was as insignificant as
        clouds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Alright, Assassin. Let us begin.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider's smiling eyes were full of ruthlessness and cruelty. To someone
        who ignored the king’s words and declined the king’s gift, he no longer
        cared to hold back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “As you can see, my preferred battlefield is the plains. Sorry, but if
        it's about winning by numbers, I believe I have the advantage?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The hundred faces among the Hassans had forgotten about the Holy Grail
        at this moment. Forgetting victory and the mission of the Command Seal,
        they had already lost sense of themselves as a Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some ran away, while some screamed fruitlessly. Some others stood dumbly
        on their spots. The panicked mob of skull masks were indeed just a group
        of rabble.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Trample them!!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Rider commanded without hesitation.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"AAAALaLaLaLaLaie!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The collective roar of the Ionian Hetairoi echoed in response. The
        peerless army that once swept across continents once again thundered
        across the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This was no longer a battle. It was a massacre.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The results of using a mill to grind a sesame seed would yield more
        response.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">

        rode, there was not a trace of Assassins remaining. Only a faint, faint
        smell of blood and some dust that was swept away remained in the air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“WOOOOOOOAAAAAA!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a cheer of victory, the warriors gave dedications and praise to the
        king. Soon, with their mission completed, they returned to spirit form
        and disappeared into the distance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And as such, the bounded field generated by these heroes also
        disappeared. Everyone vanished as if a bubble had been popped. The scene
        returned to the night air. The people present once again stood in the
        courtyard of the Einsbern castle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The white, clear moonlight was silent. There was nothing in the night
        air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Servants and two magi returned to their previous seats,
        raising their cups once more. The ladle &ndash; sliced to bits by the
        dirk &ndash; stood as a testimony to all that happened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&mdash;How disappointing.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if nothing had happened, Rider quietly murmured to himself as he
        finished the wine in his cup. Saber said nothing, and Archer smirked
        with the slightest hint of an unsatisfied expression. 　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Indeed, no matter how weak the mongrels, it must have been quite the
        effort for you, the king, to take down this many, mm? Rider, you’re
        really a thorn in my eyes.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Of course, let’s get this straight, no matter what, we shall have a
        match to see which one of us is better.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not offended in the least, Rider smiled as he stood up.　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Anyways, we’ve said all we wanted to say, right? Let us stop here for
        today.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But Saber was still dwelling on Rider’s words, and she didn’t want to
        let him off the hook so easily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Hold on, Rider, I’m not finished &ndash;“</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“You, shut up.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tensely, Rider stopped Saber’s comment.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Tonight was a banquet among kings. However, Saber! I do not recognize
        your kingship anymore!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Do you still plan to mock me, Rider?"　　</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber’s tone already held a great amount of irritation, but Alexander
        only looked at her with pity. Pulling out his sword, he waved it in the
        air. Suddenly, in a thunderous roar, a chariot drawn by divine bulls
        appeared alongside the roar. Though it was not nearly as impressive as
        the Ionian Hetairoi, it was still wonderous to behold.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Hurry up, kid. Climb on.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Oy, kid?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“---Ah? Ah…um…”　　</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever after he personally witnessed Assassin’s effortless defeat, Waver’s
        heart was strangely covered by some shadow. Though it was the first time
        he had ever seen such an irregular, out of the norm Noble Phantasm, so
        his reaction was natural. Besides, it was his own Servant’s true
        strength &ndash; it was the first time he had seen it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unsteadily, Waver crawled onto the chariot. Alexander gave Saber one
        last glance as he began to speak with sincerity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Know what, little girl? It would be better for you to wake quickly from
        that painful dream of yours. Or else, there’s going to come a day where
        you’ll lose even the self-respect of a hero &ndash; the kingship you
        spoke of, that’s just a spell you put upon yourself. That is all.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“No, I &ndash;“</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ignoring Saber’s final retort, the chariot with flashing lightning flew
        into the skies. In the end, the only thing left was the sound of thunder
        as the chariot disappeared in the eastern skies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To Saber, because Rider refused to listen to her speak to the last, she
        naturally felt wronged. Yet now, what Saber could not drop no matter
        what was a unreasonable sense of worry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No mercy, no ideals, a king whose rule was based on violence in order to
        fulfill his own desires. Yet, even so, there was a group of such loyal
        followers, who was willing to swear an unbreakable fealty to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was anathema to the King of Knight’s ideals. She could not accept
        such beliefs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yet, Saber could not simply treat Alexander’s words as a joke, either.
        There would come a time, where she would force him to take these words
        back &ndash; such words bothered Saber like a thorn in her side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ignore him, Saber. All you have to do is follow in your own beliefs.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, the person who interjected was Archer, who had been mocking
        him for all this time. Hearing such strange words of encouragement,
        Saber answered icily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You were mocking me moments ago, yet you want to flatter me now,
        Archer?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Of course! Your way of kingship is the only way, without a fraction of
        an error. Of course, to your frail body, it must be such a great burden.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Such bitterness… such tangled webs… I couldn’t help but to sincerely
        wish to comfort you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Proper outer appearance, a serious voice, yet there was still an
        unlimited amount of lust and maliciousness hidden within his expression
        and tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As long as this golden Servant existed before her eyes, Saber would
        never have a single moment of confusion. Unlike Rider, who was someone
        she could communicate in words with, Archer was only an unforgivable
        enemy to her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Continue on your path of righteousness, Saber, and clown along the way.
        I like it. Saber, make me happy, and maybe I’ll reward you with the Holy
        Grail?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The white jade goblet shattered in Archer’s hands.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Rider has already left, the banquet is long over &ndash; Archer, leave
        now, or draw your sword.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though it was invisible, Saber’s waving sword nonetheless unleashed a
        powerful pressure. Archer, with broken goblet in hand, had no
        discernible change in expression. Either he was exceptionally brave or
        exceptionally stupid. Only one of the aforementioned possibilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Oy, oy. Did you know, countless nations have been destroyed because of
        this cup? Ah, whatever, punishing you is pointless either way &ndash;
        punishing a clown like you is not fitting behavior for a king.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Quiet. I’ll warn you only once. Next time, I’ll cut through you
        mercilessly!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ignoring Saber’s warning, Archer smiled as he stood up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Try harder, O King of Knights. Sometimes, I think you’re still pretty
        cute.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As his last words faded, Archer vanished as he turned to spirit form. As
        if awaking from a dream, the courtyard, without the golden light shining
        upon it, contained only emptiness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">And, as such, the curtains fell on a battle.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though it was different from battle by a normal definition, but, it was
        indeed a conflict. In order to fulfill the belief of kingship, the
        Heroic Spirits also had many reasons that they must wager their lives
        on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As all her opponents disappeared Saber stood silently, alone, in the
        courtyard. Irisviel couldn’t help but to feel that the scenario was
        familiar &ndash; wasn't such a lonely shadow the same as in yesterday's
        skirmish in the warehouse street?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yet today, there was not a single shred of satisfaction upon her face
        even after she had defeated powerful opponents. The thoughtful, yet
        depressing expression made Irisiviel feel uncomfortable. 　　 “Saber……”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “When I was shouting at Rider, if he were willing to stop and listen to
        me, what would I have said?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was unclear who the question was addressing. Saber turned around as
        she smiled dryly, perhaps laughing at herself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I remember &ndash; ‘King Arthur could not understand the heart of
        others.’ Once, a knight who had left me told me that.”　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“….”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Perhaps it was &ndash; among the Knights of the Round Table, the
        thoughts of a particular knight.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Irisviel shook her head as she spoke to Saber:</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Saber, you’re the king of ideals. Your Noble Phantasm is proof of
        this.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just like Rider’s “<span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Army of the King" class="calibre9"
            >Ionian Hetairoi</span
          ></span
        >” Saber also possessed “<span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Sword of Promised Victory" class="calibre9"
            >Excalibur</span
          ></span
        >” If the King of Conqueror’s Noble Phantasm was his commanding
        abilities, then the King of Knight’s Noble Phantasm was the physical
        actualization of her ideals. The proud aura in which it exhibited was
        undeniable by anyone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Of course, I wanted to become an ideal. In order to make no mistakes,
        in order to be blameless, I had no emotions and never expressed my
        feelings.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Giving up herself for the duty of the king.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In comparison to the limitless desire of the King of Conquerors, the
        road was far more distant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “As long as the battle could be won, and the administration just, then I
        was a perfect king. Therefore, I wanted no understanding. Even if people
        thought I was arrogant and lonesome, I suppose that’s also the rightful
        expression of the king.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But why &ndash; why am I unable to be proud of my own beliefs like
        Rider?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now, Irisviel finally understood Saber’s confusion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The tragic ending of King Arthur was one in which everyone forsook her.
        Because she was unable to gain her follower’s sincere admiration, the
        honor of the King of Knights was tarnished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&mdash;Saber, even if fate cannot be avoided, no one said it’s set in
        stone.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">After a moment of silence, Irisviel finally spoke.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What do you mean?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Fate is not something that’s predestined. The turn of the world, luck,
        and many unexpected events are the things that determine the final shape
        of destiny.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, your destruction was not destined just because you were the King
        of Knights. Thus, you should strive for the Holy Grail.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…Yes, you’re right.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Once, the king’s magician told her, if she pulled out the Sword of
        Destiny, then she was walking towards an unavoidable destruction. Even
        so, she had no regrets.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though she understood, she never really understood its meaning.
        Even if she couldn’t believe in hope, she still wanted her hope to be
        true.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, even as she personally witnessed the predicted end in the
        prophecy, that was when she could no longer accept the reality.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">There was only prayers, only despairing hope.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She wondered if she made a mistake along the way somewhere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The way she had selected &ndash; there should have been a more
        appropriate ending…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The thought turned her into a Heroic Spirit and guided her to the Holy
        Grail of Fuyuki.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Thank you, Irisviel. I almost lost the thing that was most precious to
        me.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber nodded, her eyes were as peaceful and clear as before, shining
        with a confident radiance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “My deeds as king, I cannot get any answers now. I should be asking the
        Holy Grail. Thus, that’s why I’m here.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Yes, you’re precisely right.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel sighed in relief. The proud King of Knights doesn't suit the
        thoughtfully reminiscing, sad expression on her face. Following her own
        beliefs &ndash; that was what she should look like. That shining sword,
        also promised her victory.
      </p>

        <br class="calibre6" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Miyama, the underground basement of the Tōsaka manor was currently
        surrounded by a bitterly stifling silence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “That Noble Phantasm of Rider’s…what is its power level?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Heavily speaking into the communicator, Tokiomi asked Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The same rank as Gilgamesh’s Gate of Babylon. In other words, Rank EX.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">A sigh followed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he had anticipated. Assassin’s sacrifice was not meaningless
        &ndash; at least, he was able to figure out Rider’s trump card. If he
        had no knowledge against Rider as he fought him, Tōsaka probably
        couldn’t do a thing against that super Noble Phantasm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only thing that exceed their expectations, was the rank of the Noble
        Phantasm &ndash; even if he knew about it ahead of time, could he find a
        way to defeat it?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As before, he had always thought his own Servant, Archer’s Noble
        Phantasm was the strongest. However, unexpectedly, a Servant appeared
        with the same level as Archer’s own. This far exceeded his expectations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now, a rare sense of regret slowly floated into the foremost thoughts of
        Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps throwing away the playing piece of Assassin was a deadly
        mistake. Against such a dangerous opponent like Rider, it may have been
        better for him to send a scout to gather information instead of risking
        a frontal assault. If he could run into a case where Rider and his
        Master moved separately, he might have even been able to use an
        assassination…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Idiot.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi shook his head. It was his own fault. This wasn’t a strategy
        &ndash; it was only his random thoughts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yet, the situation was not desperate. There were many things that could
        still cheer him up. For example, Alexander's Master was only a
        third-rate magus. If the person who summoned him was Lord El-Melloi, the
        situation would have been much worse. The ability parameters of the
        Servant was also heavily dependent on the ability of the Master. Did he
        not also use the result of Kayneth’s dispute with his student? Looks
        like all the luck in this fourth Heaven’s Feel was on his side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looks like it was time for business. Tokiomi took his wooden staff as he
        calmly yet firmly stroked it. His life’s work was found in the gigantic
        gem that was framed near the handle, sealing a lifetime’s worth of
        prana.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Since Assassin is no more, Kirei, you should not be saving your own
        strength any more.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Yes, understood."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Across the other side came Kirei Kotomine’s quiet yet deep voice. This
        first-rate student and Executor, even though he had lost his Servant,
        still possessed a large degree of combat ability. Now, because he could
        no longer command Assassin, he had no need to disguise himself &ndash;
        it was time for him to unleash his own abilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As predicted, the second part have begun. Based on the information
        gathered by Assassin, he shall mobilize Gilgamesh and begin his assault.
        As for the solution against Rider, he’ll slowly find an answer to that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finally, it was time to step out of his territory and step into the
        battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Silently enduring the pains of the Magic Crests, Tokiomi stood from his
        chair.
