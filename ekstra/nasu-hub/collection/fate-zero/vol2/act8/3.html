      <p class="calibre3">―Eventually, they somehow did it.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The interior of the sewer Waver discovered, was indeed the haunts of
        non-humans. Possessing countless tentacles, the innumerable aquatic
        monsters stayed there as if crowding together in the narrow tunnel,
        lying in wait to strangle any pitiful trespasser to death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Naturally, although he was shown such a disgusting scene, for Alexander,
        the King of Conquerors, there was no other remedy apart from one.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“AAAALaLaLaLaie!!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The trampling rampage of Gordius Wheel • Wheel of Heaven's Authority in
        the sewer was just like a lightning-clad excavator. The body fluids and
        pieces of flesh of the monsters which was ran down, trampled and
        scorched, thickly filled the inside of the tunnel like a fog. Together
        on the carriage, it was as if Waver could not see his surroundings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Riding alongside Rider at the coachman's box, if the protection field
        were not covering them, he would surely become not able to breathe, and
        would probably suffocate due to the splashing of blood from overflowing
        demons. In spite of that, the more he protected his breathing organs
        with magecraft shields, the more he had to block his sense of smell. If
        not, he would probably faint from the excessively heavy stench of
        intestines.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He thought they would be welcomed with some intricate and mysterious
        defense...but this time, the nest Caster established had nothing but an
        enormous number of familiars positioned there; besides that, magecraft
        disguises or traps were completely absent. Compared with the standard of
        magi, this was neither a workshop nor anything else. It was just an
        ordinary “siege” used to position their army, to strengthen their
        defence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Defence like this which only relied on the number of the small fries,
        was not a suitable prey for Servants furnished with Anti-Army Noble
        Phantasms. Therefore, for Rider, this was but a resistance-less turn of
        events, an anticlimax.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hey boy, you said “attacking the magus' workshop”, but it's just this
        childish thing?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “......No, this is weird. This time, the Caster is probably not a proper
        magus.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Aah? What d'ya mean by that?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “For example, in the legends during his lifetime, be it summoning
        demons, or possessing grimoires or that sort, with just that anecdote
        being passed down, and that person himself is not really a magus,
        contrary to what he is famous for, even if he were to be appear as
        Caster, won't that ability be something limited?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After being made to shun his body senses for about a few minutes due to
        the shrieks of the creatures which were being ran down, Waver now raised
        his voice undauntedly against the sounds of the clamorous massacre, as
        he related at great length that carefree analysis, to the extent of his
        nerves getting numb.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Generally, if this is the real workshop, such a defenseless discharging
        of thrash would be strange. If he were a decent magus, such a blunder is
        impossible.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Huuuh, so that's it? ......Hmm? Are we about to reach the end?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The wall of flesh of the pulverized creatures which were trying in vain
        to block their path, had thinned down before they realized. Before long,
        there was no more tentacle left; and the chariot was released from the
        blood spray, springing into a wide space. Just like before, the
        surrounding was in pitch darkness, without even a ray of light. There
        was no flow of air as well, but they could no longer feel the oppressive
        feeling like when they were in that narrow, confined space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“―Fuuun, unfortunately, Caster's not around...”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Probably, there was no problem for a Servant's eyesight even within this
        complete darkness. Rider coughed absent-mindedly. He had said that in a
        strangely low tone, probably because of his disappointment at letting
        the enemy escape, but at this time, Waver did not realize as well.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“A water tank? Or what is it? Here......”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had wanted a hand light, but if by any chance they would end up in a
        place where there were troops lying in ambush within this darkness, it
        would be something which informs them their direct position. It would be
        great if he could enhance his vision with his magecraft skills and see
        through the darkness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “......Aah, boy. I think it's better for you not to look.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was rare for Rider to be this frank. At his excuse which was as if
        there was something stuck in between his teeth, obviously Waver would
        become astonished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What are you talking about!? If Caster is not here, we have to at least
        find out some clue as to where he is!!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “That's probably true but, oh well. Boy, that guy is too much for you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Shut up!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Becoming serious of the turn of events which were meant to be, Waver
        jumped down from the driver's seat of the chariot and stood on the
        floor, and activated his night vision skill. Instantly, his field of
        vision opened up like a fog clearing up, and the spectacle ahead of him
        which was masked by the darkness earlier, opened up as well.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Until the moment he tried to understand the situation around him, he had
        forgotten how he blocked the odor which had been hanging in the air of
        the sewer, even until here. He had been thinking all this while that the
        splashing sound of the water when he jumped onto the floor, was merely
        because of the sewage water.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“...Wh-wha―”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver Velvet is a magus. He prepared his heart for the every type of
        mystery whose reasoning were outside his ethics.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He knew that the ritual he was participating in now was one with
        unparalleled brutal murders, and thus, did not spare any sweet feeling
        towards them. If he had not conceptualize himself seeing dead bodies
        piling up, he would not have any tinge of hope of staying in this fight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of that, Waver resolved to never be shaken, whatever the “death”
        which might spring out surprisingly into his sight. Because this Fuyuki
        is the battleground, it is natural to see dead bodies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if their numbers were enormous, even if they were to be mutilated
        till losing their entire human appearance―in the end, corpses are still
        but corpses. He would frown at such goriness and atrocity, but there was
        nothing he could not tolerate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had been thinking about this. Until this very instant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The limits of Waver's imagination were that corpses were but remains of
        human bodies in the end; nothing but the result of their destruction.
        However, the scene before his very eyes now, surpassed his previous
        thought completely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As an illustration, that place was just like a variety shop.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were furniture. There were clothes as well. Musical instruments;
        cutlery. Various items uses of which were not understood at all; they
        probably were just pictures or artworks. The enthusiasm of the creator
        devoting himself completely into designing them diligently, and his
        profligate sense of fun could be perceived.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unmistakably, the craftsman who made these ceaselessly loved his raw
        materials, and the manufacturing process itself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They understood that there was someone who violently discovered
        pleasures. That might be the person who committed those murders. But the
        things in this blood-stained space were not corpses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There wasn't a single “destroyed remains” here. Everything was a new
        creation; an art. Their lives as “human beings”, their carcass as “human
        beings” were completely discarded meaninglessly during the process of
        the art―that was the entirety of the slaughter at that place.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Murders which were done creatively to amuse himself; this behavior which
        created art by means of death, had far exceeded the maximum level
        Waver's mind could possibly take. Above simple emotions like horror and
        disgust, at such a graphically realistic and alarming shock, Waver could
        not even stand straight. Before he realized, he was already on the
        bloodstained floor on both his hands and knees, regurgitating all the
        contents of his stomach.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider descended from his chariot. Standing beside Waver, he sighed
        deeply.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“That's why, eh...I've asked you to stop, but...”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Shut up!!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the gigantic Servant's coughing murmur―within his demoralized heart,
        the last bit of self-dignity was scattered into fire sparks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His intense outburst of fury had no reason or logic whatsoever. Kneeling
        here, his weakness was detestable. Of all times, for this weakness to be
        revealed in front of his Servant was an utterly mortifying humiliation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Son of a bitch! Treating me as an idiot! Dammit!!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Now's not the time to get into temper. Idiot.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider spat that out with a sigh, and yet, for some reason, he was not
        amazed, nor did he reproach Waver. Instead, his voice could be heard in
        a quiet, admonishing tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It's okay, that's all for now. If there is someone who would not twitch
        and eyebrow even after being shown such a thing, I'll go and bash him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rather, I praise your decision, boy. The plan of bringing Caster and his
        Master down first is true indeed. Now I see, every second such people
        exist is disgusting.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“......”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was commended by Rider, Waver could not be honestly glad at
        all. The reason he set Caster as his target was to get the supplementary
        Command Spell shown by the supervisor as a reward. Obviously, he did not
        tell Rider that. That's because there would be no reason for a Servant
        to rejoice in the unnecessary increase of the Command Spells which bind
        them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Among those words Rider said to Waver, none of them bear malice. And
        yet, Waver strongly loathed that towering Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not show even the respectful attitude Servants normally have
        towards their Masters. On the contrary, he kept having this behavior of
        treating Waver as an idiot. If that was all, then it's still all right.
        But, the things which is most unforgivable was- despite his rare
        attempts to praise Waver, at such moments, he had such irrelevant
        misunderstanding towards him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What are you hitting me for!? Idiot! Aren't you standing there
        unconcerned!? Am I not the only one who's ashamed!?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though he was vomiting heavily until tears came out, with a furious
        voice, he snapped at Rider with all his might. At that, in an extremely
        troubled manner, Rider's mouth formed a “へ” shape.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “For me, now's not the time to brace your emotions. That's because my
        Master's about to be killed.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“...Eh?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not even having the free time to doubt what he heard, Rider's next move
        was executed with lightning speed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He threw the Sword of Cypriot he removed from the sheath at his waist
        overhead, which gave off bright sparks in the empty space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After that, riding on ahead with a bird-of-prey-like agility despite his
        big size, with the sword which returned to him, he took a swift slash.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sound of meat being ripped apart and getting wet. A scream of agony
        and splatter of crimson red blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With utter disbelief, Waver was staring at the black-clothed corpse
        which had fallen over.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When on earth did that attacker steal up behind Waver? And then, since
        when did Rider sense that presence? As for the thing Rider's sword
        knocked off just now, it was something the shadow clothed in black aimed
        and threw at him- a Dark dagger. With the throw of that dagger, Rider
        was able to finally ascertain the exact position of the enemy. Within
        the instant he did not expect, this bloodstained water tank had already
        become a battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, above everything else, the thing which stared bewilderedly at
        Waver was a white skull mask of the dark shadow which fell due to
        Rider's decapitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Assassin......It can't be...”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was an impossible mystery. That's because Waver had seen the defeat
        and annihilation of Assassin himself through the eyes of his familiar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Now's not the time to be shocked, boy.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With his sword in readied, Rider quietly warned him. As if confronting
        the guy who was shielding Waver, in the darkness, two more white skull
        masks appeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Wh-Wh-Wh-Why!? ......Why are there four Assassins!?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“No matter what it is, it's not the issue now.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing such an obviously abnormal situation, Rider's attitude was still
        very composed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter how fishy the course of events was, to him, the situation
        right now was his only concern.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “There is one thing which can definitely be said of this- Those who
        thought that THESE GUYS had died, have been deceived...”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Anyhow, Rider who was protecting Waver now, was not shaken at all.
        Perceiving that situation, the two Assassins clicked their tongues
        within their hearts regretfully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In reality, to them, this turn of events was a completely inexcusable
        fiasco.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Apart from the two which were dispatched out, among the Assassins which
        were deployed to observe Caster and his master, Ryuunosuke, there were
        still three left outside the workshop, watching them all the time- these
        three people.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If possible, they had wanted to take the opportunity of Caster's absence
        to steal into the workshop to investigate the place. But since they did
        not know what was inside Caster's base, they had no choice but to be
        cautious. However, witnessing how Rider and his master who had appeared,
        foolishly attacking it head on from the front, the three of them decided
        that it was a great chance. Secretly pursuing them from the opening
        Rider made, they planned to find out the status of the defense of the
        workshop, if the situation permitted it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even so, Rider managed to reach the interior of the workshop without any
        trouble. So unexpectedly, the Assassins managed to penetrate Caster's
        base too. One of the Assassins who was satisfied with this unexpected
        turn of events became greedily obsessed. With the extremely defenseless
        Rider's Master ahead of them, he could not resist straying from their
        duty.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Obviously, it was a clear deviation from their Master, Kirei's
        instructions. Despite that, if they could successfully eliminate Rider
        here, they would probably not be reprimanded. To the Assassins, the
        situation was that attractive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Eventually, the three agreed upon an extreme gamble. In the end, it was
        a superb failure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the remaining two Assassins prudently discerned Rider's next
        move, they cast an asking glance at each other. Should they continue
        their two-on-one battle against Rider here......
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without much contemplation, both of them had only one answer. Ever since
        the moment they lost their surprise attack, their chance of victory was
        already lost. Visually measuring the difference in strength between them
        and Rider, they had absolutely no chance of winning. They resented it,
        but retreating here and facing Kirei's wrath would be many times better
        than being slain here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as they mutually understood each other, both Assassins turned
        into spiritual form swiftly, and their figures disappeared from Rider's
        sight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“They...escaped?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “No,” Rider admonished Waver who had started to feel relieved.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Although two had died, there are still two left. If this trend
        continues, we don't know how many more Assassins would come forth. This
        is a bad place. A terrain those guys like. We have to retreat
        immediately.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Still not sheathing the sword, Rider hit Waver's chin, and pointed
        towards the chariot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Boy, get back to my chariot! Once we start off, the enemy won't have
        any chance to strike.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“This place......should we leave it as it is?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Pointing at the workshop which he was still timid to directly look at
        until now, Waver asked that in a gloomy voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Although we might know something if we investigate further......give it
        up! For the time being, we'll just wreck this place whatever we can. Who
        knows if it might end up frustrating Caster's plans?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With his attitude changing suddenly from just now when he trampled on
        the opposing demons outside the workshop, Rider was now more cautious.
        Although some part of him still wanted to advance on the
        grotesque-looking demonic beasts recklessly, the assassins' shadows
        which had drew near them without them noticing, had probably made him
        felt quite seriously threatened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Are there any survivors...”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver said that in a dim voice. After surveying the surrounding
        deliberately with a glance which penetrated the darkness, Rider shook
        his head with a bitter face.

      <p class="calibre3">
        “There are some of them who are still breathing, but......in that
        condition, it would be more merciful to kill them off.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver did not feel him brave enough to ask what Rider had seen within
        the dark.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Both of them boarded the driver's seat of the chariot again. Rider took
        up the reins, and the raging bulls bellowed angrily, sending lightning
        in the darkness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Sorry for the cramped space, but there's something I really count on
        you, Children of Zeus. Burn this place down to ashes!!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Together with Rider's yell, the heavenly oxen stomped their hoofs,
        savagely going around the workshop which was stained with blood as if
        depicting a “円” (Yen) character. Once being trampled on by the hoofs
        which scorched even the air, the only thing left was utter destruction.
        The nightmarish handicrafts Caster and Ryuunosuke treasured so much were
        swept cleanly without any trace in the blink of an eye. Moreover, the
        chariot went about like this for two or three times, and nothing was
        left in the interior of the spacious water tank apart from the heavy
        stench of burned fat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Surveying the aftermath of the sheer destruction, Waver's expression was
        still gloomy. Something like this would not bring about any solution at
        all. Having this miserable thought, the apprentice magus' heart
        squirmed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With his big hand, Rider grimly gave Waver a gentle rub at his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Wrecking his base like this, even if Caster escapes, he can't hide
        anywhere at all. After this, he might come out staggering, confused.
        Singing requiem for that guy doesn't sound too far-fetched, does it?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Wa- Got it! -Stop that!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that humiliating treatment which intentionally emphasized on his
        short stature, Waver cast away his sad look and became exasperated.
        While laughing boldly, Rider pulled at his bridle, and they sped back to
        the sewer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dashing out of that narrow tunnel into the river surface of the Mion
        river under the night sky took only a little time. Savouring the clean,
        chilly air outside as if it had been a long time, the relieved feeling
        finally calmed Waver's nerves down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Oh my, what a stinky place that was. Tonight, I want to have a grand
        booze to get these feelings off my chest!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “......Let me get this straight first. I won't accompany you in
        drinking.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Or rather, he couldn't drink. Every time, even by merely sitting beside
        Rider watching him drink sake, Waver would feel sick at the strong odor
        of alcohol.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hmph, I'm not even expecting this chick-like you to accompany me!
        Aaaahhh~Boring! Isn't there any river bank where I can get happily
        drunk? ......Oooh, that's it!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre5">Pomp!!</i> Rider clapped his hands together
        knowingly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver had absolutely no idea what that meant, but he had a really bad
        feeling about it.
