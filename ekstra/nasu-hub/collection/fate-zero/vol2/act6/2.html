      <h2 id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre2">-130:55:11</h2>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber turned into a gust of roaring wind and galloped in the forest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now Saber no longer cared about her disagreements with Kiritsugu. Her
        heart would turn into a sword once at the battlefield. A sword whetted
        matchlessly sharp and gleaming. It is a sword that had not a sliver of
        doubt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber knew very clearly that she was running into Caster’s battle array
        of magecraft. Her blood was boiling; the evils that this devil had
        committed made Saber furious. But what’s pushing Saber forward at the
        moment wasn’t her furious mood. Anger and hatred alone would not be able
        to turn Saber’s heart into a sharp sword.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those slaughtered children. It wasn’t as if Saber hasn’t seen such
        scenes before. As long as one is at the battlefield, no matter how
        unbearable one finds such things to be, those small carcasses would
        still be seen. For her, who was once King Arthur, it was an ordinary
        situation seen all the time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The so-called humans, once they stand at the edge of life and death,
        would turn incomparably ugly, despicable and violent. Humans are
        two-legged beasts that ravished women, slaughtered children, and robbed
        the poor. Nine out of ten times the blood-stained battlefield would
        become full of such demons.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, precisely because of that, humans need to ‘prove’ themselves
        even if they have sunken into Hell. Prove that humans can still live on
        with dignity no matter what difficulties surround them. Someone is
        needed to prove and testify to that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The one who can testify to that is the knight. The shining star on the
        battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A knight must proudly illuminate the entire battlefield by inspiring awe
        with his justice. He needs to let those fallen souls, reduced to demons,
        to again pick up honor and pride, and become proper humans once more.
        Putting aside his own anger, sadness and anguish and focus on the
        greater good: that is the duty a knight must bear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, Saber must defeat Caster. This isn’t the urge of anger but
        her duty.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber had to admit such actions are lacking in careful consideration.
        She couldn’t help it if someone rebukes that she acted too hastily.
        However, Saber isn’t someone with only brawn and no brains. Although she
        predicted that Caster would be a tough enemy, she did not despair;
        because it’s not as if she has no hope for victory. If it is going to be
        a fight to the death, the last person standing would be her &ndash; that
        was Saber’s intuition.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster must be defeated. Different from Kiritsugu, Saber had her reasons
        to defeat Caster by her own hand. She must subdue that devil even if she
        suffers heavy wounds and damages her strength. This is the duty of the
        King of Knights, an inescapable obligation. A devil that sullied the
        meaning of war, a scum that humiliated the pride of humans; Saber would
        never let such a person go.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The stench of blood became heavier. The mud that wrapped about the edge
        of her armor stopped Saber’s steps.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Behind Saber, the ground was clouded with raised dust, and the disturbed
        dust was soaked through with dampness. That dampness wasn’t caused by
        rain, but crimson blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a sickening stench. A sea of blood surrounded her. Just what kind
        of cruel slaughter did Caster go through to create such an unbearable
        scene? Saber’s heart was torn apart with pain when she thought of this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And the ones slaughtered were all young and lovely children. Saber
        remembered those children, screaming with terror, which she saw in the
        crystal ball. That was something that happened just then. Just a few
        minutes ago, before Saber galloped into the forest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back then they were still lively children. Now they’ve already turned
        into scattered carcasses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You’re finally here. Jeanne, I’ve waited a long time.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster greeted the stationary silver-white figure with a hearty smile.
        Caster’s face was full of complacent smiles as if he was very satisfied
        with the lavish ‘banquet’ he was holding. Caster stood in the middle of
        this sea of blood; his inky black cassock was covered with the fresh
        blood of the hostages, making his smile more spooky and terrifying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What do you think about this tragic scene? Mortifying? Could you even
        imagine the anguish those innocent and lovely children went through at
        their end?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But Jeanne, this still isn’t a true tragedy. Compared to after I’ve
        lost you, in order to meet you again &ndash;”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber had nothing to say, and she had no intention to listen to Caster’s
        long speech either. She wanted to cleave Caster in half with one sword
        blow; with no hesitation left, she took a step towards Caster.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster also detected the killing intent in Saber’s advancing step and
        stopped talking, suddenly pulling his hands out from the edges of his
        cassock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The thing that was hidden in front of Caster’s chest once again made
        Saber stop her advance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a child &ndash; the sole surviving hostage. He was still sobbing
        weakly as Caster’s forearms held him close. Did Caster leave him alive
        just to use him as a shield in the battle against Saber?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Oh Jeanne, your flaming and anger-filled eyes are so
        appealing.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster, feeling relaxed, smiled briefly towards Saber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Do you hate me so much? Yes, you should hate me. I betrayed the mercy
        and love of God and you would never forgive me for that. You were truly
        more devoted to God than anyone else.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Let that child go.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The tone Saber used to command Caster was as cold as a blade.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This competition for the Holy Grail is to select the Heroic Spirit most
        worthy of obtaining the Grail. If you use strategies that sully Heroic
        Spirits, you will be abandoned by the Holy Grail.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Since you’ve already been resurrected, the Holy Grail is useless to me…
        Jeanne, if you really want to save this child’s life.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Then, with his face full of
        disappointment, he softly let go of his grip and placed the child on the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Don’t cry, child. You should be happy. God’s devoted disciple came to
        save you. The omnipotent God finally answered to your wishes. None of
        your friends received God’s salvation, except you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It seemed that the young child also understood that this blonde girl who
        sprinted here was his saviour, and began to cry loudly at once. At the
        same time he ran straight towards Saber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The child’s little hands clasped Saber’s shin guard. Saber’s fingertips
        softly brushed past the child’s hands. The only thing that can envelope
        the child and give her solace was the mountains surrounding them.
        Currently Saber was in a very desperate situation. She could no longer
        prepare for battle and take care of the child’s safety at the same time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It’s very dangerous here. Get away quickly. Run this way, and then
        you’ll see a big big castle. In there people will help &ndash;”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clack, the child’s spine made a sound. His sobs became painful wails.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber was shocked beyond words; the little figure in front of her eyes
        burst apart. Moreover, what gushed out from within the child was not red
        blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was an inky horde of snakes, countless snakes intertwined together
        &ndash; no, that thing was covered with suckers as big as fish gills,
        not something as simple as a group of snakes. Are they octopi? Or the
        tentacles of some strange octopus-like creature? Those tentacles, as
        thick as Saber’s arms, extended in the blink of an eye and wrapped
        themselves around the silver armor, starting to tightly constrain
        Saber’s arms and legs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The flesh and blood of the hostage still hung on the demonic monsters
        summoned from another world &ndash; there was more than one demonic
        monster surrounding Saber. Endless tentacles continued to emerge from
        the remains of the hostages scattered everywhere; a dozen or so monsters
        surrounded Saber almost immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those monsters are about the same size. They have no limbs or a lower
        body, making them impossible to describe with words. There is a circular
        mouth at the end of each one of those endless tentacles. The mouths
        contain razor-sharp teeth like a shark’s. Although the origins of those
        creatures are unknown, they’re definitely not living beings of nature.
        They might be creatures from another world, and that world does not obey
        the natural laws.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I should have told you beforehand, you should make full preparations
        the next time you see me.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster laughed loudly as if celebrating his victory. As he spoke, a
        thick book appeared in his hands. The cover of the book was wet and
        glistening and, unbelievably, a piece of human skin was placed on it. It
        is only an ordinary book by the look of it, but with Saber’s
        lightning-like senses she could tell that massive amounts of prana
        surged around with the book as its center and expanded outwards. Without
        a doubt, that book is Caster’s Noble Phantasm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This is the magical book my friend and ally left for me. I obtained the
        means to lead armies of demons using this book. What do you think? Is it
        that no other army can stand up to the majesty of my demonic army?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber didn’t reply. She was still tightly bound by the tentacles. The
        rotten and smashed formless carcass still remained in her hands. Those
        demonic monsters consume the flesh of the hostages as they emerge;
        therefore the remains of the carcass no longer had any solid weight.
        That kid was just crying and clutching to the edge of her clothes a
        minute before; now it was already reduced to this tragic state.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; That’s enough. I don’t want to compete for the Grail with you
        anymore.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The swordsman Servant, Saber, said quietly. At the same time, she
        released the anger that has been roaring and fuming in her heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The demonic monsters began to retreat backwards. Compared to sound
        waves, that impact wave brought more force to Caster’s eardrums.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What erupted from the slender body of the girl was a yell of
        blood-churning anger &ndash; and a huge burst of prana. Those tentacles
        that surrounded Saber’s entire body didn’t endure even a second of her
        prana burst. They broke into slivers of flesh in the blink of an eye,
        scattered away and disappeared. Not a trace of the slime that enveloped
        Saber lingered on her; the silver armor regained its brilliant shine.
        Amid the hordes of demonic monsters, the girl stood like the god of war,
        and glared at Caster with burning eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I ask for nothing in this battle, and I don’t want to obtain anything
        either. But now… this sword in my hands is made to eliminate you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ohhhh, Jeanne…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster was awed by Saber’s majesty, and began to gasp weakly. His
        expression &ndash; it’s not one of doubt or fear, but slightly lost and
        confused.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “So noble, so just… Oh holy maiden, even gods fall to shame in front of
        you!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster’s voice was extraordinarily happy, but suddenly he sank into
        silence. Taking that as their signal, the fragile tentacles lashed
        towards Saber like an avalanche.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I have stained my love! I haven sunken into love’s bog! Oh holy maid!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The swinging sword and the mad laughter lifted the curtains of this
        battle to the death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre6" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre7">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre6" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel held her breath and gazed unblinkingly at the turn of the
        battle in the crystal ball.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The uncanny matter Saber had predicted was also already very obvious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Considering the special abilities of Servant classes, Saber has an
        overwhelming advantage over Caster when they battle. When she achieved
        the class of the Heroic Spirit of the sword her ability of magic
        resistance was increased in magnitudes. If Caster uses magecraft as his
        main weapon and intensively resists Saber upfront, then he has not the
        smallest amount of chance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">But &ndash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Caster is a magus who can summon evil demons.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber’s magic resistance ability can only be activated when someone
        targets her to use magecraft. It can not stop Caster from summoning
        monsters from other worlds. Moreover, once those monsters are summoned,
        they would materialize and carry a threat different from magecraft. The
        teeth and curved claws of the monsters have attack powers equal to
        swords. The only things Saber could use are her sword and body when
        facing those monsters.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But even so, Saber, the mightiest in armed battle, would not fear any
        mere monsters summoned from another world. That is most certain.
        However, that is something she could only do when her body has no
        wounds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The battle of the forest reflected in the crystal ball was definitely
        not an optimistic situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Faced with the monstrous tentacles that continuously attacked her, Saber
        didn’t move back a single step. She still maintained the swift and
        ferocious attacking posture. Every time Saber waved the invisible sharp
        sword in her hands, monsters would be cleaved apart in the air. Those
        hordes of tentacles did not manage to go near the girl Servant a single
        step.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber is completely capable of pushing back the monsters’ attacks, but
        those monsters attacked one wave after another &ndash; this means Saber
        was already in a bad situation where she has to defend with all her
        might.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Saber can defeat the opposing army with her vicious swordplay,
        Caster was merely standing far away with ease and watching her fight.
        Saber couldn’t even get one step closer to the leader of the monsters,
        Caster.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless new monsters with their tentacles continued to grow out of
        places where they were severed, and endless monsters also emerged from
        the pools of blood soaking the earth. Those monsters surrounded Saber in
        layers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That invisible sword and the continuously summoned and materializing
        monsters were in a situation where their powers were completely equal to
        each other. This means Caster holds the reins for this battle. That
        magus wasn’t trying to get a quick victory but moved step by step,
        maneuvering just enough forces needed to combat Saber, and got the
        battle into a deadlock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It seems like Caster planned to fight a drawn-out battle. He wants to
        tire Saber out, exhaust all her energy, and then finish Saber off with
        one blow. Moreover, right now Saber was completely stuck in Caster’s
        trap.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps the situation would have been different if Saber wasn’t wounded.
        It’d be a piece of cake for Saber to handle this group of weaklings.
        However, now Saber’s left hand was troubled by that curse. Saber’s
        expression could be seen through the crystal ball; she was evidently
        very anxious about not being able to fight as she wishes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Still no sign of other Masters entering the forest at the moment?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu’s question came from behind Irisviel. Obviously, Kiritsugu
        didn’t care too much about Saber’s problematic situation. Irisviel was
        extremely disappointed with Kiritsugu. However, Kiritsugu looked like he
        didn’t notice his wife’s disappointment and just silently prepared his
        weapons. Kiritsugu placed various grenades and small machine guns into
        the suspender beneath his jacket. This is something quite unbelievable,
        the preparation of a magus about to enter battle &ndash; however,
        Irisviel saw that the holster by Kiritsugu’s waist contained the
        magecraft single-loader that Kiritsugu only carried at crucial moments.
        She understood that her husband had made the preparation to fight the
        best he could.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Maiya, escape the castle with Iri. Go in the opposite direction of
        Saber.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya nodded undoubtedly when she heard Kiritsugu’s command. But
        Irisviel couldn’t conceal the uncertainty in her heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Can’t I… stay here?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Saber is fighting far away from here, which means this castle is no
        longer safe because others would think the same as I do. So it’s very
        dangerous here.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Someone may really want to take advantage of this and attack Saber’s
        Master in the short period of time when Saber is away from the castle.
        The best time to kill a Master is when the Master and Servant were
        acting separated from each other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Between a Master under the protection of his Servant, and a magus that
        guards his headquarters all by himself, which one of those two enemies
        is easier to defeat? &ndash; Kiritsugu would definitely choose the
        latter. If another magus chose the same answer as Kiritsugu, he would
        certainly attack Irisviel, who remained in the castle, once he knew that
        Saber was fighting alone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She had finally met up with Kiritsugu, but they are about to be
        separated again; this made Irisviel very unsettled. She became more
        unsettled when she detected the pain and conflict Kiritsugu hid in his
        heart. However, she’s only a burden if she stays by Kiritsugu’s side.
        After all, meeting with Kiritsugu in the castle is already a breach of
