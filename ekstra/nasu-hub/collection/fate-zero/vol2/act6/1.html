      <p class="calibre3">
        Head straight westward from Fuyuki’s busy streets for about thirty
        kilometers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There is an east-west orientated state highway that cut through tall
        mountains far removed from villages and devoid of human presence. A
        stretch of dense forest occupied both sides of the highway, and this
        piece of forest seemed forgotten by the torrential upsurge of land
        development.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maybe this land is state-owned, but based on its register it appears to
        be owned privately by an overseas company; moreover, it is yet
        unconfirmed whether this overseas company truly exists. If someone
        insists on investigating this land, then the first baffling thing would
        be this legendary urban myth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It is rumored that in the deepest part of this dense forest, there
        exists a ‘legendary castle’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, this myth is only a boring fairytale. Although the forest is
        undeveloped it is still only about an hour’s drive away from Fuyuki
        city. If there truly is such an outlandish castle then everyone would
        know about it. In fact, people have conducted land surveys in this
        primeval forest numerous times and have not once found any traces of
        human structures.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But after every few years, someone would bring that myth up again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A group of children once walked into this forest half-playfully,
        half-exploring, and there was also a lost hitchhiker. They saw an
        ancient castle suddenly appearing out of the dense fog; it was built out
        of rock and immensely spectacular. No one lived inside the castle and it
        appeared to be abandoned. But within it there were all sorts of
        utilities and everything was in perfect order, and people couldn’t help
        but have the illusion that humans indeed live here. It is said to be an
        extremely uncanny ancient castle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Obviously no one would believe in this rumor. The best it can be is a
        story told by tabloids that have ran out of news material, which used
        one page in their summer special edition devoted to strange tales to
        pass it across.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only a very small amount of magi know that this castle truly exists.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This castle only welcomes the owner that enters here to participate in
        the war every sixty years; all in all, it is a castle of the way of
        magecraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This castle is enveloped by multiple layers of illusions and bounded
        fields, and would never be exposed to the outside except in rare
        accidents. This is a strange space of existence. The people who know of
        the castle’s existence call this dense forest ‘the Einzbern forest’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When Fuyuki held the Heaven’s Feel Jubstacheit, the head of the Einzbern
        family, felt that it is an inappropriate move to establish an outpost on
        the land directly subjected to their archrival Tohsaka family.
        Therefore, he fully used the financial power of his clan and bought all
        the leyline covered grounds closest to Fuyuki as the Einzbern family’s
        headquarters. That was near the beginning of the third Heaven’s Feel,
        which also coincided with the tense and dangerous times just before the
        onset of the Second World War.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This broad primeval forest is covered with a bounded field and
        completely isolated to the outside world, and the Einzbern family
        transferred everything in their original castle into this forest. From
        this act, the Einzbern’s immense financial power and their extraordinary
        persistence in pursuing the Holy Grail can be seen. Compared to the
        Einzberns, the various negotiations the Tohsakas had to make in order to
        purchase land at Fuyuki and the pains they put in to concealing it all
        would be a mere laughing matter.

      <p class="calibre3">
        The dense atmosphere made Irisviel sigh numerous times.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; Are you tired, Iri?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu asked. Irisviel hid her melancholic expression and shook her
        head with a smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“It’s nothing, I’m not tired. Keep going.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel urged Kiritsugu. Kiritsugu continued to talk about all sorts of
        intelligence concerning Fuyuki city. A map portraying the entire Fuyuki
        city was spread on the table in front of Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Two locations are the heart of the entire area. One is the
        residence of the Second Master, Tohsaka. The other goes without saying;
        that is Mount Enzō. All the leylines in the surrounding area gather at
        Mount Enzō. The details are just as Head of the Household Acht had said
        &ndash; “
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Servants arrived at the castle before Irisviel and company did and had
        prepared everything appropriately at the meeting place before leaving.
        Therefore, the meeting place where the meeting was being held was
        immaculate. Not a speck of dust gathered anywhere from table legs to tea
        cups, and vases were filled with lively flowers. It’s impossible to
        imagine that no one has lived here for sixty years.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It’d be a lie to say that she’s not tired. But Irisviel had at least
        rested in bed for a little while. Kiritsugu, on the other hand, didn’t
        rest for one minute. It was already near noon when Kiritsugu and his
        assistant Hisau Maiya arrived at the castle. However, as soon as they
        arrived at the castle they received the summons from Fuyuki church,
        controlled familiars, confirmed the notice from the supervisor and such,
        and Kiritsugu busily dealt with all these hassles without a halt. Last
        night, after the battle at the warehouses, Kiritsugu and company
        attacked Lancer’s Master Kayneth, and even encountered Kotomine Kirei.
        Another fierce battle ensued. Yet, Kiritsugu didn’t even show a sliver
        of exhaustion, then there’s no reason for Irisviel to complain of
        tiredness either.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No, there were other, hidden reasons for Irisviel to sigh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; A powerful bounded field was established with the Ryūdō temple
        on top of Mount Enzō as its base. As a result, apart from Servants, all
        other natural creatures can only enter the bounded field through the
        mountain path. Saber needs to be careful of this when she’s moving.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These words advising caution to Saber could be directly said to Saber
        face to face. However, Kiritsugu still didn’t even once look at the girl
        dressed in masculine attire and standing behind Irisviel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were two reasons why the air became stagnant and heavy. One was
        that Saber displayed an attitude of absolute refusal towards Kiritsugu.
        This attitude of Saber’s didn’t form just now, but it only became more
        obvious since they arrived at Einzbern castle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Also, apart from these two locations, there are two more key positions
        in Shinto where leylines gather. One is the Fuyuki church on top of the
        southern hill, and the other is the new housing development to the east
        of the CBD. To conclude, there are four key spiritual grounds in Fuyuki
        where it is properly equipped to carry out the Holy Grail’s descent.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then, once the war enters the ending phase and the number of Servants
        have been narrowed down, we must take control of one of these
        locations?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Correct. Any questions concerning the topography?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...Saber, is there anything you are not certain of?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel did the tactful thing and tried to arouse her interest. The
        girl Servant smiled and shook her head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Nothing in particular. It was a sufficient explanation."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While the girl in question is probably not aware, from an observer's
        point of view it was a sarcastic, flippant reply.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">With a sigh, Irisviel continued.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, as for our policies from now on... It seems all the other Masters
        will hunt down Caster first, right, Kiritsugu?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yeah, that seems to be the case. The supervisor did hint that there
        would be compensation for the effort."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A while ago, Kiritsugu told them about the announcement from the Fuyuki
        Church, and the supervisor's revision of the rules; the perverse nature
        of the Servant Caster and the supervisor's backing in stopping him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "However, concerning this Caster, it would be more advantageous if we
        did not join with the other Masters. After all, as of this moment we are
        the only ones who know his true name... Baron Gilles de Rais."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu, his lips crooked by a cynical smile, continued.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "He must have lost his mind if he's prowling after Saber like that,
        thinking that she is Joan of Arc. This guy is useful. We don't even need
        to drive him away, just set our nets and wait."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Master, that is not enough."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was the cold, objecting voice of Saber, who had thus far been
        secluded from the discussion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "With Caster's personality, if we do nothing and simply watch over him,
        then the number of innocent victims will only increase. His misdeeds are
        unacceptable. We should force him out before the damage spreads."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps Saber hoped that, with her sincere words, she could pass through
        the wall surrounding Kiritsugu's heart; if so, then it was futile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As ever, Kiritsugu, with no indication that he even heard Saber's voice,
        spoke again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It'll be fine, Iri. We found no openings in the boundary field, and the
        alarm and scanning systems have already been checked..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Biting her lip, Saber's expression became grimmer as she stared as
        Kiritsugu. While Saber could forcibly endure the way Kiritsugu ignored
        her, the righteous indignation that he would let Caster do as he wish
        was too much.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, Emiya Kiritsugu could not be any less concerned by Saber's
        stare.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We weren't going to use the castle this time, but the situation has
        changed. Until we can lure Caster in, we will hold our position in this
        fortress."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "... But Kiritsugu, don't we need to think of a way to deal with Lancer
        first?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel gave a counterpoint on behalf of the ignored Saber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It has been eight hours since you defeated Lord El-Melloi, yet Saber's
        left hand still won't heal."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If the curse of that spear doesn't disappear, it means Lancer is still
        fine. Unlike Archer and his Independant Action skill, the Servant Lancer
        cannot remain for a long time in the present world without a Master."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu quickly nodded to what his wife was pointing out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's certain. Maybe Lancer formed a new contract with a new Master,
        or I failed in killing Kayneth... a hindrance came up and prevented me
        from checking out he was dead."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If so, in order to face Caster more safely, don’t we need to defeat
        Lancer first?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, faced with Irisviel’s continuous questions, Kiritsugu shook his
        head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “We have no need to confront Caster directly when he appears. All you
        need to do is to use the advantage of the terrain to the maximum. Saber
        can just run away and confuse the enemy’s line of sight.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel was shocked. When Saber heard this from Kiritsugu, she was
        gaping with anger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Not… fighting Caster?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “All the other Masters have set their aim at Caster. Someone is bound to
        deal with Caster without us lifting a finger. Therefore, we have no need
        to commit this extra act.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Caster is rich picking for all those Masters who are chasing Caster
        with bloodshot eyes. Caster’s sight is locked on Saber. As long as
        Caster makes a move, then one or two of the Masters pursuing Caster
        would definitely set foot in this forest and we can attack these Masters
        sideways. The Master who gave pursuing Caster all their attention would
        never think that they would change from the role of the hunter to the
        hunted.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was it; such was creditably Kiritsugu’s strategy. In Kiritsugu’s
        eyes there are no human morals or the pride of being a magus. He is only
        a predatory machine deducted from the formula of the survival of the
        fittest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu originally didn’t plan to come to this castle. Irisviel
        finally understood Kiritsugu’s intention in suddenly changing his plans
        and joining forces with her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Master, you… just how despicable do you want to be?!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber rebuked loudly and angrily, and Irisviel also felt a faint pang in
        her heart. Saber’s indignation right now was different from the anger
        she had last night due to Rider’s mockery and Caster’s boasting &ndash;
        in some ways this was an even more furious anger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Emiya Kiritsugu, you’re insulting the Heroic Spirits.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I only joined this war to avoid spilling rivers of blood. Fight for the
        Holy Grail, no meaningless bloodshed, minimize sacrifices, one person
        taking up the mission of fate instead of armies of men and competing
        here… this is what we Servants should do.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Why don’t you give me the responsibility of joining the battle? You
        were just like that when you attacked Lancer’s Master last night. One
        misstep had resulted in a disaster. I have already made a deal with
        Lancer to fight again! You don’t need to use such despicable means
        &ndash; or is it that Kiritsugu doesn’t have faith in me, who is a
        Servant?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu didn’t reply. He kept an indifferent silence as if Saber’s
        furious words were mere trifles. Irisviel hated that mask-like
        expression of indifference on Kiritsugu’s face to no end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">That man was not the husband she knew.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She indeed knew that the person Emiya Kiritsugu has dual personalities.
        She detected that on the one hand Kiritsugu invested all his emotions to
        his wife and daughter, and on the other hand he hid the scars of the
        past in his heart. Irisviel knew something about what kind of life
        Kiritsugu lived before he entered the Einzbern family. But was that the
        decisive factor that caused the split between them?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Also, the factor that helped Irisviel to realize this was that
        black-clad woman present in the meeting. That woman didn’t speak a
        single word, and silently entrusted everything she has to Kiritsugu.
        That woman was the other reason why Irisviel was feeling melancholic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It wasn’t the first time she’s seen Hisau Maiya. She had seen Hisau
        Maiya a few times in the Einzbern castle. It was Hisau Maiya who managed
        all of Kiritsugu’s worldly businesses outside during the nine years of
        Kiritsugu’s seclusion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The woman who acted with Kiritsugu before he met Irisviel. In the
        duration of this meeting, she didn’t have a sliver of doubt towards
        Kiritsugu’s words and kept her adamant silence. Perhaps, for Maiya, the
        Kiritsugu right now was the Emiya Kiritsugu she knew.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, a faint aroma drifted into Irisviel’s nose. It was the smell
        of tobacco. That scent of tobacco had always been with Kiritsugu, from
        the day she met him. Irisviel still remembered that she detested that
        smell a lot back then.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She hadn’t smelt that scent for a long time after she married Kiritsugu.
        Now, the scent of tobacco again emanated from Kiritsugu. Perhaps that is
        the gunpowder smell of the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The current Kiritsugu had undoubtedly returned to the Kiritsugu nine
        years ago. Back then, in order to win the Holy Grail, Acht took
        Kiritsugu in. Kiritsugu was like a cruel and merciless hound.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And the Irisviel back then was merely a doll guarding the Holy Grail. As
        she reminisced Kiritsugu’s past, it was almost as if Irisviel was
        remembering her own past. As if the nine years the two of them lived
        together no longer existed. Irisviel’s heart started to become fretful
        and restless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, the person closest to the man Emiya Kiritsugu was not her,
        who is his wife, but Hisau Maiya…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel did not say what she was thinking of, but asked a completely
        irrelevant question:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… How should we deal with the new rule of the war the supervisor had
        proposed? Didn’t he want us to enter a ceasefire with all enemies apart
        from Caster?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ignore that new rule. The supervisor only provided the rewards for
        abiding with the new rule, not the details of the punishment you’d get
        if you break the new rule. If the supervisor really buggers us about it,
        we can just pretend we didn’t know about this rule.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Completely different from his attitude when treating Saber, Kiritsugu
        replied to Irisviel’s questions thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Besides, it just doesn’t feel like the supervisor of this war
        can be trusted and respected. Hiding Assassin’s Master as if he knows
        nothing about it; he’s probably on Tohsaka’s side. Before we figure out
        everything about him, we should temporarily regard him with some doubt.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber was so angry her body was shaking, and countless thoughts roamed
        in Irisviel’s heart. For a moment, the two of them both sank into
        silence. Kiritsugu took such a silence as the sign to end the meeting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Then the meeting’s over. Irisviel and I will remain in the castle and
        prepare for Caster’s assault. Maiya is to return to the city and gather
        intelligence. Report it to me if there are any changers there.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Yes sir.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya nodded unhesitatingly, stood up, and left the meeting room.
        Kiritsugu stood up a while later, gathered the map and documents on the
        table, and also left the room. Kiritsugu didn’t look at Saber even once
        until the end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber, completely ignored by Kiritsugu, bit her lip tightly and angrily
        and stared at the carpet beneath her feet. Irisviel and Saber remained
        in the meeting room. Right now, Irisviel didn’t know what words she
        could say to soothe the fuming Saber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No, the proud King of Knights, Saber, wouldn’t expect others to comfort
        her with useless words. Currently, for Saber, the necessary thing to do
        was to resolve the current problem at its root. When she thought of
        this, Irisviel put a hand on Saber’s shoulder to show her gratitude
        towards her, and immediately chased after Kiritsugu and left the meeting
        room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That overwhelmingly deliberate ignorance Kiritsugu showed towards Saber
        &ndash; it wasn’t just because the two of them had different beliefs. If
        Kiritsugu didn’t harbor emotions such as extreme hatred or anger towards
        Saber he wouldn’t be able to act so ignorantly towards her. All in all,
        Kiritsugu had overdone it this time. No matter how much the strategies
        of the two differed, they were still companions fighting for a common
        goal. Although they don’t have to respect each other, they shouldn’t
        humiliate each other either.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel soon discovered Kiritsugu’s figure. He stood on the balcony
        that could overlook the front garden of the castle, leaning on the
        railing, and looked out into the night forest. Fortunately, Maiya’s
        figure wasn’t beside Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Kiritsugu.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel spoke as she slowly walked up to Kiritsugu’s back. She didn’t
        think that her voice would suddenly become severe. Kiritsugu must have
        also felt her presence. Because Kiritsugu didn’t appear surprised at
        all, but turned slowly around.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel was already prepared. Just then, when Kiritsugu confronted
        Saber in the meeting room, a look of such cruelty seeped out of his
        eyes. Irisviel prepared to stare straight into Kiritsugu’s cruel gaze.
        However, when she saw Kiritsugu’s expression when he turned around, she
        couldn’t help but feel helpless and stood rooted to the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu’s expression was like a hurt and helpless child, forcibly
        holding back his tears. Kiritsugu looked as if he’s been driven up
        against a wall. The Kiritsugu standing before Irisviel right now was so
        very remote from the figure of that powerful magus killer; he is only a
        weak and cowardly man.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Kiritsugu, you &ndash;”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu didn’t speak, hugging the confused Irisviel tightly. His chest
        was shaking. In Irisviel’s eyes, her husband’s shoulders were always
        strong and powerful, something others can rely on, but now her husband
        was as helpless as a baby sheltering in the arms of his gentle mother.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“If I &ndash;”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel felt that her husband hugged her tighter, even hurting her.
        Then, her husband’s weak question sounded beside her ear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If right now I decide to throw away everything and run away from here
        &ndash; Iri, will you leave with me?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Probably, Irisviel would never be able to imagine that a man like Emiya
        Kiritsugu would ask such a question. She was so shocked she couldn’t
        speak for a while, and asked back only after a long pause:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ilya… that child is still in the castle. What about her?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “We go back to the castle and bring her out. All who stand in our way
        will be killed.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was a short and crisp sound &ndash; but also full of despair.
        Doubtlessly, Kiritsugu wasn’t joking; he was serious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “After that &ndash; I’ll give everything I have for our family. I’ll
        protect Ilya and you with my life.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now Irisviel finally understood the feeling of this trapped man in front
        of her. Kiritsugu, the partner of her life, was facing the greatest
        battle in his life, and he’s already been forced onto a road of no
        return.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was no longer the Kiritsugu from nine years ago. No longer that cold
        and emotionless hound, no longer that killing machine who endlessly
        chastened himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu had changed. He’s gotten very weak, even forcing himself into
        such a situation to achieve that very cruel ideal. The key that made
        Kiritsugu change was none other but Irisviel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wife and daughter. They weren’t meant to be swept into Emiya Kiritsugu’s
        life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, Kiritsugu had nothing to lose. He couldn’t even feel pain.
        It was precisely because Emiya Kiritsugu was such a man that he can be
        extraordinarily strong, he can pursue the immense ideal of saving the
        world, unhesitatingly sacrifice everything for it, and become a soldier
        whose cruelty knows no bounds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The current Kiritsugu wanted to go back to the past, to be the man he
        was before. But &ndash; at the same time that he remembered the past, in
        the depth of Kiritsugu’s current soul an inconsolable dilemma formed.
        These nine years completely changed Kiritsugu. Kiritsugu was already
        enduring a huge amount of pressure and pain just to maintain the look of
        cruelty and heartlessness he had before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu’s ignorance of Saber was exactly the exposure of Kiritsugu’s
        weakness. Currently, Kiritsugu was already exhausted trying to preserve
        himself. He had no energy to accept Saber, even with no extra energy
        left to communicate to the King of Knights.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel’s heart hurt terribly. The man she loves with all her heart was
        being tormented, but there was nothing she could do. That’s because the
        person that caused all of Kiritsugu’s anguish is herself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only thing Irisviel can do now &ndash; was to weakly raise her doubt
        to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Are we able to run away? We…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“We can. Now there’s still a chance.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu replied immediately. But that wasn’t believable. Kiritsugu
        only said that to allow his own heart to still cherish that illusionary
        hope.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; You’re lying.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">So Irisviel pointed that out, gently, cruelly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “That’s impossible. Emiya Kiritsugu, it’s impossible for you to run
        away.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Give up the Holy Grail, give up the ideal of saving the world; you will
        definitely not forgive such a self. You will definitely be the final
        judge and declare the death penalty for yourself.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu finally cried out. He understood that too. He had no choices
        left since a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I’m so scared…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu sobbed, and spoke of what was in his heart like a child.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “That guy &ndash; Kotomine Kirei locked his aim on me. Maiya told me
        that. That guy used Kayneth as bait to lure me onto his hook. He’s
        already guessed all my plans…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I may lose the battle. I sacrificed you, and left Ilya aside, but
        still… that most dangerous person had already aimed his weapons at me.
        That guy is the enemy I least want to meet!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Emiya Kiritsugu, not a hero nor a warrior, but a killer. He doesn’t have
        the courage and the pride to battle others with his life on the line. He
        is a coward. Therefore, his goal is to cautiously and with the least
        risk ensure his victory and the right to survive. For the hunter, the
        worst nightmare is to be hunted by another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But even so, if it was the Kiritsugu nine years ago, he wouldn’t so much
        as lift an eyebrow and would calmly think up the best solution. That was
        the terror of Kiritsugu when he had no loved ones to lose. But now, when
        the Kiritsugu who is afraid to lose his loved ones faces battles again,
        the fear of losing those he loves became his fatal weakness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I won’t let you fight alone.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel said gently as she caressed her husband’s shaking back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I’ll protect you. Saber will also protect you. And… Maiya will also be
        beside you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel was forced to admit which woman Kiritsugu needs the most at the
        moment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only one person can reawaken the tenacious toughness sealed away in the
        depths of Kiritsugu’s heart, and recall the cruel and heartless
        personality Kiritsugu had many years ago. But Irisviel would never
        mention these to Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Irisviel still had something she could do, then that is to embrace
        Kiritsugu, and let Kiritsugu have some temporary solace. However &ndash;
        Irisviel prayed silently in her heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It wouldn’t matter if her prayers don’t work. She prayed that the time
        she’s allowed to embrace Kiritsugu would be lengthened, even for a
        minute or a second. Then, she can cure Kiritsugu’s pain the best she can
        with her limited strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &ndash; Such prayers and the embrace of the two simultaneously
        disappeared without a trace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel’s chest suddenly throbbed intensively, and she couldn’t help
        but tense up her entire body. Repeating and intensive vibrations
        appeared in her magic circuits as soon as she held the forest’s bounded
        field within her own magecraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">That was the alarm.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; Here already?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Her husband muttered beside her ear. Calmly &ndash; he returned to the
        resolute and cruel tone she still hasn’t gotten used to.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu detected that something had happened just by seeing his wife’s
        expression. Irisviel nodded silently and left her husband’s embrace. The
        cruel countenance of that ‘magus killer’ once again emerged in front of
        her eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Fortunately, he came before Maiya left. Now we can smash him face on
        &ndash; Irisviel, prepare the crystal ball used to look into the
        distance.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Right.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Events were happening much quicker than expected. The whirlwind of
        battle began to blow in the forest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre6" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre7">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre6" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; He’s appeared.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All the main players of the Einzbern camp once again gathered in the
        meeting room &ndash; Kiritsugu, Maiya, and Saber. Before the three of
        them, Irisviel showed the image the bounded field had captured of the
        invader on the crystal ball.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The invader donned an inky black cassock, and an evil aura reeled about
        it. Also, the patterns dyed crimson red on the cloth was as if stained
        with blood, wavering in and out of view in the forest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Is this that Caster?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was the first time Kiritsugu saw Caster. Irisviel nodded towards him.
        The figure reflected on the crystal ball was indeed the weird Heroic
        Spirit that stopped Saber last night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“But, what’s he going to do?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What was making Irisviel puzzled was the fact that Caster led a group of
        people behind him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster didn’t act alone this time. It looks as if he led ten or so
        people behind him, and sauntered forward in the forest. All these people
        were immature children. Even the oldest only looked like primary school
        students. All the children wobbled as they walked like they were
        sleep-walking, while Caster walked at the front leading them on.
        Undoubtedly, these children were controlled by Caster’s magecraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It must be that Caster saw the notice of the supervisor, and kidnapped
        these children from Fuyuki and its surroundings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Iri, what’s the location of that guy?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Within two kilometres northwest of the castle. Looks like Caster
        doesn’t intend to go further into the forest.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The bounded field expanded in the forest is a circle with a diameter of
        five kilometers and has the castle as its center. Caster’s location was
        at the edge of this bounded field.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Caster goes any deeper towards the center of the bounded field, then
        Irisviel can support Saber in battle. However, as if Caster saw through
        Irisviel’s intentions, he started circling around the outside of the
        bounded field.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Irisviel, the enemy is baiting us to come out.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber said resolutely. She needs only a few minutes to arrive at
        Caster’s location just with her speed on foot as a Servant. Saber’s
        thoughts also passed to Irisviel. At that moment, Saber’s mood was
        extremely anxious, and wanted to go out and smash Caster.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But the King of Knights couldn’t do whatever she wanted. The group of
        children gathered behind Caster &ndash; was exactly the reason why the
        King of Knights was feeling unsettled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Hostages… right? Definitely so.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Irisviel muttered melancholically. Saber nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Triggering the pre-set traps and machinations would harm those
        children. Only if I go and defeat Caster can these children be saved.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The current situation was clear without explaining. However, Irisviel
        also had reason for hesitating. Saber’s wound is a great disadvantage
        and it’s worrying to have her fight Caster like this. Irisviel
        instinctively deduced that Caster is a tough enemy. Irisviel couldn’t
        support Saber on the outside of the bounded field. Letting Saber fight
        alone in such a situation…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that time, Caster’s beast-like eyes suddenly looked up. Could it be
        that he had already sensed Irisviel’s “clairvoyance”?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster stared at Irisviel’s direction and flatteringly lifted his arms
        and bowed at Irisviel. It was such a simple thing to do for the magus
        Heroic Spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I came here specially to visit you according to last night’s promise.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The surface of the solid crystal ball began to waver, and sound began to
        be passed along from the surveillance location.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Now, please give the order, to let me be in the presence of that
        beautiful holy maiden again.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber stared at Irisviel, urging her to quickly give a command. The girl
        who was a Servant had already made the preparation to fight. It was only
        her master who was hesitating.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if he saw through Irisviel’s thoughts, Caster showed an expression of
        scorn, spat out a laugh as if he was acting in a one-man’s-show, and
        said:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… Ah, looks like you still can’t make up your mind. I expected to wait
        for a long while too, so just take your time making preparations. C’mon,
        this is such a boring game &ndash; can I borrow a corner of your
        territory?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster clicked his fingers. The children who were obediently following
        Caster’s back all the time opened up their eyes as if waking up from a
        dream. The children looked about themselves helplessly, as if they
        couldn’t figure out where they were.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Listen children, we’re gonna play hide-and-seek. The rules are simple.
        Just run away from me. If I catch you &ndash; “
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster’s hand stretched out from the sleeve of the cassock with a swish,
        and caught a child beside him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Stop!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber knew that her prevention would have no effect, yet she couldn’t
        help but yell out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sound of a skull shattering. Brain matter sprayed in all directions
        and eyeballs slid down in the air. Those nightmarish scenes were
        engraved into everyone’s mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The children let out a harrowing scream and scattered everywhere.
        Caster, standing in the middle, laughed loudly and happily and licked
        his blood-covered fingers with his tongue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hurry up and run. I’m gonna start chasing you after I count to a
        hundred. So Jeanne, before I catch all the children, how long are you
        going to prepare?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel didn’t hesitate anymore when she saw this scene. It was
        impossible for her to hesitate anymore. She is also a child’s mother.

        disappeared from the meeting room when Irisviel heard her reply. Only
        the wind that started to blow behind her was full of extraordinary rage.
