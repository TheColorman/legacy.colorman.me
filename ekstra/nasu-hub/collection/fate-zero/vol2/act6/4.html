      <p class="calibre3">
        It was pure luck that Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald captured Caster’s
        figure in his sight in Fuyuki.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was dumbfounded upon discovering that figure in a inky black
        cloak, obviously from the wrong era, strolling casually along the
        suburban streets at dusk, Kayneth began his chase when he saw Caster
        stopping a small truck that passed by, gave hypnotic suggestions at the
        driver, and then sat in it with the children as if it was a kindergarten
        trip.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A battle between Servants can only be conducted away from other people;
        however, the truck carrying Caster was incidentally driving towards the
        remote mountains far from the city. Kayneth snickered as this suited his
        purpose perfectly, but began to hesitate when he realised their
        destination is the Einsbern forest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He’s already heard of the Einsbern territory near Fuyuki when he
        conducted investigations beforehand. Since it is a territory of magi, it
        would therefore have its matching bounded field, making it a location
        where others would find it hard to battle with an advantage. Despite
        that, leaving aside the true reason for Caster to specially travel here
        &ndash; his intention of challenging the power of the Einsberns is
        obvious. If so, then maybe there’s a chance to gain something in the
        battle. Kayneth made up his mind, and stepped into the forest with
        Lancer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he thought, Caster began fighting Saber, who materialized to
        counter his assault. From his fuddled speech and acts it can be seen
        that Caster, already roaming, is acting alone, but Saber’s Master still
        didn’t appear. He probably deduced that he can protect himself alone
        even if he doesn’t stay beside his Servant since this is in his
        territory, and decided to observe the battle in his headquarters away
        from the frontline.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">So Kayneth decided on his own strategies.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He ordered Lancer to assault Caster. For Kayneth, who has already spent
        one Command Seal, the reward the supervisor brought up concerning
        defeating Caster is something he’d do anything to obtain. However, even
        if he defeats Caster here, it would seem that he’s on the same side as
        Saber. The Einsbern Master would also be given the extra Command Seal.
        It’s something that Kayneth definitely doesn’t want to see.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, Kayneth decided to leave Caster to Lancer, and he himself
        would secretly enter the Einsbern castle alone. If he wants to claim
        Caster’s head as his own, all he has to do is to get rid of Saber’s
        Master at the same time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it is a bold challenge, Kayneth has unshakable confidence in
        himself. No matter what defenses Einsbern had made, he’s willing to bet
        the title of Lord El-Melloi that he is able to break it apart. He’s got
        to show this kind of courage if he wants to amend the defects Sola
        reprimanded him for last night. For Kayneth, the most pressing problem
        for him right now is to have his fiancée take back her insults.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth moved toward the depth of the forest as the seething vigor
        boiled inside him. Although illusionary magecraft has been cast upon the
        forest of the bounded field, Kayneth’s outstanding knowledge and
        instincts allowed him to make precise deductions, and easily found the
        location of the central axis of the bounded field. It wasn’t for nothing
        that he has the mighty title of the greatest genius of spirit
        invocation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the magecraft of the Einsberns is only to such a degree, then just
        how the castle is defended is very clear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth still had enough ease left to snicker. Although many magecraft
        artefacts he brought from England were lost when the hotel collapsed,
        his strongest trump card, his Mystic Code, has always been by his side.
        Therefore, he didn’t feel that his strength in battle weakened at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The trees hindering his sight suddenly disappeared, and the antique
        stone castle appeared before Kayneth. So that is it, one would expect no
        less from these prestigious northern magi; even a relocated castle is a
        building whose size deviated from normality. But Kayneth is also the son
        of the prestigious house of Archibald. Even if the castle’s majesty can
        overwhelm others, the only sentiment it rose from him was a snort.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not bad. After Einsbern is dealt with, it wouldn’t be bad to take this
        castle and make it the new headquarters…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After Kayneth lost the Hyatt hotel suite he had obtained an abandoned
        factory on the outskirts of the city as his temporary base, and hid Sola
        there. Obviously, his fiancée’s mood couldn’t be worse. After all, it’s
        an environment that Kayneth’s pride won’t tolerate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he’s decided on this, then he has to keep the destruction of this
        building at the minimum.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth laughed presumptuously and placed the large porcelain vase he
        carried under his arm on the ground. Once it left his hand, the vase
        sank deeply into the earth. This vase, which was under a spell of weight
        reduction to make it easier to carry, has a true weight approaching 140
        kilograms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "<span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Let my flowing blood seethe." class="calibre9"
            >Fervor, mei sanguis.</span
          ></span
        >"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Once he chanted the spell that activated the magecraft, the thing in the
        vase oozed out from the mouth. That liquid, giving off a mirror-like
        metal sheen, is a large amount of mercury. Flowing out of the vase as if
        it is a disciplined primeval creature, the ten-kilograms-or-so mercury,
        shivering, formed a ball.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Among the many of them in his possession, this is the Mystic Code Lord
        El-Melloi took pride in &ndash; Volumen Hydragyrum • Moon Spirit
        Cerebrospinal Fluid.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "<span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Automated defense." class="calibre9"
            >Automatoportum defensio</span

          ></span
        >"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Following Kayneth’s low chanting, the surface of the mass of mercury
        vibrated and rustled as if answering him, and followed his feet on the
        ground to approach the gates of the castle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth, who possesses the two attributes water and wind, a feat rare
        even among magi, excels in the art of manipulating flow, which is shared
        between these two attributes. He thus created this unique Mystic Code,
        using mercury filled with magecraft as his weapon, and controls it at
        will.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The shapeless mercury, can also be sculpted into any shape &ndash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Scalp!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Kayneth yelled, a part of the mercury ball suddenly became a long and
        thin ribbon extending upwards. Then, the mercury ribbon savagely
        thrashed towards the door like a whip.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As it was about to hit, the mercury whip suddenly compressed itself into
        a thin edge of only a few millimeters thick, becoming a mercury blade as
        sharp as a razor. Attacked by this mercury blade edge, the heavyset bolt
        was cut in half as smoothly as if it was a piece of tofu. The great
        gates collapsed inwards with a heavy groan.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Mercury is a heavy liquid in room temperature; when it moves rapidly
        under high pressure it would possess a mighty kinetic energy. Moreover,
        mercury can change into shapes such as whips, spears, and blades at
        will. Its sharpness can even overwhelm laser rays, rivalling pressurized
        water jet cutters.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps he carries with him the confidence of an assured victory.
        Because, in front of Lord El-Melloi’s Volumen Hydragyrum, even the most
        stolid defense won’t stand a chance. Be it titanium alloys or diamond,
        nothing is unbreakable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth walked leisurely towards the great hall of the castle after he’s
        finished with the obstacle in front of him. The crystal chandelier in
        the hall emanated brilliant light and the marble floor, polished
        extremely smooth, had not a single flaw.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even the air felt extraordinarily still, with only Kayneth’s presence
        &ndash; of course, not a single person came out to greet him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The ninth head of the Archibald house, Kayneth El-Melloi, asks for an
        audience!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth, with an air of command, proclaimed loudly in the deserted hall.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Magus of the Einsbern! For the Holy Grail that you seek, betting your
        life and pride, come out to meet me!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite Kayneth’s taunting declaration, no one responded. It was as if
        they weren’t looking forward to duel with Kayneth. As though he was made
        to look foolish, Kayneth sighed, and walked toward the center of the
        hall with heavy steps.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment Kayneth arrived at the center of the hall, the four flower
        vases placed at the four corners of the hall suddenly exploded with an
        enormous roar. However, it wasn’t porcelain fragments that flew out from
        the explosion but countless metal beads. Those metal beads sprang toward
        Kayneth like bullets.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This machinery was constructed free from magecraft. Kayneth didn’t sense
        any scent of magecraft activation. Therefore, it must be machinery
        Kiritsugu set up in the vases. It is an anti-personnel mine called a
        Claymore, a cruel pre-set bomb. When each bomb explodes they will
        release, simultaneously, 700 or so steel balls with a diameter of only
        about one or two millimeters. These steel balls would radiate outwards
        in all directions in a fan formation, a terrifying weapon that people
        say is made to completely destroy infantry units with one strike. When
        it explodes, one won’t even have time to escape; the only thing the
        target at the center of the bombs can do is prepare to be beaten into a
        sieve.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &ndash; Of course, provided that the target isn’t a magus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the split of a second before 2800 steel balls reached Kayneth, the
        spot he was standing on became enveloped by a silver semi-circle. The
        mass of mercury lying recumbent beside his feet suddenly changed form.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the tight, thin mercury membrane wrapped around Kayneth was
        barely one millimeter thick, its surface tension reached the strength of
        steel when supported with prana supply. Out of the rain of beads that
        the Claymore mines dispersed not one of them hit Kayneth. All they did
        was getting reflected back to the hall and hammered the setups in the
        room into smithereens.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is Volumen Hydragyrum's "automated defense" mode. This pre-set
        magecraft can automatically respond when Kayneth is threatened, forming
        a powerful protective membrane in a split second. This kind of reaction
        speed can even defend from bullets. It was also this defense system
        Volumen Hydragyrum created that protected Kayneth and Sola when the
        Hyatt hotel collapsed. The malleable mercury is a perfect weapon that
        gathered attack and defense all onto itself, being Kayneth’s sword and
        also Kayneth’s shield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"… Hm."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth, after he removed the protective membrane and saw the tragic
        scene around him, snorted with derision at the baseness of the
        machination. Even Kayneth, who didn't know much about military
        equipments, understood that it wasn’t magecraft that assaulted him but
        simply ordinary weapons filled with gunpowder.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth’s mind finally had some idea about the truth concerning the
        unpleasant experience last night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He doesn’t even need to analyze it. Among the other six Masters, the
        only one who wants to destroy Kayneth more than everyone else is Saber’s
        Master, the Einsberns. However, how could the magus of the Einsberns,
        being such a high-born house with eminent prestige, use such a base
        method? Kayneth, who takes pride in being also from a prestigious family
        of mages, found this impossible to believe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However &ndash; now he has to believe this. The one who used explosives
        to destroy Kayneth’s workshop last night with absolutely despicable
        methods is hiding in this castle at this very moment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"… Fallen so low, Einsbern?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth mumbled, with more lamentation than anger in his tone. It
        probably isn’t Saber’s Master himself who used such despicable methods,
        but some lowly guy they hired somewhere else. But even so, it is still a
        very corrupted thing to do. They invited an irrelevant guy onto this
        holy battlefield. This is utterly unforgivable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &ndash; Fine, then it’s not a duel anymore, but my crusade towards you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Arousing his intent to kill once again, Kayneth walked deeper into the
        enemy’s defences.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Through the CCD cameras concealed in the main hall, Kiritsugu
        meticulously observed the power of Volumen Hydragyrum, Lord El-Melloi’s
        pride.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Using spells to manipulate mercury for automatic protection &ndash;
        although he’s heard about this before, he never thought that the real
        thing would have such powerful abilities. Even the shockwave of the
        Claymore mines wouldn’t beat its defense in speed. If that’s the case,
        then he can’t expect to use firearms to obtain victory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Kiritsugu was very annoyed, he had to admit that this magus
        indeed possesses first-rate skills. Actually, when his machination at
        the Hyatt didn’t succeed, he should have known of this already.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In other words, this is an opponent that Kiritsugu must confront as a
        "magus."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, to find the enemy hiding in this castle, Kayneth must be
        searching all of the rooms on the first floor one by one. At the moment
        Kiritsugu is located at the innermost part of the second floor. If he
        acts immediately, he should have enough time to choose a place
        advantageous for him to face the enemy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu analyzed the plan of the castle in his head as he walked out
        of his room and towards the door &ndash; his footsteps stopped.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A drop of mercury, like a thread of cobweb, hung in the door’s keyhole.
        Although it was only a tiny bit of mercury, Kiritsugu could still see it
        drooping toward the ground as it left a silver trail on the surface of
        the door.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The drop of mercury suddenly stopped moving downwards the moment
        Kiritsugu saw it. Then, it retraced its tracks, retreated back through
        the keyhole as if it was alive, and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"… So that’s what it is; an automated search."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immediately following Kiritsugu's bitter words, a ray of silver light
        sprang up from below the salon's carpet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the blink of an eye, a circle was cut out on the floor at the center
        of the room and fell to the ground below. Then a silver tentacle leapt
        up from that circular hole.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In front of Kiritsugu, Volumen Hydragyrum’s new shape was like a
        metallic jellyfish. Endless tentacles grabbed the edge of the opening on
        the floor and their base, in the middle of the tentacles opening out
        like an umbrella, was expanded into a flat, bowl-like platform. And the
        one standing on the platform and smiling was none other than Lord
        El-Melloi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I finally found you. Little mouse…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the triumphant Kayneth ordered the mercury to attack, Kiritsugu
        had already drawn the Calico submachine gun from his waist holster and
        opened fire.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Reacting immediately, Volumen Hydragyrum speedily formed a protective
        membrane in front of Kayneth and blocked all the might of a rain of 9mm
        bullets. It took only a few seconds to empty fifty bullets.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But it’s preciously those few short seconds that gave Kiritsugu more
        than enough time to chant his spell.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Time alter &ndash; double accel!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Following the pronounced spell, the prana inside Kiritsugu began to
        gallop at light speed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Scalp!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth gave the proclamation of death the moment Kiritsugu’s firing
        ceased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two mercury whips that leapt up following his voice flew towards the
        prey in front of them with a pincer formation, attacking from the left
        and right.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hm!?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was Kayneth who gave an exclamation of surprise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment the two silver whips were just about to hit the target,
        Kiritsugu dodged the silver whips’ attack with an almost unbelievable
        speed and quickly leapt below the Volumen Hydragyrum, on which Kayneth
        was standing &ndash; into the hole on the ground that the mercury blade
        just cleaved out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu’s speed was so fast that human eyes couldn’t see his movements
        clearly. No matter how you think about it, it shouldn’t be a physical
        feat ordinary people can perform. Although Kayneth did feel he was a bit
        careless, he wasn’t too surprised with this strange change happening in
        front of his eyes. After all, this is the battle between magi that
        overrides ordinary rules. It wouldn’t be odd even if a little mouse
        mixed into it possesses extraordinary abilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh? Also know a little bit about magecraft?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although a small smile passed across Kayneth’s face, the intent to kill
        was already within his heart. Whether he is an ordinary mouse or not,
        even if he’s had some teaching in magecraft, he is still a lowly man who
        used dirty means. Such actions, which humiliate magi, can not be

        Kayneth flipped the tail of his coat and leapt down to the first floor.

        The mercury’s thin tentacles scattered after receiving his orders, and
        once again scanned through the entire first floor. The mercury
        immediately confirmed the location of the target. Approaching that
        location following the tracks of the tracing mercury, a sliver of a
        bloodthirsty smile emerged on Kayneth’s lips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre6" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu, traversing the corridors, felt that his whole body was being
        devoured by the after effects of using his magecraft.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The skill he used to dodge Kayneth’s Mystic Code just then wasn’t a
        basic physical enchantment. It was an advanced magecraft with a greater
        range of utility &ndash; and obviously with far stronger side effects.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ability to separate the passage of time inside a designated space
        from the "flow of time" in the outside world; in some ways, Time
        Manipulation can be regarded as a type of Reality Marble. Although it is
        classified as a greater magecraft, it is definitely not "magic" which
        cannot be replicated. Compared to "time modification", which can reverse
        cause and effect and change the past, this is merely the magecraft of
        "time adjustment" that can stagnate the time that had passed and
        accelerate the time in the future. Therefore, it is not a magecraft of
        extraordinary difficulty.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only problem one needs to consider is the size of the bounded field
        and the scope of time that needs to be modified.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu’s root, the Emiya family, spent generations researching and
        seeking the magecraft that controls time. The magic crests existing on
        Kiritsugu’s back inherited the fruits of research from generations of
        men. But the amount of prana one needs to spend and the rituals needed
        in preparation to activate this kind of magecraft rivals in magnitude
        with the greater magecrafts. Therefore, it has to be prepared and used
        strategically. For Kiritsugu, who made up his strategies to just survive
        on the battlefield, it was originally a rather useless inheritance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, to use the "time control" ability he’s inherited at the
        maximum, Kiritsugu created a flexible way of utilizing this magecraft at
        a very small scale.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A method that kept the scope of the bounded field within the
        practitioner’s body made it easier to establish a Reality Marble.
        Although it is impossible to completely isolate the flesh from the
        outside world, it can minimize the affect the outside world has on the
        body. Within this minimal bounded field, he "adjusts" just a few seconds
        of time; this is the magecraft that Emiya Kiritsugu created, Innate Time
        Control.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For example, when he fought Kayneth just then, Kirtsugu "sped up" his
        blood flow, haemoglobin metabolism, and muscle movement all at the same
        time. All that’s left is to use his quick reaction time to dodge the
        attack after he easily predicted the track the mercury whips would take.
        Kiritsugu is capable of accomplishing physical feats impossible for
        ordinary humans after he accelerated the time inside his body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The biggest problem for this magecraft is the huge burden on the body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The craft of time modification inevitably creates errors between the
        time within and without the bounded field. This error would immediately
        be corrected by natural forces when the bounded field is removed. That
        is, the "world’s own adjustment". Of course, this adjustment can only
        happen where "errors have occurred", which means inside Kiritsugu’s
        bounded field &ndash; his physical body. Adjustments have occurred in
        his flesh to get back in sync with the normal time flow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Death is the accompanying danger born from using magecraft, but Innate
        Time Control is above all Kiritsugu's riskiest technique. Just now, it
        was as though he was tightrope walking while his flesh was being
        shredded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to Kayneth's unrestricted magecraft, Kiritsugu’s ability is not
        powerful. But this doesn’t mean Kiritsugu has no chances of victory now.
        Because the best chance Kayneth had at killing Kiritsugu &ndash; the
        strike just then &ndash; had already been missed. Although Kayneth may
        have not realized it, for Kiritsugu it was his biggest mistake. Kayneth
        had already exposed the true form of his Mystic Code, and also gave
        Kiritsugu the chance to analyze it. After that, it’s "hunting time" for
        the Magus Killer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he ran, Kiritsugu exchanged the helical magazine on the Calico for a
        new one. The bullet in the Contender were also changed into a normal
        one. It’s still a bit early to use the final killing move. He needed to
        provoke Kayneth even more in order to kill the enemy with one strike.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lord El-Melloi’s mercury Mystic Code united attack and defense, and also
        possessed the ability to search out enemies. However, Kiritsugu had
        already spotted the flaw in this magecraft with its three advantages.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">First, its ability to search for enemies &ndash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu suddenly stopped as he turned a corner, and hid in the shadow
        of a pillar. The mercury wasn’t just approaching from behind him, but
        spreading silently over the entire corridor and getting closer and
        closer. Most likely, the mercury tentacles were spreading out into a
        giant web, and sealing off all of Kiritsugu’s exits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Using liquid metal as a sensory tool &ndash; how is it passing the
        perceived information back? There are no specialized senses such as
        sight, smell, taste, which is why Kayneth can control it so fluently.
        Therefore those ways of communication are out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The most probable would be through touch. But when Kiritsugu was
        discovered at the second floor his location was pinpointed without him
        making contact with the mercury.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, if the mercury is extremely sensitive to touch, then it’d be
        able to make judgements based on vibrations in the air. It should also
        be able to sense differences in air temperature and find a heat source.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu chuckled as he stared at the mercury web approaching from all
        directions. <span class="calibre4">That thing doesn’t have eyes</span>.
        Therefore, if he contorted his heart beat, breathing and body
        temperature, he can make his existence completely transparent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Time alter &ndash; Triple stagnate."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Following the chanting of the spell, Kiritsugu’s field of view suddenly
        became very bright.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, the outer world didn’t make any changes; it’s just his
        delusion. While Kiritsugu’s optic nerves registered whatever he saw, his
        cornea received three times the light a person’s eyes would normally
        receive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The time control this time is the exact opposite of the accelerated
        physical speed back then. Kiritsugu slowed his biological processes to
        one third of its normal speed. His breathing lagged, and his heart beat
        slowed and stagnated until he could barely feel it himself. Also, due to
        his metabolism having stopped, his body temperature declined quickly,
        cooling down until it is not much different from the temperature of the
        outside air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mercury flew abnormally quickly and anxiously in front of Kiritsugu,
        who was as still as a statue. As he expected, the mercury couldn’t
        detect him now. Kiritsugu’s shallow breathing and slow heart beat was
        muddled with the noises of the natural world. The mercury can no longer
        recognize the current processes of Kiritsugu’s body using the standards
        of a human.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The searching mercury web speedily retreated after it deducted that
        there are no signs of the enemy, retracing its steps. The sound of
        footsteps on the marble floor followed. Since he thought no one is here,
        Kayneth walked on without taking any precautions…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Release Alter!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The brightness of his sight and the sharpness of his hearing returned to
        normal in the blink of an eye. Kiritsugu’s heart also began to beat
        extremely quickly; all the blood vessels in his body hurt as if they are
        going to burst. Within his body, blood flow was adjusting to go up to
        three times its original speed. In fact, there must be bruises forming
        somewhere on his body due to internal bleeding coming from burst
        capillaries.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But Kiritsugu already leapt out from behind the pillar before his body
        had fully adjusted. When Kayneth, who just arrived at the corridor,
        reacted, Kiritsugu was about fifteen meters away. He immediately opened
        fire with the Calico in his left hand at the magus whose eyes widened in
        surprise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Kayneth was shocked, the Volumen Hydragyrum still displayed its
        abilities accurately and loyally this time. The protective membrane
        opened up in the blink of an eye and again blocked the storm of 9mm
        bullets. Everything was like a replay of the scene before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"&ndash; Idiot. These are just boring tricks!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was at a loss with the unexpected ambush, Kayneth, hidden
        within the protective membrane, couldn’t help but laugh when he
        discovered that the attack was a shooting as unthreatening as the last
        time. But he didn’t know that the opponent he was mocking had also
        figured out the weakness of his automated defense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the Calico stopped firing, Kiritsugu’s free right hand had
        already pulled out the Contender and fired a shot at center of the
        expanded, semi-circular mercury membrane.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Volumen Hydragyrum had already adapted to the best physical shape to
        protect against the Calico. However, the initial velocity of the .30-06
        Springfield is 2.5 times higher than the 9mm bullets, and its
        destructive power seven times the latter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu had completely seen through the speed of Volumen Hydragyrum,
        which came from pressure. Although a blob of mercury can quickly spread
        out into a membrane faster than a bullet through hydraulic pressure, it
        is impossible to quickly go back to a blob from a membrane using
        pressure alone. That is the limit of hydrodynamics.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, when another sudden massive force is launched against it, the
        mercury can’t react quickly and form a powerful defense &ndash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A big hole was punched right through the mirror-smooth surface of the
        mercury membrane. Judging from Kayneth’s wails inside, the Springfield
        bullet has hit the target.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, he couldn’t even aim at the target hidden behind obstructions.
        Therefore, it was already lucky for him to hit the other man; he
        couldn’t at all expect this attack to give the other a fatal wound.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth’s wails also quickly turned into angry curses, then &ndash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Scalp!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Following a roar full of the intent to kill, the mercury unleashed a
        killing move.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu faced the silver whips roaring towards him with ease. He
        didn’t even need to activate Innate Time Control this time. There were
        more than ten meters between him and Kayneth now. Such a far distance
        was more than enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu pulled back just a bit; you can't hit what you can't reach,
        and the mercury blade only managed to cut the hem of his flowing coat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Volumen Hydragyrum’s characteristics can be grasped by just observing
        its attacks once. Despite being a very fast attack, it is comparatively
        simple.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When mercury is in the shape of a whip it is the base that controls its
        extremely quick attacks, but the tip virtually has no power. The power
        of the blade is basically formed through centrifugal force. For someone
        as experienced as Kiritsugu in melee combat, the path this kind of
        attacks would take is easy to predict. This is also the characteristics
        of controlling mercury with pressure. Only parts with a large mass can
        fully exert its power, while the strength slowly gets weaker towards the
        tip end. Kiritsugu had already analyzed this weakness of its when he
        realized the mercury ends that stretched far from the original mass to
        search for enemies aren’t as agile as the cutting whips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu was running before the opponent could continue to attack. It’d
        be great if the opponent began to chase him immediately, but if the
        other man didn’t chase him and stopped instead to treat the gun wound
        he’s just received, then that means the previous taunt still wasn’t
        enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The blow that penetrated the protective membrane was the first and the
        last. Volumen Hydragyrum’s defense would become firmer once it realizes
        the Contender’s power, which is completely different from that of the
        Calico. In future attacks, all forms of defense should be able to block
        the Springfield bullet as well. Kayneth would certainly utilize all his
        prana to strengthen the mercury’s defense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <span class="calibre4">It wouldn’t be good if he did that.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu, enduring the pain enveloping his body, opened the Contender's
        chamber and pulled out the empty cartridge as he ran. This time, he
        slipped in a magecraft bullet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kayneth would definitely utilize all the prana he has in his body to
        anticipate Kiritsugu’s next strike. The previous strike was conducted
        using the normal bullet just to entice him to be alert.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If things go according to plan &ndash; Kayneth is digging himself the
        greatest of graves. All that's left is to find the way to shove him in,
        and bury him with Kiritsugu's own hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Magus Killer's "hunt" is about to reach its climax.
