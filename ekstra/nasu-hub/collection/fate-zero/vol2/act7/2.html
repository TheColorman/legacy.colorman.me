      <h2 id="calibre_link-17" class="calibre2">-130:32:40</h2>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The battlefield of the Heroic Spirits had already turned into a swamp
        full of filthy mud.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The horde of alien demonic monsters which appeared endlessly regardless
        of how many were slaughtered; piled into mountains of corpses, the
        spraying innards and bodily fluids mixed, was kicked and stirred by two
        pairs of feet, and formed a chaos even more terrifying than Hell itself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        More rancid that the stench of rot, the smell of the demonic monsters’
        internal organs was thick as mist and filled the air - just like lethal
        poisonous gas. Living humans will probably die from lung corrosion just
        from inhaling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        By now, the number of enemies cut down by Saber and Lancer had long
        surpassed five hundred.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...To make no progress at all for this long, this is a surprise beyond
        amazement."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Lancer had yet to show signs of tiredness, his muttering was
        full of bitterness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The tide of battle cannot be determined. Despite facing the might of two
        knight class Servants, the number of alien demons still didn't decrease,
        being summoned again and again to fill the gaps in the encircling horde.
        "It’s that grimoire, Lancer. As long as his Noble Phantasm is here… this
        situation won’t change."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I see, so that’s what it is."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lancer gave a depressed sigh after he heard Saber’s muttered words.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But, if we want to remove the book from the weakling's hands, we have
        to break through this wall of minions no matter what."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The demonic monsters grouped together and approached them slowly as they
        waved their tentacles mockingly. Perhaps these alien creatures do not
        feel fear of death or pain. As if feeling that happiness only come from
        being slaughtered, they endlessly attacked the two Servants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even now, facing both Saber and Lancer, Caster continues his battle of
        attrition. If this is his strategy, it would obviously promise him
        victory. The amount of prana wielded by Caster and his Noble Phantasm
        might as well be infinite.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...Lancer, at this desperate time, do you want to make a gamble?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although it annoys me to appear outlasted, playing with his minions
        like this will accomplish nothing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Fine. I accept, Saber."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After Lancer's ready consent, Saber stared at the repulsive wall of
        flesh which stretched back to Caster, carefully calculating its
        thickness and density.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is her greatest secret skill - intuition told her this idea is
        'correct', and worth putting all her stakes into. "I'll open the way.
        There is only one chance. Lancer,
        <i class="calibre5">can you run with the wind</i>?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hm? &ndash; Hehe, so that's what it is. Simply done."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite Saber's puzzling words, Lancer nodded with a smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it was only once, they were enemies who fought with their lives
        on the line. Both of them have etched into their memory all the secret
        techniques the other used. Even without an explanation, Lancer could
        understand the skills and intentions of Servant Saber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you quietly mumbling about? Your dying prayers, perhaps?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Caster mocked the two Servants calmly and evenly. Right now it wasn't
        him who was fighting Saber and Lancer, but his Noble Phantasm,
        <span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Text of the Spiralled Sunken Capital" class="calibre9"
            >Prelati's Spellbook</span
          ></span
        >. Caster was like the audience observing the battle from outside the
        ring. For him to elegantly and composedly taunt his opponents and get on
        their nerves is enough to be considered an 'attack'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Feel the terror. Feel the despair! There is a limit to the 'difference
        in numbers' that brute force can overcome. Hahaha, it's humiliating,
        isn't it? To be crushed and suffocated by these ignoble, nameless evils!
        For heroes, there is nothing more humiliating than this!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even awashed by her opponent's joyful scorn, Saber, emotionless and
        unfaltering, merely wielded the sword in her right hand with a decisive
        and calm expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those unwavering eyes were only staring at &ndash; the victory that must
        be obtained. "Haha, that beautiful face... now twist in agony for me,
        Jeanne!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre5">Giiiiiiii!</i>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The horde of demonic monsters roared together. They surged towards the
        center of their ring for the kill as they made alien strange sounds,
        indistinguishable as joy or hatred.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now it would be &ndash; the time to decide who will become the victor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a loud voice, the King of Knights commanded the noble holy sword.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "<span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Hammer of the Wind King" class="calibre9"
            >Strike Air</span
          ></span
        >!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the middle of the whirling air, the resplendent brilliance of gold
        shone through.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sheath of super-high pressured air that protected the holy sword was
        released from the bondage of the invisible barrier &ndash; bellowing
        forth like a savage dragon's roar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The secret sword technique that guaranteed the kill. It is a different
        way to use the Noble Phantasm
        <span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Boundary Field of the Wind King" class="calibre9"
            >Invisible Air</span
          ></span
        >. Last night in the battle against Lancer she released this extreme air
        pressure to accelerate quickly. If it was released towards the enemy it
        would become a tempest, a crushing hammer that blows away entire armies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thoughtlessly packed together, the demonic beasts took the blow all the
        harder. The super-high pressure tempest, compacted like a solid force,
        smashed the demonic monsters to smithereens, mixing the minced flesh
        together with gravel and broken wood. It was as if an invisible giant
        hand swept across the entire earth and opened up a dead straight path.
        The instant they were blown apart by the air pressure, a perfect hole
        appeared in the demonic monsters' ranks. The destructive power of
        <span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Hammer of the Wind King" class="calibre9"
            >Strike Air</span
          ></span
        >
        was countered by the many layers of demonic monsters, reduced to a
        strong gust of wind that merely blew at the ends of Caster’s robe when
        it reached him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The penetrated gap would serve as a path. However, against the density
        of the demonic monsters summoned, it could only count as a temporary
        opening that could be sealed off immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What -&nbsp;?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even so, Caster still made a sound of shock. It wasn't just the blow of
        wind which penetrated the ranks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When objects move extremely quickly in the atmosphere they are capable
        of tearing apart the air in front of them, while leaving a vacuum
        behind. Of course, that vacuum would draw in the surrounding air, and
        become a surge that follows the object which passed through it. There
        are techniques in autoracing that allow cars to follow right behind the
        car in front of it, using that 'slipstream' to accelerate faster.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The air pressure resulting from the release of Saber's
        <span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Boundary Field of the Wind King" class="calibre9"
            >Invisible Air</span
          ></span
        >
        triggered a similar phenomenon. It created a vacuum behind the passing
        gale at the same time it destroyed the army of demonic monsters, and
        prepared a point of in-rushing air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, the one who sprang into this converging surge without hesitation
        was the one who was waiting for this one strike &ndash; Lancer. "Come -
        prepare yourself!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was an ultimate skill that not only demanded superhuman physique, but
        complete synchronization with his partner. However, Lancer achieved this
        miraculous combination with watching his enemy Saber using the secret
        sword of wind for just once.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With one leap Lancer passed through the passage twirling with gales of
        blood and flesh, like a swallow that tucked in its feathered wings by
        its side as it chased the wind. When his feet once again touched earth
        he was barely ten strides away from Caster, with no obstructing barriers
        between them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I have you, Caster!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ahhh!?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The demonic monsters that turned around due to their master's crisis
        stretched their tentacles together towards Lancer's back. But Lancer
        didn't turn back. He brandished the short spear in his left hand behind
        him like a windmill to cut down the pursuing attacks, while he turned
        half his body and approached Caster with the long spear in his right
        hand extended.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was just short of the killing blow. The long spear's strike only
        resulted in the tip cutting slightly into the surface, and didn't make a
        serious tear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But the Noble Phantasm in the enchanting spearman's hand was such a
        weapon that would decide the victor on the battlefield even with such a
        slight touch. "Gouge,
        <span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Crimson Rose of Exorcism" class="calibre9"
            >Gáe Dearg</span
          ></span
        >!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His growl was followed by a crimson stab. The tip of the spear did not
        touch Caster’s fragile body &ndash; but the cover of the grimoire in his
        hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That is the red spearhead which once penetrated Saber’s
        <span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Boundary Field of the Wind King" class="calibre9"
            >Invisible Air</span
          ></span
        >
        and canceled out her magical armor. It is a fatal "Noble Phantasm
        killer", capable of severing all ties of prana. For Caster, who
        completely relied on the mighty power of the grimoire to summon demonic
        monsters to manipulate, it was a decisive blow equal to a checkmate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Boom", a sound akin to waves breaking against rocks beside the sea
        echoed in the forest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The countless alien demonic monsters on the ground all liquefied in the
        blink of an eye. The demonic monsters, which were originally created
        from the flesh and blood of the sacrifices, changed back into blood and
        scattered away. They lost the power to materialize into being the moment
        the prana supply from
        <span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Text of the Spiralled Sunken Capital" class="calibre9"
            >Prelati's Spellbook</span
          ></span
        >
        was terminated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Within the rapidly retreating Caster’s hands, the grimoire immediately
        activated its ability as a prana furnace and quickly regenerated the
        damaged cover. The prana was only cut off during the brief moment when
        <span class="calibre8"
          ><span title="Crimson Rose of Exorcism" class="calibre9"
            >Gáe Dearg</span
          ></span
        >’s blade was in contact with the grimoire; the spear had no power to
        damage the Noble Phantasm itself. However, once canceled, the magecraft
        can’t be salvaged. Even if he wanted to repeat the summoning spell,
        Saber and Lancer’s holy sword and twin spears wouldn’t give him the time
        either.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You bastard- BASTARD bastard BASTARD bastard BASTARD BASTARD
        BASTARDDDDDD!!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Faced with such a desperate situation, Caster’s expression twisted until
        his eyes were rolled to the back of his head and he raged while foaming
        around the mouth. Lancer nonchalantly gave the smile of a rascal that he
        was born with. "How was that? Now that Saber’s taken back her ‘left
        hand’, this is something that can be done with just lifting her little
        finger."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">But Saber wasn’t in the mood to joke like Lancer.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Until the moment victory is decided, the only thing that echoed in her
        mind were the final screams and tears that the children gave out as they
        were torn apart and cruelly slaughtered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"...You had better prepare yourself, heretic."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Knights muttered in a quiet sound of anger as she lifted the
        golden holy sword with her right hand. The sword tip was pointed
        straight towards Caster.
