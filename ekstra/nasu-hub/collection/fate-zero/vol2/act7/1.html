      <p class="calibre3">
        Reminiscing, this is the first time she felt uneasy since Irisviel
        stepped onto the grounds of Fuyuki.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She realizes once again the importance of Saber, who remained by her
        side constantly. The quiet confidence and tolerance emanating from her
        lithe frame gave Irisviel much assurance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was not that Hisau Maiya, Saber’s replacement to accompany her is
        untrustworthy as a guard; Kiritsugu also held Maiya’s abilities in high
        regards, and she is not being suspicious of her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        So what is the reason for this strange anxiousness?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Leaving the castle due to a strategic retreat, there was absolutely no
        dialogue between the two walking in the forest of the bounded field.
        True, Maiya didn’t seem to be the type who enjoyed banter, but her
        complete silence seemed too heavy for Irisviel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Would Maiya answer if she is spoken to first? Trying once probably won’t
        do much harm. Currently, the two are within a safe zone, isolated from
        battle and not in a precarious situation where quietness needed to be
        maintained.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If so, then she is going to gather her courage and open her mouth
        &ndash; but because she didn’t know what to say, Irisviel once again
        checked herself forcefully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The things she wanted to ask were piled as high as mountains. Meeting
        Kiritsugu; memories of time spent with him. Kiritsugu’s integrity in
        Maiya’s eyes… no matter what the question is she wanted to know the
        answer. But Irisviel felt hesitant to ask any one of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hisau Maiya knew the Kirtsugu she did not know.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the answer coming from Maiya’s mouth had enough force to shatter the
        image of her husband in Irisviel’s heart &ndash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No, such a thing is impossible. There is no evidence to deny it in such
        a way. For Irisviel, the short span of nine years since their initial
        meeting was the whole of Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The silence continued as her mind circled about irritably. Though the
        atmosphere was clearly awkward, Maiya continued to move as she ignored
        it completely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Clearly, I am not apt at handling this woman &ndash;”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As she hung her head and sighed deeply, a warning flashed inside
        Irisviel’s head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“--!?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a face full of surprise, Maiya looked at Irisviel, whose whole body
        suddenly stiffened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What’s the matter, madam?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… Another new intruder. Slightly ahead of our position. We’ll meet if
        we continue onward.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The situation was only to be expected. Maiya nodded calmly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Then, let us slowly loop around. It will be very safe if we looped from
        here towards the north.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel, concentrating in her current efforts to scry on the invader
        with the magecraft of ‘clairvoyance’, did not respond immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clad in pitch-black vestments, the tall figure was intimidating. His
        short hair and serious demeanor appears exactly like the photographs
        found in the resources that Kiritsugu collected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… It’s Kirei Kotomine.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to her statement, Irisviel is more surprised by the change in
        Maiya’s expression as she made her report.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Always icy and expressionless, she is a woman whose emotions are
        impossible for anyone to detect. She had thought previously that Maiya’s
        heart must have been truly cold and cruel to her core -
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is the first time Irisviel saw Maiya’s “expression”. It was
        crisscrossed with anxiety and fury. What she saw was completely
        different from fear, but a sense of apprehension. Her fear was probably
        not Kirei, but instead the fact that Kirei appeared in such a situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As she detects this point, Irisviel understood. Though the process was
        brusque, Irisiviel, however, finally understood the mind of Hisau Maiya.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Miss Maiya, the orders you accepted from Kiritsugu is to ensure my
        safety, correct?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Correct, but &ndash;”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But what? You’re thinking “this is the only man whom I cannot allow to
        interfere with Kiritsugu”, right?”　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Smiling slyly, Irisviel pointed out her thoughts. Maiya was temporarily
        rendered speechless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Madam, you… “</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Incidentally, I have the exact same opinion as you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei Kotomine. The man who is probably the greatest threat to
        Kiritsugu. Maiya’s response upon merely hearing his name makes it
        self-evident.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though Irisviel was a homunculus, she fell in love, fulfilled that
        sentiment and even became a mother. Thus, she obtained the sixth sense
        that humans have but homunculi can never understand &ndash; that is, “a
        woman’s intuition.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Let the two of us stop Kirei here. Is that alright, Miss Maiya?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a brief moment of hesitation, Maiya nodded her head with a strange
        expression on her face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “My deepest apologies. But please prepare yourself, madam.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “No problems. Don’t worry about me. You carry out your task. Not the
        orders Kiritsugu gave, but act on the things you think are necessary.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Yes.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Come to think of it, perhaps she had already suspected. That was why she
        was afraid to confirm it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now, Irisviel understood. The reason why she’s been avoiding Maiya… was
        not that she was afraid of her, but she was afraid to know her heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She was afraid of the truth that she “wasn’t the only woman who cares
        about Emiya Kiritsugu”.　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel cannot help but to laugh in the exultation that came with the
        approaching deathmatch. Pulling out her Calico submachine gun, Maiya
        gave her a glance of surprise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; What’s the matter?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“The human heart is truly an amazing thing.”　　</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gambling her life for Kiritsugu &ndash; the fact that there is another
        woman with such determination other than herself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clearly, the answer is supposed to be shocking. However, now &ndash;
        such a truth made her feel infinitely at ease.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre6" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre7">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre6" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Kirei Kotomine, it is not difficult for him to assess Irisviel’s
        side and their plan of action.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All the other Masters are setting Caster as their target, while Caster
        has his eyes set on Saber. Therefore, there was no need for specific
        movements. The best strategy is to make complete preparations to
        confront an attack in the home base and wait for the opponents to
        arrive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, there was no need for a search. The Einsbern Forest in the
        wilderness of Fuyuki &ndash; it should not be unused at this time. Emiya
        Kiritsugu should still be there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, Kirei never planned to enter battle himself. There was a high
        chance of the eastern side of the forest becoming a major battleground.
        It would make sense for their enemies from Fuyuki to attack from that
        direction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, Kirei hung around the western edges, waiting for battle to be
        joined. He also hedged his bets on the chance that &ndash; if battle
        really started on the eastern side as he predicted, then he can launch a
        surprise attack on the castle from its opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He released Assassin into the forest as scouts in spirit form. With the
        ability of “presence concealment”, Assassin is able to enter the bounded
        field without being detected. Though they cannot go near the castle,
        they were still able to observe the battle around the outer rim of the
        forest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And &ndash; as predicted, the battle between Caster and Saber begun on
        the eastern side of the forest. What’s more, and lucky for Kirei,
        Einsbern only engaged with the Servant alone, while the Master remained
        hidden behind closed gates. Assassin’s report was an excellent
        opportunity for Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Kiritsugu was hired by Einsbern to be a hunting dog, then he should
        be guarding the Master who was defenseless and isolated from her
        Servant. Now it’s an excellent chance for Kirei to force them into a
        dead end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though Assassin immediately alerted him to the fact that Lord
        El-Melloi was also advancing towards the castle, Kirei did not hesitate.
        Instead, he felt anxious. If Kiritsugu died by Kayneth’s hand, then it
        would be impossible for Kirei to complete his purpose. Thus, Kirei
        prepared for the worst case scenario of being forced to confront Kayneth
        and advanced rapidly in the forest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Also, depending on situation, there was also a possibility of Einsbern
        abandoning the castle in order to escape. Thus, it is obvious that the
        path of retreat will be the direction away from the eastern battlefield
        where the Servants were currently battling. If that happened, then there
        was a good chance of encountering Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just to be safe, Kirei begin his battle preparations early &ndash; As
        such, he reacted dexterously to the unexpected murderous intent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Within half a breath he ducked and dodged a hailstorm of bullets, which
        howled above his head like thunder. Sometimes, even veterans of many
        battles would lose morale and judgment capabilities when surprised by a
        machine gun. However, such events are mere exceptions to the
        Executioners of the Holy Church. Kirei didn’t even break a sweat as he
        analyzed the situation calmly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There is a single opponent present. Judging from the sound of gunfire,
        it was a submachine gun with a barrel width under 9mm. Because the
        handgun bullets lacked the ability to penetrate tree trunks, its threat
        level was significantly lower than that of the sniper rifle in the
        forest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Inferring the opponent’s position through the location of the gunfire,
        Kirei threw two Black Keys. However, contrary to expected results, he
        only heard the sounds of blades piercing tree trunks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…Mm?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The murderous edge of the kill returned to raid him, flanking the
        surprised Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Once more, the sound of gunfire appeared. This time from his left.
        Though he dodged it at the last second, this volley was considerably
        more dangerous than the volley above. The conclusion he previously
        reached concerning the enemy consisting of only one person slightly
        slowed his reaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The position of the second gunshot was completely different. It was too
        fast for movement. Although, if there were two gunners from the start,
        it was entirely possible to take out Kirei if a coordinated crossfire
        was used.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Amidst his confusion, he sensed again four more presences. Kirei quickly
        placed two black keys in each hand, four black keys in total and
        positioned himself as new sensations flashed in his brain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“That means &ndash; an illusion?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It wasn’t impossible. He was deep into the forest’s bounded field. A
        bounded field includes illusion. In addition, if there was a magus
        present who could control illusions, it was entirely possible to cause
        delusions to the lone target, Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Was the unseen sniper really just a single person? Does this mean the
        one who controlled the illusion was the same? Or does this mean that
        there was someone else responsible for support…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Regardless, before the discovery of a counter to the illusion, he could
        only follow his opponent’s tempo. Kirei pulled out four black keys,
        throwing them simultaneously towards the four directions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        -As anticipated, there was no sign of contact anywhere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei, annoyed at the fruitless endeavor exhibited his frustration. At
        the same time, the bullet scored a direct hit on his back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The third gunshot had even no scent that he could sense. That is to say,
        the first two attacks were designed feints in order to confuse Kirei. In
        theory, if an illusionary trap could control fake hints of murderous
        intents, it should be also possible to seal the true killing intent
        behind it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without even time to howl in pain the tall, robed figure fell face
        first, his feet tangled. There was neither a twitch nor moans of
        pain.　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Has she pierced the spine and killed him instantly? Maiya, deducting as
        such, stood up from her sniping location as she pointed the Calico at
        the prone Kirei and approached him cautiously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“- Miss Maiya, no!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel, sensing a trap, shouted a warning. But it was too late.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei, maintaining his position, did not stand up. Instead, he threw a
        hidden Black Key with a single swing of his arms. From the lower
        trajectory, the black key ripped apart Maiya’s right calf, taking away
        her opportunity for the next action.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like a spring, Kirei mechanically leapt as he suddenly charged toward
        Maiya. Fearlessly, Maiya pressed the trigger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But Kirei only protected his head; he didn’t bother dodging. Even the
        sleeves of the monk’s robes were made from thick Kevlar filaments. It
        was covered seamlessly with the Church’s special protection spells. 9mm
        caliber pistol rounds, even at extremely close distances, cannot pierce
        it. Even then, the strikes from 250 foot-pound bullets, firing at 10
        rounds per second, struck Kirei’s body like metal bats. However, he was
        able to completely protect his organs and bones because of his
        well-trained musculature that acted like armor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sensing that Kirei was bulletproof from head to top, Maiya immediately
        tossed the Calico and pulled out the combat knife located near her
        thigh. Kevlar, though protective against gunshots, was very vulnerable
        to the cutting of a sharp blade. If her gun was useless, she could only
        survive through melee combat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the hailstorm of bullets stopped, Kirei pulled out another pair of
        Black Keys with his hands. He slashed at Maiya with a cross shaped
        movement. Except, Maiya was not slowed in the slightest by her wounded
        right foot, and she deflected the continuous strikes of the Black keys
        with her heavy dagger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though the edge of the Black Key was far longer than the dagger, it
        was still a modified throwing weapon. In close combat the Black Key, due
        to its extreme length, lacked balance; Maiya’s large dagger, due to its
        versatile nature, possessed overwhelming advantage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Victory is still possible ---!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya suddenly charged forward in what seemed to be a half-suicidal
        move. The Black Keys should have a very difficult time defending against
        such an attack, and even if she was struck in retaliation, the chances
        of being seriously wounded were low.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With the Black Key in his right hand, Kirei blocked Maiya’s dagger hand
        for hand. Perhaps he was relying on the length of the blade for a
        counter attack &ndash; the crisscrossed blade’s shadow lunged forward,
        its edge poised to strike.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya, foreseeing the attack, easily dodged the counterattack. Simply
        moving her head a little, the tip of the Black Key missed her as she
        barged into her opponent’s embrace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yet, just when Maiya believed that victory was at hand, her gaze was
        drawn to Kirei’s unusual movements.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The point to a crisscrossing counterattack is that the crossed hands
        &ndash; the right hand, where Kirei should have held the Black Key was
        empty. As he lunged forward, he abandoned his weapon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That is to say, Kirei’s right hand never had the intention of using the
        Black Key to pierce Maiya in the first place -
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like a clamp, the veiny fingers grabbed Maiya’s right hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Snakelike, the tall black-robe twisted his body deftly, and dived
        beneath Maiya’s right arm. In the next instant, as if supporting someone
        who is wounded, Kirei carried Maiya’s right arm with the back of his
        shoulder.

        The exorcist who wielded the Black Keys &ndash; she was fooled by her
        prejudiced first impression. In deadly despair, the helpless Maiya
        finally understood. This movement is Chinese kungfu,

            >Baji Quan</a

        >. At the same time Kirei’s side pressed close to Maiya’s waist. Using
        his left elbow to land a blow at Maiya’s heart as simultaneously, a
        brilliant strike from his left foot struck Maiya’s supporting leg.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An amazing completion of “Six grand opening &ndash; elbow upthrust.” As
        he grabbed the hand holding the dagger, all the actions are completed in
        an instant. A combo worthy of the soul of Ba ji quan &ndash; combining
        offense and defense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya could not even move as she fell heavily to the ground. Due to the
        extreme level of impact, the paralyzed Maiya thought she had dislocated
        both her arms and legs. Subconsciously, she could only feel the sharp
        pain in her chest after it had been struck by the elbow. She probably
        had broken two, or three ribs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though a single strike was capable of disabling Maiya. Kirei,
        however, was satisfied. Since now he knew Kiritsugu’s location, Kirei
        did not need to grant her any mercy. As he clenched his fist &ndash;
        ready to deliver the death-blow &ndash; at that time, he saw something
        that made him doubt his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The embarrassed Maiya was also surprised. It was already agreed upon,
        that prior to battling Kirei, Irisviel will only be supporting her from
        a hidden location. But she &ndash; Irisviel, who, except for magic,
        should have no other type of self-defense gently floated from the bushes
        and stood facing Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Madam, no!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now, Maiya tossed away all her fears and embarrassment. To her, compared
        to her own danger, more serious question was the threat now to Irisviel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Kiritsugu were to lose his wife now &ndash; as someone who swore to
        protect him, there can be no danger that’s more despairing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">To Kirei, this situation was hard to comprehend.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He knew that Irisiviel and her family were not apt at using combat magic
        due to their specialization in alchemy. During the previous three
        Heaven’s Feels, they were helplessly defeated during the first rounds.
        Perhaps, that was also the reason for these northern magi being nearly
        useless in actual combat. Judging from the fact that they found the
        mercenary Kiritsugu, they must have reflected upon the issue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, in the situation where the female protector lay fallen on the
        ground, isn’t this most unlikely situation - the fact that the Einzbern
        family’s Master appearing alone in front of Kirei?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei was fairly certain that the silver-haired maiden in front of him
        was Saber’s master. If she dies, then the Einzbern camp will undoubtedly
        be defeated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This woman should be the key piece that must escape no matter what the
        cost is.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Woman, you may be surprised, but my reason for coming here is not to
        defeat you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the enemy Master, the statement is equivalent to abandoning
        battle. Even though it is unlikely that his opponent will believe him,
        at least Kirei made the attempt to negotiate. This new developing was
        too far from what he had hoped for &ndash; meeting with Kiritsugu on the
        battlefield was his real goal. Compared to that goal, the situation of
        the Heaven’s Feel can only play second fiddle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, he didn’t expect his opponents to believe his words -
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I understand, Kirei Kotomine.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        -Because he did not anticipate the belief of the opposition. The
        silver-haired maiden’s reply only made Kirei more confused.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I know why you’re here. Although, this is not negotiable. You cannot
        reach Kiritsugu…We will stop you. Here.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To Irisviel, it was a good thing that the exorcist looked confused. The
        opponent clearly underestimated her, and his carelessness was her chance
        at victory. Perhaps, he knew the specialty behind Einzbern’s magic, and
        figured out that she was not a combat magician.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel pulled out the “secret weapon” hidden in her large sleeves. At
        first glance, it was no magic, but rather an unreliable item. A soft and
        thin metallic bouquet of wires dangled lightly between her fingers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Madam, this man is an executor &ndash; an expert magus hunter! This is
        not an opponent that can be faced with only magic!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya, suppressing her pain, screamed on the ground. In response,
        Irisviel only smiled quietly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What I learned from Kiritsugu, isn't limited to operating a car!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Maiya watched speechlessly and Kirei observed in surprise, Irisviel
        poured mana into the metallic threads. The thin threads became unraveled
        and moved between Irisviel hands like a living organism.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei’s understanding was half correct. The Einzbern family possessed
        magic that was designed to forge, create, and more importantly, use
        matter. Kiritsugu could not have taught her any offensive magic.
        Originally, if one went solely by magical ability, Irisviel was far
        superior to her husband. Thus, Kiritsugu could not have taught her
        magic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What he taught her was not how the homunculus lived. Rather, it was to
        use tears, laughter, joy and anger to sing about life &ndash; the
        meaning of the term “to live.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, he also taught her the determining to “live on.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei’s understanding was also half-wrong. Irisviel already had a method
        of turning her magic into offensive purposes as a “battle” state. It was
        something she learned from her husband, who always lived for battle
        &ndash; if she was to “live on” with him, she must face the test of
        “survival” one day. Thus, she will also need to face battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Shape ist Leben!” (From German: "Shape is life!") [Furigana
        translation: "Shape, conceive life!"]
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Through two small chants, weaving the magic in one breath. The control
        of metallic shapes was Irisiviel’s true skill.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This secret was peerless.</p>

        The silvery thread crisscrossed as it drew into complex shapes. It
        crisscrossed, combined, like a weaved piece of art as it took on a
        complex solid shape. Possessing fierce wings and beaks, and sharp claws.
        Using a giant eagle as base, it appeared as an intricate silvery work of
        art.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">No, wait, this was not a mere framework-</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Kyeeeee!!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like the sound of a metallic blade scratching, the eagle made out of
        silver threads screeched and flew from Irisviel's hands. It was created
        by an alchemy-using homunculus on the spot. It was a “weapon” given life
        by Irisviel, whose fate hangs in the balance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The bullet-like flight far surpassed Kirei’s imagination. Surprised, he
        dodged the attack, but the razor-sharp beak still brushed past his nose.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the first strike missed, the silver thread eagle started to circle
        above Kirei’s head. This time, both claws dashed downward. The target
        was Kirei’s face. Although, for an executor, this battle was not simply
        defensive. Fearless of the sharpness of those claws, he struck at the
        eagle with a powerful strike from his fist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sharply descending eagle could not change its flight path. The fist
        landed a clear blow on the abdomen of the eagle. 　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Mm!?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yet, Kirei was the one who was surprised. As the eagle was struck by his
        fist, it changed into shapeless silver thread and wrapped around his
        right fist like vines. 　　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immediately, he pulled with his left hand, but the silver thread also
        trapped the other one. Only moments ago, the silver thread flew with an
        eagle’s shape in the air, but now, like handcuffs, it tightly trapped
        Kirei’s hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“….Hm.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yet, as an executor, Kirei has fought countless magi to the death. Only
        grunting lightly, he charged towards Irisviel. It didn’t matter if his
        hands were trapped &ndash; as long as he delivered a kick up close, the
        battle would be decided.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Too naïve!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel scolded as she poured more mana into the silver threads.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not even Kirei can hold out this time. As he lost his balance, the
        silver threads wrapped around the tree tightly and pulled Kirei towards
        it. Finally, it bound him firmly towards the tree trunk
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The grown tree was more than 30 cm thick. Even if Kirei wanted to use
        his outrageous strength, it was impossible for him to break or uproot
        the tree. At last, he was completely immobile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And even then, Irisviel was the one who steadily lost her advantage
        underneath Kirei’s strength. In theory, Kirei’s hands should have been
        overpowered by the pressure generated by the silver thread. Yet, his
        muscles were trained to the point where they appeared steel-like, and
        they were powerful beyond all belief. Her silvery thread almost broke,
        as they struggled underneath the saturated state of near-collapse. In
        order to keep it tight and to prevent the metal from breaking, she must
        constantly use her mana to maintain it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…Maiya-san….hurry!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The key to victory &ndash; was the still-prone Maiya. She was the only
        one who could give Kirei a final blow. As long as she stayed out of the
        range of his kicks, a simple shot to the exposed head was enough. For
        Kirei, it was impossible for him to cover his head with his sleeves like
        before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As she received a momentary respite, the injured Maiya recovered
        sensation in her hands and feet. Moaning in pain from her broken ribs,
        she moved slowly to the abandoned Calico.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Victory or defeat is a battle of willpower measured by seconds &ndash;
        even though she clenched her teeth in pain from the magical backlash,
        Irisviel still encouraged herself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya picking up the gun to fire; as long as she can keep the thread’s
        strength to that point, it would be good. Then, they could eliminate
        Kirei Kotomine, the greatest threat to Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It could be said that the two women still mistakenly underestimated the
        terror that is the Executor of the Church.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With no knowledge of Chinese kungfu, Irisviel thought that it was only
        necessary to bind Kirei’s hands to render him helpless. It was not her
        fault that she only thought like that. However, for someone who managed
        to reach the level of training such as Kirei, the entire body is a
        weapon. For example, if he only planted both feet on the ground…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “BOOM,” the deafening sound rendered Irisviel speechless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The tree trunk shook erratically. As if struck by a full-powered fist.
        That means the sound she was hearing &ndash; only someone using his full
        strength to strike at the center of the tree could make that sort of
        sound.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The clear strike sounded again. This time, she started to doubt her
        ears. She heard a chilling sound of breakage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She could not see the situation, but Irisviel understood through the
        touch of her silver thread. The tree trunk that bound Kirei had large
        cracks in it. The cracks were next to the part where the silver thread
        wrapped around &ndash; the spot directly below Kirei’s hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei, with the back of his hands pressing against the bark, was
        striking at the tree trunk with all of his strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel could not have known &ndash; but the strength from a martial
        arts master is not merely produced from the wrist. From the strength of
        the feet on the ground, the turning of the back, and the twisting of
        shoulders, it was possible to instantaneously release a burst of power
        in the fists. To an expert in this phenomenon, the strength of the arm
        was insignificant in comparison to the power of the whole body. If it
        was necessary, one can press the fist next to the target and strike
        simply by virtue of the “force” coming from outside of the arm &ndash;
        this is known as the hidden technique of “explosive force.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sound of the third strike shook the forest. In comparison to the
        time before, this was much stronger. The tree trunk groaned one last
        time as the broken fibers broke with loud cracks. As the supporting
        point of the silvery thread, the trunk collapsed. Grabbing the thread
        with both of his hands, Kirei nonchalantly escaped the silvery ring at
        the point of collapse and pulled the thread apart link by link.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel knelt instantly as she felt the powerful backlash from the
        breaking of her magic. Calmly stepping forward in the manner of a
        victorious conqueror, Kirei looked into the despairing eyes of the two
        women and strode to the Calico, easily crushing its wooden frame with
        his hammerlike feet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Bastard......”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Still not being able to stand back up, prostrate, Maiya moaned
        viciously. After throwing at her an extremely bored glance, with the tip
        of his foot, Kirei casually kicked her at the stomach. As if sobbing
        convulsively, after Maiya fainted in agony and rolled over, she was
        perfectly still this time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And then, with a look that lacked any expression, this time his gaze was
        laid on Irisviel.
