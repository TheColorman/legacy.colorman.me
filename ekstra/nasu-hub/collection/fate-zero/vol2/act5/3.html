      <p class="calibre3">
        After a night of continuous deadly fights, a streak of white light
        gradually appeared at the eastern sky. At this moment Kirei was using
        the magical communicator to establish a connection with the Tōsaka
        mansion in the Miyami district. He and his father Kotomine Risei were
        preparing to call for an emergency strategy meeting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Huh? Can we really trace Caster’s trail immediately now?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi’s satisfaction and praise were revealed through his voice. Kirei
        and Assassin’s efforts had finally yielded the results he wanted.
        Although his servant was still a tricky problem, his apprentice’s side
        had progressed very smoothly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Our opponent is really the Heroic Spirit of a magus. Despite being an
        Assassin, it was still tough for him to enter their workshop unnoticed.
        But now we are sure of the approximate position of the enemy. Currently
        Assassin is carrying out close surveillance at the perimeter of the
        area. Once Caster appears out of his workshop, his activities can be
        known immediately.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Which is to say that Caster did not stay within his workshop, and is
        actively operating outside?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Yes. That’s because……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Recalling Tokiomi’s reaction when he delivered the report last time,
        Kirei hesitated slightly. Caster and his master’s actions might give
        rise to grave consequences.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…Both of them went to the city beside Miyami town and captured the
        sleeping children back to their workshop. Until daylight appears, they
        had caught 15 of them. Though most operations were carried out smoothly,
        the parents of 3 children discovered them and a struggle ensued.
        Eventually, the two killed the entire family.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Able to clearly feel Tokiomi’s fury, Kirei continued promptly before he
        manages to reply.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Caster uses magecraft unhesitatingly, and he does not even clean and
        tidy up the place after it. Now, under my father’s instructions, workers
        from the Holy Church are clearing the traces they left behind at the
        scene. However……I’m afraid that even after today, Caster and his
        Master’s behavior will not change in any way.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……What on earth are they thinking! What type of person is that jerk?
        The Master of that Caster.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “According to Assassin who eavesdropped their conversations, before
        summoning Caster, that Master had already been carrying out similar
        murders like this. Though we can’t be sure yet, this guy is apparently
        the same person as the wanted serial killer.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…………”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tokiomi breathed heavily in anger.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since this month, news of the mysterious serial killer- ‘The Demon of
        Fuyuki City’, had been continuously reported. Using brutal methods
        rarely seen within these few years, he was related to 4 murder incidents
        in the city. Worst still, in the last case, it was said that he had
        killed all the family members in their sleep - an extremely savage
        killer. The police of Fuyuki city had set up a special task force which
        had gathered the police force from the neighboring vicinity to crack the
        case quickly. Nevertheless, there had been no progress at all; they were
        still at the stage where they cannot even determine the facial features
        of the suspect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Tokiomi, for such a serious thing to happen during Heaven’s Feel was
        indeed a headache. This should be the same for all Masters. The Heaven’s
        Feel must be carried out in secret. This is a solemn rule for all
        contestants. Someone who drew so much attention to this place would not
        be welcomed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Actually, all the magi were responsible to guard the noble creed.
        Whoever he is, nobody would expose magecraft to the common people.
        Everyone researched their magecraft underground; those who failed to
        guard this secret would be put to death promptly by the Association. As
        long as something is related to the secrecy of magecraft, the Magus
        Association was firm and thorough in managing it. That is why this
        matter always made the magi’s blood run cold.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Let say there was a magus who appear at the headlines of the community
        news almost daily; and that this Master is his Servant’s puppet- this
        had to be a critically alarming situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “About these two, did you obtain any detailed information, reports, or
        something like that?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “From how they call each other, we can gather that the Master’s name is
        ‘Ryuunosuke’, while Caster is known as ‘Bluebeard’.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Bluebeard? Then Caster’s real identity has to be Count Gilles de Rais,
        isn’t it?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Possible. This person was very famous in alchemy and black magic."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the point of view of his fame as a legend, it is not surprising
        that he is summoned by the Holy Grail as a Servant. It's just that his
        characteristics are totally different from a Heroic Spirit. It is more
        fitting for him to be known as ‘vengeful spirit’ instead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “From their conversations, as a Master, Ryuunosuke does not have any
        prior knowledge about Heaven’s Feel. Putting that aside, he doesn’t even
        have the self-consciousness of a magus.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This is quite possible. Under accidental situations, it is possible for
        someone without any magecraft teaching to make a contract with the
        summoned Servant… That Master will be the Servant’s puppet.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“But, that is...”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Recalling what he had heard through Assassin’s ears, Kirei continued:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…No matter what, Caster’s words and actions are beyond the boundary of
        normal comprehensions. He keeps saying things like the Holy Grail is
        already his; must rescue Jeanne d’Arc - things that do not make sense at
        all.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if trying to vent out all the anger in his heart in a single breath,
        Tokiomi let out a deep sigh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “A Servant that is rampaging around due to his mental disturbance and a
        Master who is totally helpless at the situation? Why on earth did the
        Holy Grail choose such jerks?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Servants attacking human beings- this itself is nothing abnormal. For
        spiritual beings who feed on prana to exist, Servants do not just
        acquire prana restoration from their Masters. They can also procure
        energy by absorbing the spirit of human beings. Masters who are
        incapable of providing sufficient prana to their Servants may use
        sacrificial ceremonies to make up for the inadequate prana.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even in this Heaven’s Feel, cases like offering sacrifices were still
        within Tokiomi’s expectations. This is something without blame. Magi
        themselves are already existences beyond common rules. They can ignore
        morality and usual preception of right and wrong. If they have to
        sacrifice innocent people, as long as it is covertly and secretly done,
        silent approval is given.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But reckless murders like this which create such a huge commotion - this
        behavior is never allowed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You cannot let this matter run wild, right? Tokiomi-kun.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">With a displeased look, Father Risei cut in.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Caster and his Master’s actions have clearly obstructed the progress of
        the Heaven’s Feel. This is against the rules.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Of course. As someone whose former job was to guard the secrecy of
        magecraft, I will not let them off.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For generations, the Tōsaka family had always been the secret guardian
        of the area of Fuyuki city. Managing the laylines of this land and
        monitoring any abnormal occurrence here - this is the responsibility
        entrusted to them by the Magus Association. This is also the reason, as
        one of the ‘three initiate families’, the Tōsakas offered this place
        under their watch as the stage for the Heaven’s Feel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As a Master whose goal is to acquire the Holy Grail and also as the
        guardian of this land, Tokiomi really has to stop Caster’s actions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I’m afraid they are also behind the continual disappearances of the
        children after the 4 murder cases.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kirei reported his views dryly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “There only 17 children reported missing. If we take the situation of
        this morning’s surveillance into account, and if we include the extra
        ones they captured, the number of missing children will be at least 30.
        Their actions will only intensify, I’m afraid. Father, we have to stop
        them as soon as possible.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Yeah. It is already beyond the extent where warnings and punishments
        are effective. The only way left is to destroy Caster and his Master.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But the problem is that to fight a Servant, we have to rely on a fellow
        Servant. However, my Assassin cannot take any action.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei’s remarks really made sense. Assassin’s purpose was to
        specifically carry out clandestine plans, and how can he be allowed to
        show up again so quickly?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Father Risei contemplated this in silence for a while. To Tokiomi, he
        suggested:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It is within my jurisdiction as a supervisor to alter the rules
        slightly. What if we put the struggle for the Holy Grail aside first? We
        muster all the other Masters to go against Caster. How about it?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Huh? Then……what do you have in mind, Father?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I can provide certain help which would assist the one who manage to
        eradicate Caster’s Master, in their future battles. The result of having
        the entire Heaven’s Feel disrupted because of Caster’s sole rampage… I
        doubt the other Masters would want it to happen too.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……Oh I see. Change the objective of this game to hunting. Is that
        right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Taking the Servant whose hand was injured in yesterday night’s haphazard
        fight into consideration, none of the Servants were killed yet. So if
        everyone shifts their targets to Caster, his life would be hanging by a
        thread. Just like a lighted candle in a hurricane, Caster's fate is
        ready to be extinguished any moment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But the condition of awarding benefits to the one who defeats
        Caster……Will it backfire on us instead? Will it eventually hinder us
        from obtaining the Holy Grail?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Smiling, Father Risei replied.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Of course it is not good for someone else to acquire the benefits. But
        the only one who could deliver the final blow to Caster, cornered by the
        hounds, would be Archer.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……I see. That’s obvious.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As long as Kirei’s Assassin is present, it will be all too easy to
        arrange the time accurately so that Archer delivers the finishing blow.
        Although the rules were altered now, the Tōsaka camp’s battle tactics
        and skills were still unchanged.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Then quickly prepare to gather the other Masters.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After he decided what to do, Father Risei got up and left the
        underground chamber. Just as Kirei was about to stand up, he was halted
        by Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…Oh yes, Kirei-kun. I heard that you left the Fuyuki Church to do
        something on your own yesterday night.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei had already anticipated Tokiomi’s question. On the surface,
        Tokiomi’s apprentice had already been defeated in this Heaven’s Feel,
        and was currently seeking protection from the church. So he shouldn't be
        doing anything at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I am very sorry. I know this is very risky too, but I had discovered a
        spy in the vicinity of the church. So I had to do something about it-”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Spy? Is its target you, who’s a part of the Church?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tokiomi sounded much stricter.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Please don’t worry about it. I have already destroyed the spy. No
        secret will be leaked out,” answered Kirei in a breezy voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei surprised even himself at his ease in lying straight at his
        Master’s face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Why didn’t you use your Servant?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I feel that this is something trivial. Assassin is not required.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a moment of silence, Tokiomi commented, slightly unhappily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……You really are a highly-skilled Executor, and I also know you have
        high confidence in your ability. But based on the current situation,
        aren’t you careless in these actions of yours?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“You’re right. I’ll tread carefully next time.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kirei lied again.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From now onwards, Kirei would probably go into the battlefield a few
        more times to trace Emiya Kiritsugu’s trail, until he finds him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei waited until the communicator was in complete silence before
        leaving the underground chamber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as Kirei opened the door of his room in the first floor of the
        house, he sensed a disharmony as if he had just walked into a wrong
        room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was neither the change of scent nor the change in temperature of the
        room. Overall, he felt a great change in the overall feel of the room.
        The plain room of his had suddenly emanated a luxurious and elegant
        feeling as if it is a palace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was no difference in the settings and lightings of the room. The
        only difference was a man who is sitting on the bench in the middle of
        the room, totally ignorant of everyone else.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This intruder, who took over someone else’s room with no reason, is
        someone that surprised Kirei a little. Startled, Kirei frowned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……Archer?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With golden hair standing upright as if it’s burning and a pair of
        ruby-red eyes, this man in front of him was none other than Tōsaka
        Tokiomi’s Servant, the King of Heroes, Gilgamesh. However, instead of
        wearing his original golden armor, this Heroic Spirit was donned in a
        modern match-up of a leather jacket with furs and fashionable leather
        pants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since he was summoned, this Servant had been wondering around carelessly
        with his ability of Independent Action. But, getting tired of parading
        himself in his spirit form, Archer decided to dress himself in ‘playing
        attire’ to take on physical form on a whim while having a stroll in the
        streets at night. Although he had heard of Archer’s idiotic deeds from
        Tokiomi, Kirei had never imagined that Archer would appear in his room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Apparently, Archer was not ashamed at all at intruding other people’s
        rooms. Putting that aside, he had even casually removed a bottle of red
        wine from the cupboard and had poured himself a cup. Elegantly, Archer
        sipped the wine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Despite being few in number, compared to Tokiomi’s collection, yours is
        more high-class. What a presumptuous apprentice.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…………”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Still in the dark about the reason for Archer’s visit, Kirei looked at
        the row of empty wine bottles on the table.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looks like Archer had tasted all Kirei’s hidden wine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it is initially surprising, if one ponders about it, he would
        find nothing strange. Kirei has this habit that, once he hears of a wine
        of extraordinary quality, he would purchase it immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The study of wine is actually a deep world without any boundaries if you
        wish to pursue it. Wine can fill the emptiness of one’s heart through
        its taste. When you are feeling hollow inside, getting drunk with
        alcohol is not a bad idea too.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Walking in the cul-de-sac, Kirei thought about these ideas,
        half-seriously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nevertheless, hitherto, he had never tried wine even once. All he did
        was to increase to number of delicious wines. Kirei did not even think
        of serving it to his guests.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for this drunkard who casually drinks others’ hidden wine, no matter
        how much he praised it, Kirei did not have any welcoming attitude
        towards him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What do you want?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing this blunt question, Archer lifted up his wine glass and gazed
        meaningfully at Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Looks like the ones who are bored aren’t just limited to me alone.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Bored?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this reply, Kirei realized the meaning behind those words
        instantly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Apparently, this heroic spirit had known what transpired last night-
        Kirei disobeying Tokiomi’s orders to stay put, and venturing out alone-
        although Kirei was not sure since when Archer knew about it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What’s wrong, Kirei? Are you also feeling unsatisfied with only obeying
        Tokiomi’s commands?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……So, are you still unhappy with your contract now, Gilgamesh?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Evading Archer’s question, Kirei asked back in a displeased tone.
        Although he is the mystical ‘King of Heroes’, Kirei did not see him as
        someone to be feared. In spite of Tokiomi’s views, a Servant is still a
        servant. No matter who this Heroic Spirit is, he is still Servant
        Archer, an existence belonging to Tokiomi. Comparing him to Kirei who is
        Tokiomi’s apprentice, their status is about the same. There is no need
        to worry too much about him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer did not mind this attitude of his. He merely snorted, and took
        another sip of wine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The one who summoned me here and has been providing me with prana is
        Tokiomi. So no matter what, I still have to treat him with servant-like
        etiquette.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After this surprising declaration, a sliver of melancholic haze gleamed
        in Gilgamesh’s red irises.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But frankly speaking, he is really a boring man, completely devoid of
        any interesting aspects.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……These words should not come from you, a Servant.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From his astonished heart, Kirei felt a slight surge of anger at
        Archer’s rude remark towards his master. At the same time, he felt that
        he had a rough idea as to why Archer came to visit him. In this mored
        relaxed atmosphere, Kirei had slowly accepted the presence of Archer in
        his room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Are they really that mundane? Tokiomi-shi’s orders.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Huh… Really meaningless. Wanting to achieve the omnipotent,
        wish-granting device, ‘Akasha’? What a pointless wish.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only thing every magus yearns for even in their dreams; Archer
        laughed it off just like that. But Kirei was able to empathize with him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The craving desire for the ‘root’ is something every magus has.
        Bystanders would not be able to comprehend it.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If that is so, you are one of the bystanders too, Kirei. As far as I
        know, before this, your position is one which opposes the magi, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer had seemingly heard about Kirei’s complicated stand. Although he
        always wears an air of hauteur, his ability to gather information is
        amazingly sharp.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei folded his arms, deep in thought. Instead of Tōsaka Tokiomi’s
        apprentice, if he looks at things from the view point of the
        representative of the Assembly of the 8th Sacrament, what is the purpose
        of Tokiomi’s Heaven’s Feel?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…..The path leading to the ‘root’ can be said to lead to the ‘outside’
        of the world. Which is to say, it will not bring any effect to the
        ‘inside’, which is this world. For the Church, which only focuses on the
        ‘inside’, the magi’s pursuit is downright pointless. We can only take
        their action as a meaningless plan.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Oh I see. Looks like I am only interested in things related to this
        universe, which is also my garden.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Speaking as if he owns the universe…Having such a haughty attitude
        really fits his status as the ‘King of Heroes’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I am not interested in the territories that cannot be controlled by me.
        That’s why I don’t care about this ‘root’ thingy at all.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei smiled bitterly. In other words, this Archer’s stand goes against
        all the other magi. That is why it is reasonable for Tōsaka Tokiomi, a
        typical magus, to feel helpless at someone like Archer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If the Holy Grail of Fuyuki City is only a special device which seeks
        the ‘root’, no matter how violently the magi fight for it, I think the
        Holy Church would just ignore them. Unfortunately, the ability for the
        Holy Grail to realize wishes is ‘omnipotent’. It has unlimited,
        mysterious power to change even the ‘inside’ of the world. If such a
        great power were to fall into wrong hands, it will become an existence
        which threatens our belief. This is the reason the Holy Church chose
        Tōsaka. Instead of ignoring this matter and let the grail fall into
        wrong hands, it is better if it is wasted on a ‘boring, meaningless
        wish’…… But I have a feeling that my father has other purposes in the
        beginning.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What you mean is, the other Masters fight for the Holy Grail for
        reasons different from Tokiomi’s?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei nodded his head in response to Archer’s query.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “While Tokiomi is a typical representation of a magus, he is also one of
        the most right-winged. In this era, people who pursue pure magecraft
        like he does no longer exist. All the other guys are pursuing the gifts
        of mundane riches. Prestige, desires, power… all these are wishes that
        can be fulfilled ‘within’ the world.” “Isn’t this great? These are all
        my favorite things.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You are but the king who reigned over these uncouth ones, Gilgamesh.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Refusing to reply, Archer merely laughed and finished his delicious wine
        in a single gulp. At Kirei’s apparent evaluation, he did not feel
        insulted at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Then what about you? Kirei, what wish do you want to fulfill by getting
        your hands on the Holy Grail?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At such a direct question, for the first time, Kirei hesitated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Indeed. This is the most fundamental question of all. Why are the
        Command Seals engraved on Kotomine Kirei’s left hands?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I……do not have any special wish.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At his vague reply, Archer’s red pupils emanated a coquettish glow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “How can that be possible? I thought the Holy Grail only summons those
        with wishes?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It should be like that. But……I am not sure of the reason too. Why would
        the Holy Grail choose me? Someone without any ideals to accomplish;
        someone without any cravings to fulfill… Why am I chosen?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Is this something worth such frustration?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Noticing his heavy look, Archer could not help but to laugh loudly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If it is not for any desire or ideal, won’t merely seeking pleasure be
        enough?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“How dare you!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kirei’s fury is basically created unconsciously.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You want me, a disciple of God, to seek pleasures? ...How can I commit
        such a sinful act which would cause me to be condemned?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Sinful act? Condemned?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the serious expression of Kirei's, Archer felt more meaning
        to those words. Without bearing any goodwill, Archer laughed at him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Huh. That was a leap in logic, Kirei. Why did you correlate pleasure
        and sin?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“That’s because……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei could not reply. And Kirei was also unsure how he ended up in such
        an awkward situation, something he had never experienced before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Kirei’s silence, Archer became increasingly full of himself and
        commented.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Acquiring pleasures through sins is actually wrong. But humans do
        acquire happiness through virtuous means. If you say that pleasure in
        itself is sinful, does it make sense at all?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Such an elementary question, yet why was he struggling to reply? The
        reason eluded Kirei. He felt as if a nonchalant unease was locked in an
        unknown territory deep within his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……What pleasures? I do not even have them. That’s why I will not seek
        it.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finally opening his mouth, Kirei answered in a voice unlike him at all,
        unsure and hesitating- as if he could not find the answer and simply
        came up with some sentence to deal with it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer scrutinized him, then burst out in laughter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Kotomine Kirei, suddenly I have a new-found interest in you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……What do you mean?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I’m just kidding. Don’t mind me.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Pouring himself a new cup of red wine, he leaned back on the sofa,
        speaking loudly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Happiness is fundamentally a part of the human soul. There isn’t any
        ‘yes’ and ‘no’ distinction. It is just whether you are ‘aware’ or ‘not
        aware’ of it. Kirei, you had only failed to find it from the depths of
        your heart. To experience happiness, that is the first thing to do.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Mind you own business, Servant. Trying to educate me…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This is no ordinary education. It is gained by a king from experiencing
        all the luxuries and pleasures of the world. Listen carefully.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite saying that, Kirei was actually meticulously analyzing
        everything Archer said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For some reasons, those haughty words sent shockwaves to his nerves.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Kirei. First of all, you have to understand something about this thing
        called entertainment.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Entertainment?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “U-huh. Limiting your views to only the ‘inside’ is not the right way.
        You must broaden your horizon……Oh yeah. Let’s start by letting you
        experience my entertainments. How does that sound?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “For the ‘me’ right now, there is no such thing as ‘time for
        entertainment’.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">I am different from you, Kirei thought silently.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hey, don’t say something like that. After accomplishing Tokiomi’s
        tasks, you will have lots of time, eh? You duty is to dispatch spies to
        monitor the movements of the other five Masters, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……You are correct.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “In that case, you shouldn’t just understand their intentions and battle
        strategies. How about finding out their reasons for seeking the Holy
        Grail and letting me know about them? That’s not something too hard for
        you, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Indeed, this type of investigation did not diverge much from the
        assignment Tokiomi gave him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Assassin, who observed the everyday life of its target, could easily
        record their conversations. By analyzing the content of the dialogues,
        the reason they sought the Holy Grail could then be deduced easily. All
        he had to do is just to ask Assassin to pay extra attention to this type
        of conversation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……But Archer, why do you want to know such things?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I mentioned it before, right? I am interested in the behaviors of human
        beings. And among those who fight for the Holy Grail, there has to be
        one or two interesting Masters, right? At least more interesting than
        Tokiomi.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei tried to cool his head and think rationally. He had only regarded
        Emiya Kiritsugu with interest, completely ignoring the rest. Besides, he
        did not have any obligation to agree to Archer’s request. However, if he
        could have some influence over this Servant who was completely out of
        Tokiomi’s control, maybe it would bring some positive effects to the
        Tokiomi camp in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……Okay, Archer. I promise you. But this will take some time.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“No problem at all. I have the patience to wait.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After finishing the red wine again, Archer rose from the couch. His
        movements caused not only the air to waver slightly; the glow within the
        room fluctuated with him as well. This Heroic Spirit who controlled all
        the creations of the earth seemed to emanate an invisible radiance from
        his entire body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah, I will come again to taste your delicious wine. You collection can
        even rival the heavenly wines. To leave them gathering dust in a monk’s
        storeroom is such a waste.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Expressionless, Kirei neither agreed nor disagreed. Maybe Archer took
        his silence as consent. Wearing a satisfied smile, he left the room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right after Archer left, the majestic atmosphere left the room too;
        replacing it, the mundane atmosphere of the room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finally alone, Kirei started to ponder on the strange conversation he
        had with the strange visitor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was the first time he had a one-to-one conversation with Archer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Come to think of it, be it Servants or Masters, all of them fight with
        all they have in this Heaven’s Feel to fulfill certain wishes- save that
        uncontrollable King of Heroes who is apparently not interested in the
        Holy Grail at all. Amongst the Servants gathered in Fuyuki city, he had
        to be the one with the least will to fight. From this point of view, it
        looks like he shared the same sentiment with Kirei - he had to be the
        only Master who participated in the Heaven’s Feel without any reason.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No, maybe the reason still existed, just that Kirei hadn’t discovered it
        yet. There had to be a craving desire for the Holy Grail to achieve
        certain miracles, maybe somewhere deep within his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nevertheless, this is definitely not the ‘happiness’ Archer talked
        about.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The one who knows the answer is not Archer; it is someone else.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The person in question is Emiya Kiritsugu. Everything would have been
        solved if the conversation just now could instead be between him and
        Emiya Kiritsugu, Kirei thought.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course their positions were completely different. Thus they would
        have discussed using their weapons instead of their words. But it is
        still alright if that is the case, since Kirei had only wanted to fight
        with this person called Emiya Kiritsugu; a conversation between men.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As these thoughts played in his mind, Kirei picked up the empty wine
        bottles tossed away by Archer.
      </p>
