      <p class="calibre3">
        At the scene of the collapsed Fuyuki Hyatt hotel, the rescue team was
        working frantically throughout the night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the effect of Kiritsugu’s magecraft was lost, the evacuation
        personnels discovered that there were still two VIPs in the building
        when it collapsed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because they were on the top floor of the hotel when the incident
        happened, rescue workers lost all hopes at finding them alive. Still,
        their bodies had to be found before they threw in the towel completely.
        Under the daylight-bright mobilite, rescue workers quickly cleared the
        rubbles at the scene using excavators.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the dawn of the following day, the rescue team that toiled throughout
        the night was exhausted. At this moment, something strange happened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“You said you found something strange?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was followed by the prompt arrival of the chief of the rescue team
        to the scene. According to the workers, they found a silver sphere of
        about 3 meters in diameter amongst the rubble. No matter how they
        examine it, it did not look like part of the building materials at all.
        Out of nowhere, it had just appeared suddenly in the midst of the
        rubbles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……Is this from the building? One of the decorations of the revolving
        restaurant on the top floor?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Even if that is the case, this thing is perfectly undamaged. Isn’t that
        weird?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At closer observation, its surface did indeed have no signs of damage at
        all. Reflecting bright light just like a mirror, it looks like it had
        just been polished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Why…does it look like mercury?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The bewildered chief declared his thoughts as he laid his hands on the
        surface of the sphere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the first contact, surprisingly the sphere sank inwards.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the astonished chief looked at it in further scrutiny, he realized
        that he did not press inwards- he had merely touched it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Chief?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…………”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not noticing anything strange, the nearby rescue workers wore a puzzled
        expression and looked at their astounded-looking chief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Did anything happen?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……we have to remove this thing from this place.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Huh?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…Use the truck to transport it away. Hurry.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, the chief became unusually composed. In a calm voice he
        instructed the workers to work swiftly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though the workers were still slightly baffled, they knew that the
        object of unknown origins before their eyes should be removed from the
        scene immediately. So they promptly heaved the silver sphere up to the
        shelves in the truck.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Huh? Where’s the chief?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A member abruptly noticed that the chief, who was just overseeing them
        seconds ago, had disappeared. And from behind the backs of the busy
        rescue workers, the sound of an engine starting could be heard.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the driver’s seat of the truck, slowly driving the truck away from
        the scene, is the expressionless chief of rescue workers. But when the
        rescue workers noticed this, it was already too late. The truck which
        carried the silver sphere had vanished among the streets in the dawn
        light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Five hours later, at the outskirts of the city, a police patrol
        discovered the lost truck, with the chief still sitting at the driver’s
        seat, unconscious. However, the truck which transported the silver
        sphere on its shelves was now only left with an empty husk.

      <p class="calibre3">“……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…Excuse me? Is this Mackenzie’s house?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Yeah. This is the name of the owner of this house.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……Then, who is…..Sir King of Conquerors Alexander…?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I am he.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……Ah, ah. Err… I see. Ah, haha……ah. Then can you sign over here?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Sign? Alright……done!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Thank you very much. So-sorry for disturbing.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Hmm. No problem at all.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the second-floor bedroom of Glen Mackenzie’s house he was so
        accustomed to staying as if it is his own house, Waver Velvet woke up
        from his dreams.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sun had fully risen. Treating the day as a holiday, he lay idly on
        the bed, refusing to get up. So it shouldn’t hurt if I lie about like
        this, right?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everything that had happened until now was just like a dream. That
        unequalled, tragic death match and destruction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But the engraved Command Seals on the back of his left hand reminded
        Waver that this wasn’t a dream.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Rider’s Master, Waver had witnessed the fierce battle between the
        five Servants yesterday night - this is an undeniable fact.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that moment, for the first time in his life, this youth entered into
        the battlefield; for the first time, weaving in between life and death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Trepidation, horror; he had never felt them so strongly before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, what was left in his heart at this moment……wasn’t fear-related
        emotions. Instead, impulses full of delight and excitement surged up in
        his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver did not have any accomplishment yesterday night- every action was
        decided by Alexander, alone. As a Master he had only stood beside his
        Servant, witnessing everything from the side. Worse still, he fainted at
        the climax of the battle, rendering him unable to catch the final result
        of the fight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nevertheless, Waver still felt that it was a very meaningful battle. The
        things and values he obtained from it, looks like only he understood
        them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…not daring enough to even show up before me, coward; you are not fit
        to be my opponent at all…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These words were used to insult Lancer’s Master. Lord El-Melloi, someone
        Waver hated and feared, was laughed at by Rider as a coward.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But the valor Rider held with pride was merely rash idiocy in Waver’s
        eyes. If he had been the one who planned the battle strategy, he would
        let his Servant cross swords in the battlefield, whilst as a Master, he
        would hide himself behind the curtain to observe the progress of the
        combat- which is the same tactic as Kayneth. This is what is called as
        proper battle tactics.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">But…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…the man who is most befitting to be my Master must be a valiant one
        who charges into the battlefield together with me…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course Waver wasn’t the type of person who can charge into the enemy
        beside Rider. Hiding beside the bridge, he was actually so terrified
        that he scrambled into the chariot, wanting to escape immediately.
        However, this reaction had been mistaken as an act of valor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nonetheless, at this time these things needed not to be pursued further.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter what his reasons were, Waver could still clearly remember the
        feeling of Rider’s hand on his shoulder - so broad, so strong.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Yes. This type of person IS my Master.” Rider had really said that to
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to Lord El-Melloi- the prodigy, famous lecturer, someone to
        whom Waver cannot hold a candle at one time, Waver was way superior
        then.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His value was finally approved- come to think of it, this was the first
        time someone acknowledged his ability.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although praises and slanders are but meaningless things, for this youth
        who had never been praised by anyone before, being praised by someone
        else was really exhilarating.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That is why Waver was on seventh heaven right now. No matter how he
        tried, he could not contain his excitement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although his Servant did not treat him with the courtesy demanded by a
        Master and had always called Waver by his first name, yet, no matter how
        disrespectful this obstinate was, Waver should at least feel grateful
        towards him now. After all, Rider was the first one to value him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…………”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tortured by his complicated thoughts, Waver stuffed his head under the
        covers. From today onwards, what type of attitude should he employ when
        he treats that giant Servant of his?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, suddenly Waver realized that the usual snores beside his
        ears in the mornings were absent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver lifted his head from the covers and found out that, Rider who
        usually sleeps on the bed, was not there. For someone who abhorred
        spiritual form, he would not simply cancel his physical form and revert
        to spiritual form without any good reason. Besides, even if he had
        dematerialized, as his Servant, it is impossible for Waver not to feel
        any of his presence at all. So there is only one possibility- Rider was
        not in the house.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver started to think calmly. He had overslept this morning, so it was
        not unusual for Rider to rise earlier than him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the problem at hand is that Rider was not within the house,
        which meant that Rider went to other places alone without Waver’s
        permission-
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the stairs of the corridor, footsteps could be heard coming up the
        stairs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From these heavy footsteps, Waver could tell that it was Rider, thus
        feeling slightly relieved. However, recognizing the meaning of such
        heavy footsteps, Waver paled immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Oh, so you are awake, eh? Kiddo.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider’s voice was accompanied by his huge torso which appeared at the
        door. And regarding the thick suit of armor he was wearing… Though Waver
        had gotten used to the weird occurrences, he still found it to be an
        alien and unimaginable thing. If this extremely strange sight were to be
        seen by the Mackenzie couple, he feared that the hypnosis he casted on
        them would be nullified very quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, Waver had, with some difficulty, managed to convince the
        Servant who downright refused to dematerialize, to stay at the first
        floor and not moving around as he liked… Of course, that was the case,
        until this morning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……You…went downstairs dressed like this?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Don’t be scared, okay? The old couple of this house had left early in
        the morning. So there are only two of us now. I went downstairs to
        receive the express delivery package.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looks like Rider also knew to try his best not to be seen by the
        Mackenzie couple. Waver, who got slightly relieved at this, suddenly
        noticed something amiss. Nervously, he examined Rider from head to toe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the hands of the giant was a small package with the express delivery
        label on it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……So you went to the main entrance in this costume?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I have no choice what. We cannot send the delivery man away without
        showing any gratitude, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">It was already too late.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But luckily he was not noticed by anyone staying nearby, only by the
        postman who comes occasionally to deliver parcels. In spite of that, it
        was very likely for the word to spread from the postman, saying
        something like there was a warrior in Greek armor in this house. All he
        could do was to pray that people would treat his words as a prank.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Say, this isn’t even your parcel, so you don’t have to express your
        gratitude, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Huh? No. It is my parcel.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……What!?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Showing off, Rider let Waver see the parcel- “Fuyuki Town Miyami
        District, 228 Mackenzie Residence. To the King of Conquerors Alexander”.
        This preposterous content was openly displayed on the post receipt. On
        the Distributor column, the words “Specializing in Selling Character
        Goods: Animan Bar Nanbo Shop”.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What is this? Rider, explain.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I am just trying out this mail-order thingy. There were quite a lot of
        products which caught my attention on the advertisement section of
        ‘World Military Monthly’.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Eh? Mail-order?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he thought of it, Waver finally understood why Rider further
        requested for a postcard when he asked Waver to buy military magazines
        and recording tapes. At that time, Waver hadn’t the faintest idea what
        the postcard was for… No, it should be that Waver did not even
        considered it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I said, where on earth did you learn mail-order from?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Heroic Spirits can obtain knowledge from the Hold Grail, it
        would not have been to the extent of learning how to use mail-order.
        Waver was very reluctant to believe these were all true.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Huh? This type of trifle, didn’t they explain it clearly at the back of
        the magazine and the recording tapes? Just look at it for a while and
        you’ll understand.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “When did you see those advertisements……huh? Where did you get the money
        for the mail-order?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Don’t worry. I have already paid in full.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Laughing cheerfully, Rider returned Waver’s wallet to him. Apparently,
        he had taken his Master’s wallet without permission while he was
        sleeping.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This man is so naïve that he had even wanted to buy an invisible bomber;
        no one would know what expensive merchandise he had purchased this time.
        Appalled, Waver took out his wallet and checked the sum of money inside,
        whilst holding back his tears.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After checking, he realized that the number of 10 000 yen notes inside
        remained unchanged; just that a few thousand yen notes were missing.
        Waver heaved a huge sigh of relief. Because he had collapsed in relief,
        Waver’s fury at Rider for taking his wallet without permission had
        diminished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This teenager was not even aware of his helplessness: Is he considered
        lucky or unlucky?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for Rider, he was beside Waver, humming a tone while opening the
        parcel happily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Hoho!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He shouted in joy after opening it.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Not bad! Not bad! I like it very much. The real product looks even
        nicer than the one in the photographs.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……A T-shirt?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider removed an XL sized T-shirt from the parcel. No matter how Waver
        looked at it, it looked just like another cheapskate product. At the
        front part of the shirt, an eye-catching logo was imprinted on top of
        the world map - "The Admiral’s Great Tactics". It looked like one of
        those products from the games segment published in on the front page of
        the special edition of the magazine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It is really not bad. After I noticed Saber yesterday night, I had a
        sudden inspiration too. If I wear contemporary styled clothes when I go
        to the streets, you wouldn’t mind, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver’s Heroic Spirit abhorred spiritual form and strongly preferred his
        physical form. Although Waver had headaches over this matter, the silver
        lining was that at least Rider did not think of going for window
        shopping in the streets. Now he is in deep trouble. Waver was angry to
        the extent of wanting to curse Saber (who gave Rider such an idea) and
        her Master to death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Meanwhile, Rider had tried on his new shirt and was displaying various
        poses, drawing simple happiness from it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Wahaha! Just like what I wanted- the effect of having the whole world
        on my chest. Haha! Really makes me feel happy.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……ah, ahh. Yeah, yeah.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What if he continued to cover his head and sleep over it? If he did so,
        he would banish the view of this elated Rider, wearing a T-shirt from
        his sight; and to escape back to gentle sleep. Currently, this is the
        best idea Waver could think of. When he gets up again next time, the
        world would be a better place, right?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Such a tempting notion had to be abandoned as Waver thought of what
        Rider would do next.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……Hey Rider, wait. I said, wait!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Noticing that Rider was about swagger out of the house, the nervous
        Waver stopped him immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Where are you going?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Do you have to ask that? To the streets, of course. To show those
        peasants the new look of the almighty King of Conquerors.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To wear only a T-shirt amidst the cold wind in November was already
        abnormal enough. To top it off, his valiant body was only covered in a
        T-shirt, nothing else.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“At least wear trousers before you go out!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Huh? That thing that causes you to stumble? Oh yeah. Come to think of
        it, everyone in this country wears that thing.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking slightly troubled, the brown giant who did not even wear
        underpants held his forehead with his fist, whilst asking Waver
        seriously:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Do I really have to wear that?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“That is a must.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he had not washed his face yet, Waver’s sleepiness had gone up
        in a puff of smoke.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This inconsiderate, ignorant-to-common-sense muscular idiot who’s as
        lacking in manners as a gorilla… Once Waver thought of the countless
        allowances he had made for him, he could not help but to get angry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Let me get this clear. I will not go to the streets to get super
        big-sized pants just for you. I’ll definitely not go.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What didya say?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With an exaggerated look, Rider stared at Waver. But Waver would not
        give in this time - he had set his determination with an iron-hard will.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hey punk, are you going against my majestic achievements?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Your majestic achievements and your trousers are two completely
        irrelevant things! Before you go out to enjoy yourself, show me what you
        can! Kill at least one of the opponents’ Servants!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Eh? You are quite an impatient fellow. You can engage a Servant in a
        combat anytime you want, you know.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “So do it now! Kill at least one of them! If you do that, I’ll buy you
        trousers or anything you want.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Showing a sudden solemn look, Rider became silent.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……Oh I see. Understood. For now, as long as I present you the
        decapitated head of the enemy, you swear that you would get me a pair of
        trousers?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Rider who gave in with such surprising alacrity, Waver felt very
        helpless instead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……So you really want to go to the street in this T-shirt only?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ain’t the King of Knights doing the same? As the King of Conquerors,
        how can I be lagging behind her? And no matter what, I like the design
        of this shirt very much. It fits well with the conqueror outfit.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This idiot without any tastes get was praised down the generations as a
        hero; is this a dry joke from the historians from the past? Waver’s
        train of thoughts subconsciously flew past time and space and returned
        to the distant past.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this exact moment, boom! An ear splitting explosion reverberated into
        Waver’s ears.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No, to be specific, it was not a sound, but a hearing stimulus. It
        directly attacked Waver’s sensitive nerves of a magus - in other words,
        a magecraft impulse.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What was that? ......At the east.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As a Servant Alexander could also felt the stimulus clearly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the open curtains, one could see a layer of cloud dispersing in the
        clear sky. Although the pattern of the cloud looked like those clouds
        formed by fireworks, the twinkling glow did not look like normal
        fireworks smoke at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Despite the fact that Waver could see the smoke clearly, because it was
        formed due to magecraft, people besides magi could not see it. The same
        goes to the noise. To a normal person, it was but a sound of normal
        fireworks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“That position…is where Fuyuki church is, right?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As one of the Masters participating in the Holy Grail War, Waver had at
        least some basic knowledge. So he understood the meaning behind the
        signal immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the supervisor of the war, the Holy Church would send that signaling
        fire every time it has something crucial to inform the Masters. This is
        the most appropriate means to inform the Masters, as the Hold Church
        would not have the faintest idea where they would be.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Is it something related to us?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver struggled to find the best answer to Rider’s question.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Cannot say that it is totally unrelated to us. How should I put it……”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In fact, Waver did not announce to the Holy Church his identity as a
        Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As long as he has a Servant on the grounds on Fuyuki city, naturally his
        position as a Master is established. So there was no need at all to do
        things under the Church’s thumb - Waver decided. After all, he had
        obtained the holy relic through unscrupulous means. If he did anymore
        extraneous things, would he land himself into deep trouble?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, it would be safe if he ignored the convention called by the
        Fuyuki Church. A meeting for all the Masters called by the supervising
        Holy Church, what emergency could it be? Normally it would be due to
        amendments to the rules, addition of extra conditions… Besides, it might
        also announce new information next.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This information might be the key point to the battles henceforth. From
        the current situation, it would be more beneficial if he listened to the
        supervisor’s suggestions. And if they were some regulations which
        restrict him, when the time comes, all he had to do is just to ignore
        them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Rider, we’ll discuss about the trousers some other time. I have some
        other things to prepare right now.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “What are you so afraid of? It is hard to get such a nice weather for
        strolling.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Throwing the disappointed Rider aside, Waver started doing his
        preparations.
