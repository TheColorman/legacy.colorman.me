      <p class="calibre3">Two o'clock A.M. -</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The streets fell asleep into a silence deeper and more complete than
        usual. Even the resident night-owls - perhaps terrified by the repeated
        cases - obeyed the appeal to self-imposed curfews and were submissively
        drawn into their homes. Even the shadows of cars disappeared from the
        road's surface. The asphalt, clearly lit by street lights alone, was
        frozen by the air of the winter night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This townscape where human life had completely ceased looked like it
        belonged in a scene with toys stretched to life-size. If a place beyond
        the recognition of normal humans was called an 'alien world', then that
        was, without a doubt, what nighttime Fuyuki was.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A single heroic horse sprinted cross that bizarre landscape as though it
        ruled over the place. Waver was being carried on its vigorous back,
        hurrying towards his place of death. Directly behind him was the massive
        and magnificent chest of the King of Conquerors, so close that even its
        pounding heartbeats were transmitted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if he were to survive this night, Waver would never forget this
        tense, silent exaltation. There was a time known in the world as the
        'moment of truth'. When the soul, bared and released from all deception
        and embellishment, took in the sweeping view of the world in its true
        state, there existed an instant that knew nothing but the shaking of the
        heart. Surely, that was what he was reflecting upon right now. The
        instant when any and all of the world's mysteries and paradoxes were
        comprehended and yet remained unanswered. The instant the meaning of
        existence and the value of death could be clearly grasped even without
        words. It was a time of supreme bliss, of release from all of the
        bewilderment and uncertainty, the hardships of human life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The warhorse leisurely slipped out of the sleeping city and jumped
        toward the riverbank, filled with still water in the color of darkness.
        In the still night, the great bridge they were aiming for was lit in
        white by the brilliance of hollow mercury lamps.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Rider, that's......"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Conquerors responded to the pointing Waver with a nod.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Standing on the bridge illuminated as if by broad daylight, his
        brilliantly golden, majestic appearance radiated all the more, as though
        sneering at such counterfeits as artificial light. The remorseless
        coldheartedness of his eyes' deep crimson glint froze Waver's entire
        body with fear even when they were hundreds of meters apart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Servant Archer, King of Heroes Gilgamesh -</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It wasn't that he hadn't prepared himself. From the beginning, he had
        understood that this was an unavoidable opponent. Even so, now that he
        was once again facing the real thing, the air of intimidation overcame
        all of the heart's defenses and came to crush the core of his soul.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You scared, boy?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider, who felt Waver's shaking, asked quietly. The boy frankly nodded
        without any pretense of bravery.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yeah, I'm scared. Or I guess, to put it your way, 'my heart is jumping
        with excitement'."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At his tense response, the King of Conquerors' face broke into a pleased
        smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's exactly it. When the enemy is mighty, the yearning for the sweet
        wine of victory becomes utter bliss. Oh ho, looks like you understand it
        now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bucephalus strode majestically, carrying the bravely boasting Rider to
        the foot of the bridge.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This would be their fourth and doubtless final chance meeting. The
        primordial King of Heroes and the legendary King of Conquerors. To the
        two of them, both occupying the wide four-lane road as though they owned
        it, the only obstacle that could hinder them was each other. The bridge
        was a one-way road; if one wouldn't back down, then the other wouldn't
        try to avoid. For a competition of tyranny between these two kingly
        beings, it was an inevitable, even fated battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bucephalus stopped his hooves, having halted after evidently sensing the
        will of his rider, who rewarded him by scratching his mane.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Boy, wait here for now."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">" - Huh?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider lowered himself from the back of his beloved horse, stood on the
        ground, and began walking with an air of composure towards the waiting
        enemy. As though it had been prearranged, Archer also began walking to
        meet him halfway, his heels ringing out haughtily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They were not warriors who simply competed with their martial skills
        alone. Seeing as they would both compete in tyranny in addition to
        crossing swords, they must also proceed through the proper channels.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Rider, where is your vaunted chariot?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he opened his mouth, Archer questioned him with restless
        anger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ah, that. Well. Aggravatingly, that Saber has carried it off."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider replied with a carefree shrug. Archer stared at him, scrutinizing
        with his blood-colored eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "...Did you forget what I had decided? You were informed that you would
        be defeated at your most perfect condition."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hm, now that you mention it, that's right."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With no fear for the intimidation, Rider, in an exceedingly bold and
        ferocious way, bent his lips and smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "True, my weapon has been consumed. But do not take that lightly, King
        of Heroes. Tonight, Alexander is incomplete, and therefore
        <i class="calibre6">beyond complete</i>."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was an incoherent manner of speaking, but Archer did not sneer at his
        nonsense, and looked over Rider's entire body with sharp eyes that
        seemed to cut into him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        " - I see. Yes, your
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="kingly air" class="calibre8">Aura</span></span
        >
        is overflowing. It is unusually stalwart. It seems you do not stand
        before me without some prospects of victory."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was the truth. While he had lost one of his Noble Phantasms, the
        amount of prana seething from Rider right now was several times higher
        than before. The three expended Command Seals that Waver had intended to
        'waste away meaninglessly' were unwittingly exercising an effect. When
        using Command Seals to activate ultimate authority, the more vague the
        contents, the more reduced the effects will be. On that point, as
        Waver's earlier orders all lacked concreteness, in terms of using the
        Command Seals, they were in effect wasted. On the other hand, a Command
        Seal activated not as an absolute command bending the will of the
        Servant, but with the consent of both parties, would not only enforce
        the Servant's actions, but also become a way to support and amplify
        them. In this case, similar to how Kiritsugu's Saber achieved
        <b class="calibre9">Spatial Relocation</b>, the Command Seals could at
        times make possible unprecedented things that overturned the normal
        methods of magecraft, things on the same level as 'Magic'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While the method of usage made little impression, since the three Seals
        conformed to the Servant's own will and furthermore were activated in
        succession, Rider received a definite effect from Waver's Command Seals.
        As long as he aspired toward the action of 'victory', Rider would
        receive an amplified amount of Prana support compared to normal.
        Frankly, the current Rider was, even more so than in the past, at his
        'most perfect'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hey, Archer. Speaking of decisions, wasn't there one more agreement
        from our banquet before?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The conclusion that we would have no choice but to kill one another?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Didn't we say we would drink up the rest of the wine before that?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider, with an honest smile unthinkable for one preparing for mortal
        combat, urged the King of Heroes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "At that time, some boorish fellows tried to spoil our banquet... but
        there was still something left in the bottle. You can't fool my eyes."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As expected of the king of usurpation. You are sharp-sighted when it
        comes to the belongings of others."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer, with a bitter smile, once again called forth a set of drinking
        vessels from the alternate-world 'vault' to his hand. The bottle was
        emptied, and the rest of the high-quality wine from the Age of the Gods
        at its bottom was poured completely into two cups. Like two boxers
        crossing their gloves, they solemnly knocked their cups together.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "One more thing, King of Babylonia. My last summation to you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Permitted. State it."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His goblet still raised, wearing a serious face while some rascally
        naivete remained in his gaze, Alexander began.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "For example, if my
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="Army of the King" class="calibre8"
            >Ionion Hetairoi</span
          ></span
        >
        was equipped by your
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="Treasures of the King" class="calibre8"
            >Gate of Babylon</span
          ></span
        >, it would undoubtedly become the most powerful army. Even that
        President of the West wouldn't be more than a break of wind."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hm. And?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Once again, will you not be my ally? If we join together, we can surely
        conquer as far as the ends of the stars."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the King of Heroes, as though he had heard some very
        satisfying satire, laughed out loud without a care.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How deeply amusing you are. It has been a long time since I have
        laughed this much at something other than a jester's foolish nonsense."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even as he laughed, his ruthless dreadfulness did not weaken in the
        slightest. Perhaps killing intent and great delight held roughly the
        same meaning to this golden ruler.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It is unfortunate, but I do not require a second friend. Past and
        future, my companion will only be one - and there need not be two kingly
        ones."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At such a resolute response, the King of Conquerors simply nodded
        quietly without showing his dejection.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That is a high and lonely kingship. I shall challenge that unshakable
        state of affairs with great admiration."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Good. Display yourself to your heart's desire, King of Conquerors. You
        are a foe worthy of my judgment."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two Kings gulped down their last drink together, disposed of the
        emptied cups, and turned back on their heels. Without turning around
        again, the two each returned to the bridgehead they came from.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver, who had watched over their last toast with a tense expression,
        went to meet the King's return with a sigh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Do you two actually get along?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Well, we'll be killing each other now. Or he could be the last opponent
        in my entire life that I will exchange glances with. I can't be
        ungrateful."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Don't be stupid."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver countered Alexander's joking tone with a stifled voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's no way you can be killed. I won't accept that. Did you forget
        my Command Seals?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That's right - yeah, that's it."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With an intrepid smile, Rider once again straddled the back of the
        waiting Bucephalus and unsheathed the sword affixed to his hip.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Gather, my brethren! Tonight, we shall mark our gallant figures into
        the strongest legend!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A wind of hot sand blew onto the bridge as though responding to the
        King's call and scattered the mist from the river.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The thoughts of the Heroic Spirits who had once seen the same dream as
        the King, drawn from beyond time and space, now came together and wove
        around the sword of the Cypriots.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A boundless blue sky. A horizon, blurred by the heat haze, that all
        would gaze at with a single heart in order to ascertain its very end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mental images of the brave ones who crossed time to seek the
        battlefield eroded even reality and turned the uninhabited great bridge
        into a great plain with a raging whirlwind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And one by one, the Heroic Spirits hastened to the stage of the decisive
        battle they were ordered to.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ahh......"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was the second time Waver had seen the spectacle of the arrayed
        <span class="calibre7"
          ><span title="Army of the King" class="calibre8"
            >Ionion Hetairoi</span
          ></span
        >
        in their magnificence. Even though it was no longer something to be
        shocked by, now that he knew the meaning of this ultimate Noble Phantasm
        which actualized the kingship of Alexander, he was overwhelmed by a
        sense of awe even greater than the first time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The shining elites of the cavalry - the bond of lord and servant they
        had formed with the King of Conquerors once upon a time could overcome
        even the separation of life and the afterlife.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was no place where their battlefield, sublimed into eternity,
        could not be actualized. If the King of Conquerors would again set forth
        in tyranny, then no matter where he was, his servants would hasten to
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was the pride of being together with the King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The joy of being able to battle together, of their hot surging blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Our enemy is the King of Heroes, mightier than tens of thousands - an
        opponent lacking in no regard! Come, heroic warriors, show the original
        Heroic Spirit the way of our tyranny!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh -&nbsp;!!!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Alexander's roar, the cheers of the arrayed troops rose into the air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only the solitary Archer was before them, confronting the great host
        which boiled like the high seas, but he did not show a speck of dismay
        and simply stood, imposingly blocking their path. His appearance,
        painted in gold, was like a single arduous towering peak. The air of
        intimidation was unmistakably unprecedented, precisely what would come
        from a demigod Heroic Spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Come, lord of the vanquishers. Now you shall know the true form of a
        King......"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the boldly boasting King of Heroes, the host of Heroic Spirits, led
        by the heroic horse Bucephalus, finally charged in a wedge formation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider bellowed as he spearheaded the vanguard. Answering his roar, the
        knights released a battle cry. To the surging waves and harsh thundering
        songs, Waver added his own small voice with all his might.
