      <p class="calibre3">- Before he realized it, he was on a burnt field.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Some kind of large fire had occurred.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The cityscape he was familiar with had turned to ruins, like the scars
        of battlefields that you see in films.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">When dawn broke, the course of the fire weakened.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The wall of flame that had been so high now sunk, and the buildings had
        mostly crumbled down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ......It was a wondrous feeling to be the only thing within all this to
        remain in his original form.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">He was the only living thing around.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Was he very lucky, or was his house built in a very lucky place?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He couldn't tell which it was, but in any case, he was the only one
        alive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I lived on, so I have to keep living - was what he thought.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It would be dangerous to stay here indefinitely - and so he walked on
        aimlessly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But it wasn't because he couldn't stand being burnt black like the
        people who had collapsed around him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ...Most likely, more so than the feeling of not wanting to be like them,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">there was a stronger feeling that bound his heart.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Even so, he held nothing like hope.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a wonder that he had lived up to this point, so he did not think
        that he would be saved now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">To start with, he cannot be saved.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter what he did, he cannot possibly leave this crimson world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was so absolute a hell that even a young child was able to comprehend
        it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">And so he fell.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps there was no oxygen; perhaps he had already lost the function of
        taking in oxygen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At any rate, he fell, gazing at the sky which was beginning to cloud
        over.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were the human figures around him, burnt black and quite shrunken.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dark clouds covered the sky, telling him that rain will fall soon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ...That would be good. The fire would end if rain fell.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the end, with a deep breath, he looked up at the rainclouds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though he could no longer breath. Just - it's so, painful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For the people who can no longer even complain, he spoke with frank
        emotions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was just so painful. Living was painful. So much so that he even
        thought he might as well just disappear now and be at ease.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a hazy consciousness, he meaninglessly stretched out his hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">He did not stretch out his hand to seek salvation.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Just - the sky was so, far.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He simply thought that in his final moment.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And so his consciousness disappeared, and the raised hand suddenly fell
        onto the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">......No.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">It should have fallen.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The powerless sinking hand was grasped by a large hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">......He remembered that face.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The figure of the man who was joyous from the bottom of his heart at
        finding a living human being, with tears amassing in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">- Because, he looked so very delighted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        So much so that, it was as though the one who was saved was not me, but
        the man.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">And so.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In such a way that he could feel envy for the him who was directly
        before death - the man said, thank you, as though he was expressing
        gratitude for something.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Thank you, for letting me find this.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As though he was expressing gratitude to someone for letting him help
        and save just one person - he showed a smile that could not be
        surpassed.
