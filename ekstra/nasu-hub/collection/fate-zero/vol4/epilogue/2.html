        “&ndash; I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will
        stand up on the earth.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A funeral procession progressed alone in the icy-cold rain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A young girl was the person who managed the funeral.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No expressions of sorrow or anxiety were written on her, but she only
        numbly went on according to the procedure of the funeral. While this
        expression made those who came to mourn feel her strength, none of them
        held any feelings of pity towards her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a funeral for a high-born clan. For elders, children who grew up
        under such a strict education should be able to bear anything. The
        mourners sitting here all held the same belief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; I
        myself will see Him with my own eyes &ndash; I, and not another. How my
        heart yearns within me… Amen.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then the coffin was buried into the earth. With some words of prayer
        from the others, the mourners left one by one. In the rain that once
        again regained its silence, only the young girl who took charge of the
        funeral and the priest who led the ceremonies were left behind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Good work. It was already very splendid as the debut of the next Head
        of the family. I believe your father would feel proud too.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rin just nodded in silence hearing those words of praise for her. Her
        left wrist had already been carved with the Magic Crest of the Tōsaka
        family. Her body was still not used to the Crest that had only recently
        been grafted and kept on inflicting pain on her. But there was no sign
        of agony shown on the young girl’s face, and she endured the funeral
        until the very last minute. Indeed, this willpower of hers didn’t match
        her age.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The letter that Tokiomi wrote, which entrusted everything to the
        Association after his death, was almost perfect; it was truly a real
        portrait of the man himself. The transfer of the body and the extraction
        of the Crest were all entrusted to the Association’s headquarters in
        London by Kotomine Kirei, Rin’s guardian. The Crest was handed to
        Tokiomi’s friends to be guarded securely to ensure that it would be
        impeccably transplanted onto Rin’s body in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Transplanting a Crest into someone will cause a great burden to the
        body, therefore it was best to transplant it to the family successor
        before his or her secondary sexual characteristics have developed
        completely. However, when the previous Head suddenly passes away, many
        unthought-of difficulties often would occur. But Tokiomi had overcome
        this and made impeccable preparations. He had passed the essence of
        magecraft that the Tōsaka house had complied over the generations all
        unto Rin without omitting a single thing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, due to the numerous procedures involved with the transport of
        the body and the removal of the Crest, over six months passed before
        Tokiomi’s body was returned home. As a result, people who attended the
        funeral procession today were only the few who knew the truth of his
        death, completely unrelated to the prestige and achievements the family
        had achieved in its homeland. A lonely funeral like this is probably a
        sin one must bear as a magus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei looked around the cemetery, which suddenly became desolate, and
        turned around to meet the taxi that had waited at the back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“It’s about time to let Mother come out, right?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; Mm, it’s about time.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tōsaka Aoi, who was supposed to organize the funeral as the widow, was
        unable to appear in front of the guests due to her health condition that
        required her to stay in bed. Although reluctant to let her come into
        contact with outsiders, Rin still wanted her mother to meet her father
        one last time before the coffin was to be buried beneath the earth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rin had been waiting for her mother’s arrival since before the other
        mourners arrived. She walked towards the car, helped her mother onto the
        wheelchair, and pushed it towards Tokiomi’s grave. In the wheelchair,
        although the widow still looked very young and beautiful, there wasn’t
        any expression engraved on her face; only a hazy, dreamy stare that
        looked into the void.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Mom, here, say a final goodbye to father.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing Rin’s urging sound, Aoi’s dreamy eyes finally slowly gathered on
        one spot on the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Her eyes slowly swept around the gravestones surrounding her, and opened
        her eyes wide as if having finally realized something.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah &ndash; What, Rin? Is it someone’s funeral today?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Yes. Because father passed away.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Oh my goodness! I’ll have to hurry and take out Tokiomi’s funeral
        clothes &ndash; Rin, go help Sakura get dressed. Ahhh what to do what to
        do. I haven’t prepared anything…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aoi, who was sitting on a wheelchair, sank into a brief panic. Then, she
        suddenly bent down like a marionette with its strings broken. Moreover,
        when she finally lifted her head up again, she showed a gentle smile
        towards the empty air before her, and stretched out her fingers in front
        of her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “See, my dear, your tie is skewed again. And there’s a string sticking
        to your shoulder. Haha, try to cheer up a bit. After all, you’re the
        father that Rin and Sakura are proud of…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aoi prattled on and on to the husband that only she could see.
        Meanwhile, Rin simply stayed by her mother’s side and guarded her in
        silence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tōsaka Aoi, who had received brain damage as a result of oxygen
        deprivation, was unable to communicate properly with Kirei and Rin
        anymore. Undoubtedly for Rin, Aoi had been an innocent victim swept up
        into the Fourth Heaven’s Feel just like her father.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, for Aoi who was no longer able to correctly comprehend reality,
        perhaps this was happier for her. Her heart had remained at that time
        when Sakura was still in the house and Tokiomi was still alive. She
        wandered in the spacious Tōsaka mansion, conversed and laughed with the
        husband and younger daughter in her memories, and lived on forever in
        the beautiful dream of a happy family.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only Rin was left behind in the real world by herself. She took care of
        such a mother, but could only look at her silently and was unable to
        move a single step into that happy picture. She hid the sadness that no
        one else could feel, bore the heavy burden of being the head of a
        magecraft clan upon her young body, and endured the pain of the Crest.
        It was truly a far-too-cruel fate for a young girl who was only a
        primary school student.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kotomine Kirei, however, thought that it was an incomparably good strike
        of luck that he was made the guardian of such a tragic girl.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could only feel joy through the other’s pain and suffering. To Kirei,
        who had known his twisted true colors a long time ago, Rin’s current
        predicaments were undoubtedly the best environment to make her grow into
        a sentimental girl. Since Kirei would be able to appraise everything
        from the closest distance, it was undoubtedly an enjoyment comparable to
        tasting the most outstanding wine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However &ndash; what angered him was the fact that he had never received
        such rewards.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though she was burdened with this tragic fate, the young girl didn’t
        shed a single tear. Not even a weak word was ever said by her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even now, before her pitiful mother who could not comprehend her
        father’s passing, Rin still kept a calm look. She forcibly suppressed
        her sorrow and grief inside her heart, and waited for her mother to calm
        down. This would have been a situation where other children of her age,
        who were spoiled to death by their parents, would never have been able
        to endure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rin had already acknowledged and accepted her fate, and was courageous
        enough to boldly face it. Such rare pride and self-control were the
        greatest virtues possessed by the young girl named Tōsaka Rin, but it
        was the thing that angered Kirei the most.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After having had her full of bitterness and pain, this jewel named Rin
        began to take on shape from the unshaped raw ore. He had originally
        thought that seeing the shameful behavior of her beloved mother would
        wound her soul, but he did not expect her to accept her mother’s
        weakness of becoming enthralled in dreams with a merciful and
        accommodating heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This young girl was advancing step by step towards the heretic road
        named magecraft. Perhaps one day she would become just like her father,
        and discard all the twisted evil of a magus and form a most righteous
        and balanced personality. Of course, that would be the most boring
        development for Kirei. He had originally expected very much to see just
        what kind of a twisted flower would bloom out of Tokiomi’s daughter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Keeping all of the secrets in his heart, Kirei placed his hand on Rin’s
        shoulders as if encouraging her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I will stay in Japan for some time… Is there anything else you’re
        worried about for the future?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… Nothing much. I’ve been too much of a trouble for you, but now it’s
        fine.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The young girl answered with a tough tone, not even looking at Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rin obeyed her father’s last words, and did not object to having
        Kotomine Kirei become her guardian. However, she found it difficult to
        cover up her spite toward him. He was Tokiomi’s assistant and headed
        toward the same battlefield, but in the end still failed to protect
        Tokiomi. Rin’s heart was still full of anger and suspicion toward the a
        man named Kirei till this day.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei only felt Rin’s inexperienced hatred to be laughable. What would
        the expression on this girl’s face be when she one day came to know the
        truth? He would be quite looking forward to see it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “We will meet again after six months. Then the second Crest
        transplantation process can be performed. Please take care of yourself.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…You don’t have to say a thing. I already know about.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I think that I will be mainly working overseas in the future. I’m
        terribly sorry to say this, but I think I cannot live in Japan. I am
        truly unsuitable to be a guardian…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If you’re busy then it cannot be helped. I will obviously take good
        care of mother and the Tōsaka family while you’re gone. You can go
        crusade against heretics or do whatever you like as long as you don’t
        bring us trouble.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hah, even Rin can bluff like this? Her tone today was sharper than
        usual. Perhaps today really was more painful than ever for this girl.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A rather sickening idea suddenly flashed through Kirei’s mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Rin, you will be the true Head of the Tōsaka house from today
        onwards. In order to celebrate this special occasion, I am giving you a
        gift.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he said that, Kirei pulled out a dagger from within his coat together
        with its sheath.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was the same Azoth Sword that was given to him by Tokiomi as a
        symbol of friendship. Today’s funeral also made Kirei remember the man
        who had passed away, so he brought this dagger along. It was also a
        little compensation for the man who had died by his hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This is what I received from Tokiomi-sensei in the past when he
        recognized the achievements of my magecraft studies &ndash; I think it’s
        better that you take care of it from now on.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rin took the dagger, pulled the dagger from its sheath, and studied it
        carefully. She caressed the leather of the hilt and the magecraft runes
        on the blade almost reverently, as if she could feel the warmth of her
        father’s fingers within.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Father …”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A small ripple suddenly appeared on the dagger that the girl held in her
        hands &ndash; a single drop of tear suddenly tumbled down the immaculate
        blade.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was the first time that Rin had shed tears in front of Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if having tasted the wine he had been waiting for too long, Kirei’s
        heart shook with joy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rin didn’t know anything. The dagger that she held in her hand and
        received her tears was once fully stained with the fresh blood that
        poured out of Tokiomi’s heart. Perhaps she would even consider this
        dagger as a memento of her memorable father and deferentially treasure
        it in the future. Of course, the pre-requisite was that she did not know
        this was the murder weapon that killed her father.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This extreme irony and the pleasure of violating a pure heart made
        Kotomine Kirei receive an insurmountable satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rin, who was crying with her head lowered, was completely ignorant to
        the priest beside her who was blossoming with a silent smile. She only
        held on tightly to the dagger of fate in her hands.
