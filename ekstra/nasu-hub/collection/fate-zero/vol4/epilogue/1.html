      <p class="calibre3">
        Every news channel on TV was reporting on the large fire that had taken
        place in Shinto last night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But even apart from that, there was still a gloom cast over today's
        breakfast at the MacKenzies’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The table seemed rather empty with one less person. The male guest who
        had been boarding in the house for some time had left for his home
        country the previous day due to some urgent issue. He had asked Waver to
        thank the MacKenzies for their hospitality and care in recent days, and
        apologized very much for not bidding them farewell in the face of his
        sudden departure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Alex-san must have safely returned to the UK, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Martha MacKenzie murmured with a worried look. Waver nodded calm her
        down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “He called me back from the airport this morning. That guy, doesn’t he
        know anything about local time differences?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver told this massive lie with a poker face. He himself, however, was
        quite astonished that he could lie as easily and simply as that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “He called you back? I really didn’t notice. Ah, but that kind of style
        really suits him.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a nod and a smile on her face, Martha turned her gaze back to the
        TV screen and then she looked gloomy again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… That’s still quite unfortunate, but then again, there have indeed
        been a lot of disturbances lately. But maybe that’s not a bad thing
        either. At least those insincere visitors might change their itinerary
        now.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the screen and the totally burned and barren field it showed,
        Waver could not help but feel deeply ashamed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The fire that had occurred close to the Municipal Hall was undoubtedly
        caused by the War of the Holy Grail. Although he did not know which one
        out of the three remaining Masters and Servants had created this tragic
        scene, he and Rider might have prevented this incident had they been
        present. That was why he found it difficult to suppress his deep regret.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This tragedy would not occur in the future. Though ended in the worst
        way possible, the alien events that threatened Fuyuki would not occur
        again. The fourth War of the Holy Grail, which had sacrificed countless
        innocent lives, had been put to a complete end last night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Remembering all of the tragedy that had happened back there &ndash; he
        felt that it could already be considered a miracle that he was still
        alive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Umm, Grandpa, Grandma, may I discuss something with you?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing Waver’s voice, which sounded different from usual, the old
        couple placed their coffee cups down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What is it?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah, actually… I want to take a break from school for a while. This is a
        decision I made after discussing it with father back in Toronto. Rather
        than going to school, at this time I’d like to do something else first.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Oh.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ahhh.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this surprising declaration from their grandson, the old couple
        couldn’t help but stare at each other and at him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But why all of a sudden… You don’t hate going to school, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “No, not at all… It is just that so far, I haven’t had any interest in
        anything at all besides studying, which makes me kind of regretful. So…
        Ah, I want to travel. I want to visit the outside world, so I can
        understand more things before I decide on what to do with my life.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Really?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Martha seemed to be very glad, and smiled while clapping her hands
        together.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Did you hear that, Glen? Waver-chan actually said something that sounds
        like what Alex-san would say.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this evaluation, with some relief and a bit of a lonely pang,
        Waver smiled bitterly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Anyway, there’s a lot of things you should prepare beforehand. It’s
        vital to do your homework first. Do you want to start by finding a job?
        … Ah, but here’s a problem. You can’t get a job in Fuyuki if you can’t
        speak Japanese, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hmm... Glen crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked deep in
        thought.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “There are also a lot of foreigners in this town. If I beg some of my
        acquaintances, maybe they can find you a solution.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“So Waver, will you stay in Japan for a while?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at Martha, who was wearing such a happy expression, Waver
        nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah, if it’s all right… If it’s not too much trouble for you?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Of course not.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Martha was so happy that she almost jumped with joy, and could not
        resist clapping as she replied. Her husband, Glen, just sat in silence
        next to her, but gave Waver a look of trust and expectation. The boy
        also sat up with his back straight and returned a solemn look.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre5">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver returned to his room alone, and reviewed this room which was
        bathed in the light of the dawn.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Eleven days&mdash; it was such a short time, but this room was already
        dyed with the color of the person who had lived there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were old magazines, paper dinner bags that he had thrown
        everywhere, and an empty whiskey bottle that had rolled into the corner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They were all traces of the other person who had eaten and drunk and
        rested in this room. This was a color that did not belong to Waver.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Was he a ghost? Or a familiar? Thinking of all that nonsense, Waver
        wondered. This was not a joke. If it was just a ‘soul’, how was it
        possible that such a vivid ‘color’ still lingered in the room?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this room would be no longer be dyed by this ‘color’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From now on, there would be only one person living here, and that was
        Waver. It would only be stained with Waver’s personality and his
        presence. The previous color would eventually be erased. It was
        inevitable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it felt regrettable and lonely, one certainty was that the
        color repainting the room must be extraordinarily vivid. Only so could
        it cover the color of ‘that person’, which was brighter than anyone
        else’s.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver sat down on the bed and pulled out the collector’s edition of
        <i class="calibre6">The Iliad</i> from his backpack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It had only been eleven short days, but the pages were already getting
        dark with repeated readings. The face of that eternally smiling man
        seemed to emerge before him again when he looked at this book, which he
        felt difficult to understand no matter how many times he read it. That
        man who had pushed himself forward with the adventures of the hero
        Achilles, who had challenged his own limits and finally made his own
        life into a legend.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And such a man had once been at Waver’s side, and had lived and fought
        with him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those dream-like scenes that he had described to Waver felt almost like
        lies. However, in the end, Waver was still attracted to his
        happiness&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could not deny that he envied him. He had even thought of going
        together with him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But he had left Waver behind after all. He made that decision the moment
        he invited Waver to become his subordinate and received Waver’s reply.
        Did that man make a wrong decision because of Waver’s wrong reply back
        then?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Why are you talking about nonsense like ‘subordinate’! Are we not
        friends? If you’re going to battle, of course I’ll accompany you!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If only back then Waver had been able to say those words in the wind,
        say those words as if they were equals…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then that man would definitely have smiled knowingly, and perhaps would
        have allowed Waver to mount his war horse in the end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But… The important thing is that in the end, I never showed him my
        ‘unwillingness’…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver couldn’t help but sigh. He was still far from standing on equal
        terms with that man. His own weaknesses were still all exposed at the
        end. He regretted, and he thought it a pity. Perhaps he was just too
        proud.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But he wasn’t anxious. After all, Waver hadn’t yet reached the age at
        which that man had begun his journey, and the marks of that man’s
        blood-boiling and amazing adventures could still be seen in every corner
        of this world. Waver would go and find all of that. Perhaps, one day, he
        would find the footprints of that man in some place beyond that
        far-distant sea.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, Waver’s eyes landed on the paper bag beside the television.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Come to think of it, that guy had bought this stuff with joy, but had
        left without even taking it out of its packaging.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver opened the bag and removed the gaming console and the disk within.
        He had even bought a joystick. Feeling his eyes suddenly become hot with
        tears, Waver forced them down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… I will not play this silly stuff.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But he had just decided to try new things, and one was right in front of
        him. Although it was silly, the idea was worth a try.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Yet, was this kind of stuff really that interesting?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver frowned as he looked at the bag. He then began following the
        instructions to connect the video game with the TV.
