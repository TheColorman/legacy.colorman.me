      <p class="calibre3">
        The re-creation of a so-called established work&mdash;is it a good or a
        bad thing?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To be made into an animation, or a game, or a novel; a sequel, a
        spinoff… I had once jumped for joy when I heard these news about my
        beloved work.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During my childhood, I had also greatly looked forward to another
        meeting with my beloved characters; I looked forward to seeing their
        heroics again. Until today, these remembrances are all treasures from
        the bottom of my heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But after stepping over the threshold of the new century, when I heard
        this sort of information about my beloved work, I always furrowed my
        brow, and my chest was always full of unease.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, sometimes this unease proves to be just paranoia. I also
        obtained many additional beautiful experiences from those sequels. But
        what is undeniable is that in many cases, all I feel is disappointment,
        depression and the incomparable indignation of having the precious
        memories of your heart tarnished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This so-called re-creation&mdash;is it a good or a bad thing?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ‘wish’ that it is ‘good’ still echoes in the bottom of my heart
        until today.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That feeling in the past, of hoping that the story would never
        end&mdash;I have not forgotten it to this day.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But, ‘feeling’ is calling out loudly ‘no’. Definitely nothing good can
        come out of this. The new producers only borrowed the repute of the
        original and used it to make money&mdash;that is all. The appraisal and
        reputation will all be shared equally with the original author
        regardless of whether the sequel is good or bad. In that case, who would
        be willing to pour their enthusiasm into the work? As long as the
        quality is passable, just sell a large quantity while the media is still
        stirring&mdash;this sort of situation has already repeated itself
        countless times. Now, what reason is there to let me optimistically
        believe that ‘this wish will definitely be communicated to the other
        party’?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘Yes’, ‘reason’ very unwillingly says. It is hopeless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now, the otaku entertainment form that includes animation, games and
        light novels is currently producing large amounts of profit as an
        ‘industry’. Yes, it is already an ‘industry’. Marketing principles are
        driving the cycle of supply and demand in endless acceleration. In this
        system where the ideal is that the producer’s benefit is paramount, and
        there is a continuous supply of consumers, it is extremely foolish to
        proclaim a work finished when it exists only as a single commodity. A
        limited number of ideas, in the process of being turned into games,
        animation, comics, light novels or even made into figurines, from
        re-releases, to repackages, to anthologies, re-translations and remakes…
        So-called ecology is recycle and reuse, wringing dry every drop of
        usefulness from the original work. And the trust of the fans has also
        been challenged in the process of collecting these countless products.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because, only the continuation of economic activity that has to do with
        the original work is the specific proof of ‘enduring love’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And the problem of degeneration of the original material, caused by
        recycling and reusing, is as meaningless as asking about the quality of
        recycled paper. Since the buyer is only going on buying due to inertia,
        the seller will care even less. Just like that, the dynamism of the
        economy is stimulated; countless fathers feed their families on the
        income they gain from this. Will anyone question this?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There is money to be earned from re-creation. Re-creation will bring
        benefit to all kinds of people. If one were to stand up and deny this
        public welfare, he will suffer the people’s condemnation, which would
        leave behind painful memories. He will lose his friends, lose his
        sponsors, even losing his wage that he uses to put bread on the table.
        I, who have understood all this, am already a mature grown-up. I have
        already learnt to watch for people’s moods, to respect the common sense
        and practices of the industry, to master the traditional virtues of the
        Japanese that is to smile and say yes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &mdash;&mdash;Is re-creation a good or a bad thing?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, there is passion poured into this. But even more, it is an
        economic calculation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many sequels have been derived like this, along with many things that
        profane the original work that are flooding the world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Walking in downtown Akihabara, I find that I cannot laugh no matter
        what. Surrounded by so many people who have the same interest, what is
        that negative feeling that is always entrenched in the bottom of my
        heart?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At last, I gave up trying to get to the bottom of it. Mm, I’m not good
        at holding on to those troublesome things. As compared to
        single-mindedly thinking very hard, it is still action that is more
        suited to my temper.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As compared to making irresponsible remarks to people, it would be
        better to make one re-creation that I acknowledge. As compared to those
        manufacturers, guys who are not involved and only know how to sigh are
        even more contemptible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, this is taking a very big risk. Even if one has extreme
        passion for the original work, if he does not have the skill needed to
        sustain it and the strength needed to finish it, he will definitely not
        succeed. And once he fails, the hazard is even more shockingly large. It
        is not only his reputation that will be damaged; even that which he
        loves will also be profaned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">But I wrote it anyway.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">To me, writing is like raising flowers.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Attracted by the beauty of the flowers, this emotion bore fruit in my
        heart, and scattered its seeds. Precisely because the seeds remained in
        my chest, I fervently watered and put fertilizer, dreaming of letting
        the flowers that once had been now bloom again, and let everyone
        experience its beauty.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I don’t actually have any ideals or assertions, nor do I detest the ways
        of the world; much less do I have any uniqueness that merits
        commendation. It is only that, in my heart there are always seeds that I
        got from other people. I like shootout films, wuxia films, science
        fiction films; I like Transformers, monsters of the universe, and
        western vengeance shows. Precisely because this love has already almost
        broken out of my body several times, I chose this profession. So this
        which I do&mdash;each time is a re-creation. Since I am like this, then
        how can I accept that it is denied? If it were possible, I would really
        like to stick out my chest and cheer loudly for it. Even though this
        re-creation industry before my eyes is empty of content, and does not
        know the meaning of shame, and is where parasites run rampant&mdash; I
        still believe that the joy of writing is a noble emotion.
      </p>

        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This book of mine, that wasted the entirety of more than one thousand
        and four hundred pages of paper for the sake of shouting out ‘I love
        Fate’, is now respectfully set before you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is a long and arduous fight. To be honest, I have poured
        immeasurable effort into this work. But from my perspective, this was
        all worth it. This is my answer; I hold on to this revelation every
        moment that I go through the process of creation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Is re-creation a good or a bad thing? … I think that after today I will
        not be troubled by this again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I will gamble everything I have, and continue to write pieces that I am
        pleased with, and I will use this as evidence to deny all negative
        influence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In short, it is like this. This is what the process of finishing these
        four books has taught me.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly looking back, I, who had once intended to stop writing right
        here… who is to say that I was not saved by this work that is Fate/Zero?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Yes, I have derived my answer.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dear readers, please be at ease. After today I, Urobuchi, will still
        continue to strive.
