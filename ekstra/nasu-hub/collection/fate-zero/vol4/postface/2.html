      <p class="calibre3">This is how his journey ends.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At long last, the journey of an individual who cannot be considered
        truly vile or evil, only a man with a mundane and ordinary wish as his
        goal, finally returns to its starting point, and the curtains fall.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Mistakes along every step of the road.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It is already ten years later when the man who did not attain salvation
        obtains his long-cherished wish.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ahhh &ndash; Well done, Urobuchi Gen."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finished reading all four volumes, I close the book with heavy feelings
        in my heart and raise my face to the sky before letting out a sincere
        word of thanks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Too cruel.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Too heavy.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">No one reaches salvation at all.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But despite these sacrifices, there are still some sparks of light
        remaining in our hearts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Creation and destruction are a pair of twins. Everything was swallowed
        up in crimson flames and all disappeared with the wind. Yet in the end,
        a new life budded forth from a desolate battlefield that should only
        have been left with infinite sorrow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This light was infinitely small compared to all that had been lost, but
        it was incomparably nobler as a result. We who can only watch can only
        feel touched by that light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        I only hope to add a little more value to the story.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if he himself did not succeed in the end, the heir to his
        aspiration will one day appear &ndash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        I firmly believe that the readers of this book feel the same as I do.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">An overwhelming sense of speed and pace.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The end came like an avalanche, raiding us one wave after another. The
        duels of Heroic Spirits, vivid like screenshots, made us almost forget
        to breathe. Numerous characters passed away one after another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The first three volumes were just a warm-up. Urobuchi Gen’s ability was
        finally displayed in all its magnificence in volume four. As you have
        already experienced, though your heart struggled helplessly under a
        heavy weight, your hand couldn’t help but keep turning pages to read
        more of the hellish cycle within.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And yet where did this relief and satisfaction come from? Though sorrow
        lingered within our hearts, not a hint of regret is produced.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A story in which a man failed his great aspiration also has a reason to
        exist. That is to show us a strength capable of summoning miracles from
        the abyss of despair. This strength, which connects the stories that
        come after it, had been deeply carved into my heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With the 4th volume, “Fate/zero” can no longer be called a side story,
        but a story that truly connects with canon. Different though their forms
        of expression may be, if they can support and complement each other then
        “zero” is no longer 0, but could even surpass the fully-developed ‘1’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre5">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Let me say one more thing. “Fate/zero” occurred ten years before the PC
        game “Fate/stay night”, describing how a hero of justice began his
        march.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is a tale that had ‘justice’, this extremely preposterous
        ‘lip-service' word, as its main plotline. It was truly a tiresome and
        unrefined story, and Urobuchi Gen made a visual feast out of it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">As a novel, Zero.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">As a visual novel, Stay Night.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Two very different forms and styles, and even the authors of the scripts
        differ.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The original author and the author of this book, Urobuchi Gen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There are a few similarities in interest between them, but deep inside
        the differences are rather great: style, ideas, areas of expertise;
        vegetarianism vs. loving meat, sleep time, and even the preference for
        girls! Ah, no, the last three had nothing to do with this Commentary.
        No, really.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Zero”, written by Urobuchi Gen, was naturally very different from “stay
        night” in terms of style.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the essences of both are surprisingly similar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the time of zero's publication, most readers were probably filled
        with anxiety and expectation. Because Urobuchi Gen is an excellent
        writer, there was always the possibility that he would strike cacophonic
        chords when he borrowed the world view of another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But as you can see, although the instruments in this performance
        differed from each other, the pitches of the two worked together in
        perfect harmony, and a wonderful ensemble was performed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Here, I want to thank the fact that such a famous performer could come
        and play the music of “fate”, and also hope that you enjoyed this
        miraculous creation. Although I shouldn’t express gratitude as the
        commentator, I would like to take this opportunity to express my utmost
        gratitude toward Urobuchi Gen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And I am glad that I’ve dispelled, if only a little, the anguish in
        Urobuchi Gen’s heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I can’t immerse myself in work,” Urobuchi Gen often told me.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to him, that was the reason why he couldn’t successfully keep
        creating pieces. In my opinion, however, all of this came about because
        of his unusual ability to calmly and thoroughly analyze and observe
        literature.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If, for example, I am a diver immersed in the story, then he would be
        the all-seeing nautical analyst on the water's surface testing the
        depths. His powers of understanding and analysis would undoubtedly
        overshadow me, who only knew how to dive beneath the water.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What is re-creation?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In recent years, Urobuchi Gen has often talked about this concern of
        his.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I respectfully call him older brother, but have often unceremoniously
        ordered him to do this and that. In my opinion, however, compared to me,
        he has a particular innocence.　
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        Something happened a while ago.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During a press conference to create a cross-media adaptation, Urobuchi
        Gen had answered:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “~ Then again, is it really a good thing to adapt the story, which you
        wrote after so much work, into an anime or a game? You would only have
        shown it to the world after you believed it was complete. I hope you
        consider what would happen if you changed the media. It can only become
        ‘something completely different’, moving further and further away from
        its original, complete form. I hope you will realize that. ~”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There are a number of “original authors” who, though faintly aware of
        its wrongness, still bow at the feet of the so-called “joy of
        expansion.” Even if their hearts are suspicious, when they are faced
        with their joy and personal modesty, such suspicion seems so
        insignificant. For this reason, we swallow back our questions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Urobuchi Gen is purely virtuous, pure enough to detect the fact that “it
        will be moving further and further away from its original, complete
        form.” This is almost similar to the virtue of a samurai.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And because of this, he would have the so-called “Re-creation Stress.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Urobuchi Gen also said this:</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Commercial re-creation isn’t good. A non-commercial re-creation is
        good~”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Exactly. In writing “Fate/zero”, he didn't have even the slightest
        intention of going commercial, and only wanted to write “his ideal
        Fate”. That innocent wish was not stained with anything unnecessary or
        any factors that placated modern trends. Of course, he himself
        understands better than anyone else that his own way of life is
        incompatible with modern society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Would the reader approve of his own particular moral values &ndash;?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Fortunately, “Fate” is a critically acclaimed work. It is the support of
        many readers that helped guide Urobuchi Gen and “his beloved Fate" onto
        the right path.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">No, it should be said that he never went astray.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was perhaps inevitable that “Fate/zero” became a saga of blood and
        tears, describing Emiya Kiritsugu’s progress in blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many people were aware of their own hypocrisy and planned to stop
        writing thus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even more people believed in their love of the original, and so chose to
        continue writing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        I only hope to add a little more value to the story.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if he himself did not succeed in the end, the heir to his
        aspiration will one day appear &ndash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        It is easily said, but Nasu Kinoko couldn't help but feel sad in his
        heart when he realized that the times when Urobuchi Gen would casually
        say at 1am, “How does this sound?” and then recount a series of
        unexpected plots was coming to an end.
