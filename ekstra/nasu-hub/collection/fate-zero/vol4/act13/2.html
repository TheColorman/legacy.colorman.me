      <p class="calibre3">
        In the cool morning air, Emiya Kiritsugu appeared before a certain
        abandoned house in Miyama.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was an old building built many decades ago, bereft of renovations or
        maintenance. The courtyard even possessed a storage room built in the
        previous era. To be exact, this was the place he had bought as a
        preparatory headquarters for Irisviel. Considering that even Einsbern
        Castle, with its location beyond city limits, had already been attacked
        by enemies, it became clear that purchasing this hiding spot had been
        far from meaningless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber was not here. Normally, he could feel the Servant’s presence
        through his Command Seals, but now he felt nothing. Perhaps she was on
        her way to Rider’s headquarters. Realizing this, Kiritsugu planned to
        follow her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It would be very easy to assassinate an apprentice magus like Waver once
        his hiding spot became known &ndash; however, he could only make his
        move once Saber had lured away the opposing Servant. Kiritsugu had also
        followed Tōsaka Tokiomi, who had left Fuyuki Church by himself, all the
        way to the Tōsaka house last night, but hadn't found any opportunity to
        strike. He had felt Archer's surveillance over the situation from some
        unknown location. If he had boldly struck his Master under such
        conditions, it would have been nothing short of suicide.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he had affirmed the target’s location, Kiritsugu didn’t go to
        the scene straightaway. Instead, he rushed to this abandoned building
        serving as temporary headquarters.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It wasn’t his intuition, but a premonition comprised of many factors… he
        feared that this would be his last chance to communicate with his wife.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now, with three Servants already fallen in battle, Kiritsugu was very
        aware of the situation surrounding Irisviel, the ‘Vessel’ of the Holy
        Grail. Had his heart been fragile, he would never have come here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The meeting with his wife was now a trial for Kiritsugu, in a way his
        punishment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sacrifice required for the Holy Grail he sought was the life of the
        woman he loved dearly &ndash; he had to face that fact without showing
        even a sliver of indecisiveness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he could overcome this trial, then the Emiya Kiritsugu that emerged
        would be able to defeat all sentiment in his heart and remove all doubt.
        Prudently and concretely, just like a machine, it was certain that he
        would hold the Holy Grail in his hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, for the self called a weapon of war, this was the final and
        the greatest test.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he could not handle it… then that meant every dream in the chest of
        the man called Emiya Kiritsugu held no meaning at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Standing in front of the door leading to the underground storage,
        Kiritsugu knocked out a pattern according to their arranged password.
        Soon, Maiya opened the heavy steel doors from within.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu noticed the changes in Maiya before any words were said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya, whose eyes were full of nonchalance and nihilism in every
        situation, now had sliver of a nervousness flit past as if Kiritsugu’s
        appearance made her waver.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Are you here to visit madam?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu nodded wordlessly. Maiya lowered her head and said in a low
        voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Her current situation…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I know, I know everything.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter what, Kiritsugu needed to look at the scene in this
        underground storage with his own eyes. Moreover, he had long been
        mentally prepared for this &ndash; upon understanding this, Maiya said
        no more and stepped out Kiritsugu’s way, then walked towards the outside
        of the underground storage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel silently lay in the Magic Circle filled with prana pulsations
        in the corner of the dim underground storage. This figure provoked
        Kiritsugu’s memories.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu and Irisviel’s first meeting had been just like this. Brought
        by the father of the household, Acht, into the deepest part of the
        Einsbern family workshop, he had stood before an Irisviel deeply asleep
        within a sink of amniotic fluid.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the Vessel of the Grail &ndash; why would they give a contraption
        with only a few years' usage such a beautiful appearance? Back then, he
        had really felt it was unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Is this thing the Holy Grail? When he had asked this question of the old
        magus beside him, she who had been deep asleep suddenly opened her eyes.
        The eyes that stared at him through the amniotic fluid floating in front
        of her face, that gaze filled with dark crimson, had completely
        enthralled Kiritsugu. He could not forget it to this day.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">It was the same now as it was then.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel opened her eyes. She and Kiritsugu looked at each other, then
        she gave a small, gentle smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ahh &ndash; Kiritsugu &ndash;”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel stretched out her hand and caressed Kiritsugu’s face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even a simple movement like that required the current Irisviel to spend
        a relatively large amount of energy &ndash; her icy cold fingers
        convulsed a little in reflection of that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&ndash; Is this a dream? You really &ndash; came to see me again
        &ndash; “
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ahh, yes.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was easier than he thought, and he could still speak freely. It was
        the same as when he had sunk Natalia. Language and actions were not
        affected at all. No matter how tangled his heart was or how frayed his
        emotions became, his two hands could still complete the job with
        precision.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could obtain victory &ndash; he believed that firmly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now, Emiya Kiritsugu was prepared for anything and could completely
        guarantee the trustworthiness of his functions. The strength of humans
        was never something that bothered Kiritsugu. No amount of confusion or
        anguish could affect his work. For Kiritsugu, his mental system of
        recognizing a goal and acting towards it could function without being
        disturbed by any factor whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From this perspective &ndash; he was the most perfect tool because he
        had that fatal flaw as a human.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I… feel very happy…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel gently caressed the cheek of the man who can only be called a
        machine and said softly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “For being able to fall in love with you… to marry you… to have a
        husband, to have a daughter. In the fast few years… you gave me
        everything I wanted… I no longer have any regrets. Everything, all the
        happiness in this world, I’ve already…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… Sorry, there are many, many promises left unfulfilled.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre6"
          >I said I’d get you out of that eternally wintry castle and go look at
          the flowers blossoming outside, to look at the sea that sparkled with
          light on the waves.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre6"
          >I once promised you that I’d one day bring you with me and look at
          all those things.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that he remembered it, it had been such an irresponsible promise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“No, it was good enough. Mmm.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel didn’t complain about those promises that couldn’t be fulfilled
        and said with a smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “All those happinesses I didn’t experience… all that was left undone,
        please give them to Ilya. Your daughter &ndash; our most important
        Ilya.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that moment, Kiritsugu finally understood the reason why Irisviel,
        who was approaching the edge of destruction, could still smile with such
        strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“You must, bring that child there.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mother who bestowed her hope onto her child had no fear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was how she could face her own demise with a smile, with no trace
        of terror.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Let that child, see everything I didn’t see in my stead… let her see,
        the cherry blossoms in the spring, the clouds in summer…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I understand.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kiritsugu nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For a machine that only knew to obtain the Holy Grail, this was a
        meaningless action and yet another meaningless promise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Even so, he would still nod as a human.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After he had obtained the Holy Grail and fulfilled his wish of saving
        the world… the machine that had fulfilled its duty would change back
        into a human again, right?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that time, he would definitely remember his promise to his wife. And
        at that time, do the duty of a good father and love his child
        thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was something for the near future. It could come true after only a
        few more short days.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">However &ndash; this was not that time.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“This… needs to be returned to…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Quivering, Irsiviel placed her hand on her chest and concentrated all
        the prana within her onto her fingertips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, in her empty hands a golden light started to shine, enveloping
        the entire storeroom with a cover of warm brilliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Holding his breath, Kiritsugu looked upon everything happening before
        him. The light gradually formed a silhouette, then turned into an object
        that shone with a metallic sheen and fell into Irisviel’s hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The golden scabbard.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Iri…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This… is something very important for you. In the final battle, it’ll
        be definitely be useful…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Irisviel’s voice sounded even weaker than before.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That was to be expected. Irisviel, who hid in the Magic Circle in this
        underground storeroom in order to slow the speed of her destruction, had
        separated the last thing protecting her, the miraculous Noble Phantasm
        &ndash; Avalon • All is a Distant Utopia, sealed within her as a
        Conceptual Weapon &ndash; from her body using her own hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I… will be fine. Maiya’s here to protect me… so…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… I understand.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Upon calm contemplation.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, as Saber’s Noble Phantasm, Avalon had the ability to provide
        prana to the Servant. Now, since Irisviel could no longer participate in
        front-line battles with Saber, continuing to equip her with Avalon no
        longer had any strategic meaning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if this Noble Phantasm could slow the speed of her destruction, it
        did no good in the bigger picture &ndash; the most correct choice now
        was to repossess this Noble Phantasm from her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu took the golden scabbard, placed his wife’s weak body on the
        ice-cold floor, stood up, and said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Then, I’ll be going.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Mm &ndash; take care.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The words of farewell were very brief.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Emiya Kiritsugu turned and walked out.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya, who had been standing and waiting outside, couldn’t help but draw
        a sharp breath when she saw Kiritsugu coming out of the underground
        storeroom. Of course, she did not know the true meaning of the Noble
        Phantasm shining with light in Kiritsugu’s hands. Actually, what
        surprised Maiya was the change in Kiritsugu himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “We’ll go finish Rider’s Master today. Saber has already left, right?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… Yes. Just this morning, not too long ago before you came here.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Very good &ndash; Maiya, I’ll keep entrusting the job of protecting
        Irisviel to you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Yes, sir… Hmm, Kiritsugu?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as Kiritsugu was about to walk out of the door, Maiya stopped him
        in a dazed voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“What’s wrong?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maiya stared for a moment at the eyes that turned to her, then made a
        small sigh and said after lowering her head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It’s finally back. The expression that you had back then.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Really?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a low reply, Kiritsugu continued walking outside without once
        turning back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
