      <p class="calibre3">
        It was not yet morning. Kotomine Kirei was already waiting at the door
        of the Tōsaka mansion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had not come to this place since summoning Archer ten days ago. This
        was the Western-style mansion he had spent his time in as an apprentice
        magus three years ago, the one place in Fuyuki he felt closer to than
        even the church.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Welcome, Kirei. I’ve been waiting for you."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though a guest had arrived at an unusual hour, Tōsaka Tokiomi appeared
        quickly at the door after hearing the doorbell. Perhaps he had not slept
        at all since leaving the Fuyuki Church the previous night. Kirei bowed
        deeply to Tokiomi in the manner of a disciple to his master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There are some things I wish to tell you before I leave Fuyuki, and
        then I must bid you farewell."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So it has come to this... and on such short notice. To part with you in
        such a manner&mdash;I have my regrets as well."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi spoke these words, but there was no trace of guilt on his face.
        That was to be expected. Tokiomi understood that Kotomine Kirei was but
        a pawn the Tōsaka family had borrowed from the Holy Church.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To Kirei, the Heaven’s Feel would yield no reward, being a mandatory
        task assigned by unseen powers from above. Kirei’s parting from Tokiomi
        was not a rejection or a betrayal, but a release from duty. Coming to
        say farewell was purely an act of formality.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "At dawn I will board a plane and head for Italy. First, I must hand my
        father’s possessions over to headquarters. I may not be able to return
        to Japan for some time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh... Come in. Do you have time to talk?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Mn. It shouldn't be a problem."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei contained the feelings in his heart and stepped once again through
        the Tōsakas’ front door.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre5">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The more I think about your leaving, the more reluctant I feel.
        Whatever may happen, I hope you can succeed your father Risei’s last
        behest and continue to assist the Tōsaka family in fulfilling a wish we
        have always desired..."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi was now the Tōsaka residence's only occupant, but the guest room
        was nevertheless spotlessly maintained. Perhaps some low-level familiar
        under his control had been cleaning so as to maintain composure even in
        this time of intense war. When it came to Tokiomi, no less was expected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Though it is a pity your actions against the Einsbern family failed, I
        understand that you had good intentions. Perhaps this is the way that
        Executors work, but I hope you will duly inform me of the situation
        before and after you act in the future. Then I can be prepared.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi's magnanimous attitude made Kirei lower his head further.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "To have given you, my teacher, this much trouble at the last moment...
        I am truly ashamed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei raised his head, seeing the sincerity in Tokiomi’s eyes, and said
        to himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It is true that we met only because of the Heaven's Feel, but no matter
        what the circumstances, I am very proud to have had you as a disciple."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Kirei momentarily lost control of his emotions and laughed
        out loud. But Tokiomi, completely misunderstanding his disciple's
        intentions, continued to speak in earnest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Talent is not something to be taken by force of will, but your sincere
        attitude towards training as one who walks this path is something that
        even I, your teacher, am very much impressed with. Kirei, from this day
        on you can continue to fight for the best interests of the Tōsaka family
        as your father did before you. What do you say?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I could not wish for more."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei smiled slightly and nodded. Tokiomi, who for the past three years
        had constantly misunderstood his disciple's character and inner world,
        now also misunderstood the meaning of Kirei’s smile. And so he continued
        to speak even more happily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You allow me to rest assured. I wish for my daughter to learn from you.
        After this Heaven's Feel ends, Kirei, you shall be Rin’s master, and
        guide her as such."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then Tokiomi retrieved a letter that had previously been placed at a
        corner of the desk and passed it to Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Teacher, what is this?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Though it is written rather simply, it can perhaps be considered a will
        of sorts."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tokiomi spoke thus, smiling wryly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If&mdash;and the chances are very small but a possibility
        nonetheless&mdash;if something unexpected happens to me, then I have
        written here that the Tōsaka household shall be inherited by Rin and you
        will be her guardian until she is mature. Pass this letter to the Clock
        Tower, and all further procedures will naturally be taken care of by the
        Association."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Kirei did not stop at perfunctory verbal assent but sincerely
        accepted the responsibility that Tokiomi had entrusted him with from his
        heart. After all, Kirei was of the priesthood. It was his duty to
        fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to him with honesty and
        reliability.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Please trust me. Even though your disciple’s abilities are limited, I
        will make every effort to take up the responsibility of caring for your
        daughter."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Thank you, Kirei."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though the words were brief, they contained a deep gratitude. Next,
        Tokiomi picked up the thin, long black box that had been beside the
        letter and handed it to Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Open it and see. This is my personal gift to you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei opened the box. On the velvet-lined interior neatly lay an
        exquisite dagger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This is&mdash;"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Azoth dagger. It has been meticulously crafted from heirloom
        jewels. After it is filled with prana, it can be used as a Mystic Code.
        You have learned and practiced the ways of the Tōsaka magecraft; use
        this as the proof of your graduation."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei held the dagger in his hand and examined it carefully. His gaze
        fell upon the sharp knife-edge and for a long time did not move away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei’s face, devoid of expression, must have seemed full of gratitude
        from Tokiomi's perspective.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My benefactor... I will truly never be able to repay your great care or
        live up to your expectations."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "To me, you are the best reward, Kotomine Kirei. With this, I can set
        forth for the final, decisive battle with no regrets."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi said with a clear smile, then got up from the sofa.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei believed that moment to be an arrangement of fate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If one were to say that it had been a mere congregation of coincidences,
        then how could it have been that Tōsaka Tokiomi chose precisely that
        time and place to provide Kotomine Kirei with that dagger in the form of
        a gift? Was it all not an indication of inevitability?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I am truly sorry to have delayed you for so long. Will you still be in
        time for your flight&mdash;"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &mdash;Now Tokiomi was facing the direction of the guestroom exit,
        completely defenseless with his back to Kirei. Could this be a
        coincidence as well?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"No, you do not need to worry, teacher."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &mdash;Or could it be said that this was inevitable, that this was fate?
        That no matter how much he could have prayed or hoped, everything would
        have eventually been drawn toward the abyss of betrayal?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei began to laugh loudly, a laugh more cheerful than ever.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"There was never been a flight to begin with."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not even Kirei himself knew he could laugh so heartily. Moreover, the
        dagger in his hand struck toward the defenseless back in front of him,.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"... Ah?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Azoth dagger that had been a proof of love and trust slipped between
        ribs to directly pierce Tokiomi’s heart. This one strike by an Executor
        who had experienced countless battles could be said to be deathly
        precise. There was no intention of murder, and there was no sign of it.
        Perhaps even Tokiomi, who had been stabbed, could not understand the
        significance of this wave of pain in his chest for a brief moment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tokiomi staggered forward. Turning his head, he saw only Kirei, smiling
        brightly, his hands stained with fresh blood&mdash;but there was never
        the slightest indication of understanding in Tokiomi’s eyes even till
        the end. With only a dazed expression, devoid of anger, he collapsed
        onto the carpet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To his final moment, this magus must have stubbornly believed his own
        understanding to be accurate and refused to accept the real truth.
        Unerringly believing in the path he had chosen, moving forward without
        the slightest hesitation every time &mdash; what a man, to not wake to
        the truth even after having fallen into an endless abyss.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A sparkling aura suddenly surged beside Tokiomi’s rapidly cooling
        corpse. Shining with radiant light, the golden Servant materialized in
        front of Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hn&mdash;what a disappointing ending."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A condescending expression seeped out of those red pupils. Archer nudged
        the corpse of his former Master with the tip of his foot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I was anticipating he would make a last retaliation before death. Look
        at his expression. Completely at a loss. He was not aware of his own
        stupidity even till the end."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That was because his Servant was in spirit form at his side. It was not
        illogical for him to let his guard down."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing Kirei’s quip, Archer began to laugh loudly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Already, you have learned to make jokes? Kirei, your progress is truly
        great."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">With a serious expression, Kirei asked Archer.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You really have no qualms about this, Gilgamesh, King of Heroes?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Only until I grow tired of you. Once you cease to be interesting, you
        will meet the same fate as this carcass lying here. If there is anyone
        here who should be coming to a realization, it is you by right."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The reply was extremely sharp, but Kirei showed no sign of wavering and
        nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Indeed, he could not entrust his life to such a dangerous character. It
        could be said that this was a deal with the devil. A domineering and
        violent Servant with neither morality nor loyalty, whose interests were
        difficult to judge.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But&mdash;precisely because of this, they were a perfect match.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those at the pinnacle of morality had not brought Kirei the real answer;
        it was actually this Heroic Spirit, who was completely at odds with
        morality, who could become the goal for which Kirei would fight from now
        on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei rolled up one sleeve, revealing the Command Seals on his arm, and
        chanted solemnly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Let thy body rest under my dominion, let my fate rest in thy blade. If
        thou submittest to the call of the Holy Grail, and if thou wilt obey
        this mind, this reason, then thou shalt respond&mdash;"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I so swear. Thy offering shalt be my flesh and blood. Kotomine Kirei,
        my new Master."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The prana supply opened the moment the contract was completed. The
        Command Seals on his left hand, functional once again, glowed anew,
        accompanied by a burst of pain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The pact was ended; and so the strongest, most wicked team involved in
        the fight for the Holy Grail&mdash;here, under conditions unknown to all
        others&mdash;was born.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So shall we begin, Kirei? ... You shall command and draw open the
        curtains to this farce. As your meager prize, I will grant you the
        Grail."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No problem. King of Heroes, you will certainly also draw pleasure from
        this. Before you find the answer you anticipate, enjoy the jubilation of
        this battle to your heart’s content."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The gazes from the red pupils filled with a delighted light and black
        pupils immersed in gratitude intertwined with each other.
