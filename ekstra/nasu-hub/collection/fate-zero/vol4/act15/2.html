      <p class="calibre3">
        People remembered that day in Fuyuki city to be one of abnormal weather
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unbelievably, the daily north wind suddenly ceased, and intense,
        midsummer-like sunlight scorched the seemingly stagnant air, resulting
        in an unseasonable heat haze everywhere. Bafflingly high temperatures
        and humidity &ndash; inexplicable even to weather forecasters &ndash;
        occurred over a very limited region with Fuyuki city at its center,
        further fueling the premonitions first felt by the clueless townspeople
        when strange things had first begun to happen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The guerrilla incidents happening one after another in the city; the
        bizarre, appalling murderers; the disappearance of infants &ndash; not a
        single clue could be found towards a solution. There was no sign of the
        night curfew being lifted, and worse still, there had been the incident
        of the waste processing plant on the Mion River the day before
        yesterday. With these constantly bizarre incidents grating the nerves of
        the exhausted people, they could not help but feel that this peculiar
        weather was an omen of more calamities yet to occur.
      </p>

      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        Sitting wide awake in the shade of a tree, Emiya Kiritsugu watched as
        the angle of his shadow slowly changed with the blazing sunlight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        More than 40 hours had elapsed since he last slept, but his senses were
        still tense, never desiring rest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because he was in a dangerous situation, he had to time his breaks well
        and maintain a condition at which he could deal with things perfectly in
        crucial times &ndash; this was his experience as a professional fighter.
        Because the forewarning boundary field was already in place in key
        positions, when someone approached him he could instantly wake up. If he
        was in standby mode now, he could enter REM sleep within a few seconds,
        possibly dealing with his accumulated fatigue as well.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, Kiritsugu did not even spare a thought about
        such established caution. To cut off his feelings and maintain his very
        best condition was also one of his “mechanisms”, but under the state of
        being prepared to be scorched, he was able to surpass his limits and
        overdrive himself &ndash; this was another “mechanism”. The thing able
        to convert himself to such operational state was none other than the
        premonition of “settling the score” he felt under his skin.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, the thing Kiritsugu was anticipating for was by the side of
        the pond in the back of Ryūdō Temple, which was situated along the
        mountainside of Mount Enzō, east of Miyama town of Fuyuki city.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After confirming Tokiomi’s fallout and Kotomine Kirei’s comeback at the
        Tohsaka residence yesterday night, Kiritsugu launched an assault on the
        Shinto church immediately, but that which was supposed to be his
        headquarters was already empty. There were signs of humans being there
        about an hour before, so it was possibly a paper-thin miss. The delays
        during the invasions of the Matou residence and Tohsaka residence had
        cost him precious time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that point, Kiritsugu had completely abandoned his search for
        Irisviel. That’s because he came to the conclusion that if he continued
        to be attached to her, he would fall all the more into the enemy’s trap.
        If he wanted to have any chance of winning, Kiritsugu had no choice but
        to enter into battles not as a husband who lost his wife, but as a
        Master seeking the Holy Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        By relinquishing the “Holy Grail vessel” &ndash; the trump card of the
        Einzberns &ndash; Kiritsugu now had to participate in the Holy Grail war
        with terms similar to that of outsider Masters (not from the three
        origin families). The strategy of luring the enemy to make mistakes
        whilst utilizing his superiority and overlooking his defense was no
        longer viable; he now had to seek ambush opportunities to outsmart his
        leading rivals. Thinking about it, what made the strategy of jumping
        ahead of his opponents effective was that he could, from this point
        onwards, fortify his position &ndash; which was to look beyond the final
        stage of the battle &ndash; and to set up traps about it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the outside, the War of the Holy Grail was mending its image as a
        battle royale, but as the war progressed, it began to show signs of it
        being a battle of occupying each other’s camps. The ultimate goal was to
        hold the ceremony for the descent of the Holy Grail; but to secure a
        proper place for the altar was part of the victor’s path which could not
        be avoided.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In Fuyuki, there were only four points in the land containing the
        suitable spiritual ground to summon the Holy Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The first key place was Mount Enzō which held the natural cavern, the
        “Dragon’s Hole”. At that place, the “Greater Holy Grail” &ndash; which
        used Justicia as a foundation &ndash; was located. It was a secret altar
        known only to the three origin families, their favorite ever since it
        was prepared 180 years ago.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tohsaka family &ndash; which provided the ground &ndash; had the
        right to use the best spiritual leyline as their base. However, the
        prana overflowing from Mount Enzō was too powerful, and too dangerous to
        be used as a living ground to bring up the next generation of magi.
        Hence, they set up their stronghold at the next best spiritual leyline
        &ndash; the Tohsaka residence of today. Though inferior to the Greater
        Holy Grail, this place was sustained by sufficient spiritual power to
        summon the Holy Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Makiri were assigned to a ground when they migrated here, but
        because they realized that the spiritual aura of the ground was not
        suitable for the family’s element, they shifted their base, the Matou
        residence, to a different place. The original spiritual leyline was
        protected by the Holy Church who intervened later. Today, it was at the
        top of the hill on which Fuyuki Church was built &ndash; that was the
        third spiritual leyline. Far away from Mount Enzō, it was located at the
        outskirts of Shinto, which was at the opposite side of the river &ndash;
        however, it was not much inferior to the second best spiritual ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The fourth spiritual leyline did not exist in this ground originally
        &ndash; because of spiritual processing by the other three spiritual
        leylines, the flow of mana subtly induced an anomaly; forming a
        gathering spot after 100 odd years, which appeared at a certain location
        as a result of it. It could also be called a subsequent spiritual
        ground. Through subsequent investigations, the fact that it was
        sufficiently furnished with spiritual grounds to carry out the ceremony,
        was confirmed; and during the third Holy Grail War, it was marked as a
        candidate site. Today, this place was located at the centre of the
        developing residential area of Shinto. Nevertheless, there was a problem
        with it, in that a council meeting hall was just built recently on that
        spot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if Kotomine Kirei had taken possession of the “vessel of the Holy
        Grail”, in the end, he had to perform the ceremony at one of these four
        key spiritual grounds. If Kiritsugu went to those places, set up traps
        and could ambush him, then there was a high chance of turning the tables
        around.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With Fuyuki Church left unoccupied, Kiritsugu unexpectedly landed in a
        good position of being able to secure the Tohsaka residence and the
        Fuyuki Church &ndash; the second and third best spiritual leylines. The
        silver lining of the cloud; in order to use this to his fullest
        advantage, all the way till morning, Kiritsugu planted explosives into
        the two buildings, making them into traps. And then, since noon, he had
        set up a new position at Ryūdō Temple, and was on the lookout all the
        time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu anticipated that Kirei would probably choose Mount Enzō as the
        ceremonial place. His enemy had vanished from Fuyuki Church. Naturally
        there was also a possibility that his intention was to seclude himself
        from society, but for him to relinquish the spiritual leyline he had
        already secured in the first place, he would only want to perform the
        ceremony at the best spiritual ground &ndash; Kiritsugu thus
        conjectured. If he thought about it, after obliterating Tokiomi Tohsaka,
        his residence was also at Kirei’s disposal &ndash; but he had left that
        place readily, so what’s left was just the Greater Holy Grail at Mount
        Enzō.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Obviously, there was a non-zero possibility that all of these were just
        a bluff to mislead Kiritsugu, and that Kirei would return to Fuyuki
        Church or Tohsaka residence. However, because of that, Kiritsugu had
        already set traps so that if Kirei set foot in any of the buildings, he
        would not be able to return alive. After being bombed to death, if the
        “vessel of the Holy Grail” was still unharmed, then victory would easily
        be his &ndash; as for Irisviel’s life, Kiritsugu had already looked
        philosophically upon it as a loss.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he were to further increase his chances of outwitting Kirei, he could
        not disregard the Fuyuki council hall &ndash; the fourth spiritual
        leyline. As for that place, Kiritsugu settled on placing a familiar
        there for the purpose of surveillance. After being confirmed as being a
        spiritual ground, the “ground of origin” was left just like that without
        any spell-like defense being set up around it. Compared with the other
        three ceremonial sites &ndash; which were “hard to attack and easy to
        defend” &ndash; the council hall was not a strategic position at all,
        from the view of magi battles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hypothetically speaking, if Kotomine Kirei were to appear at the city
        council hall, then Kiritsugu would carry out a full-front assault. It
        was of course the worst development, but the risk of such a thing
        happening was also the lowest. If he acted according to priorities,
        whether he was right or wrong, the place he had to seize no matter what
        was Mount Enzō.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Maiya was not harmed, she would be able to secure the city council
        hall, and confront Kirei directly with her perfect preparations. But, it
        was futile to lament about it. At this point, he could only rely on
        himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, Kiritsugu recalled those times after he had lost Natalia. Come
        to think of it, his experiences of independent action without joining
        anyone, was surprisingly little. To have felt that unexpectedly, was it
        because Kiritsugu was always the one surviving in the end?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu thought about it, and felt that he had led a life distantly
        connected to the word “alone”. It could also be called a life much
        crueler than being alone. There was always someone beside Kiritsugu. The
        one making excuses all this while for killing or causing the deaths of
        those “someones” was again, Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Both Maiya and Irisviel were people he was destined to part with ever
        since he met them. Sure enough, as he thought, Kiritsugu was left on his
        own, trying to enter the final stage of the battle. To begin this way,
        and to end this way &ndash; this had to be Emiya Kiritsugu’s fate.
        Someone like him who had lost so many people &ndash; such absurdity was
        unforgivable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &ndash;The boundary field established at the temple gates sensed the
        presence of something approaching. Kiritsugu cut off his disorganized
        emotions, held his Calico submachine gun in his hands, and stealthily
        examined the grounds. Nevertheless, his caution was not necessary.
        Kiritsugu already knew the prana waves which approached him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Come to think of it, there was someone &ndash; who was the strongest
        reinforcement to him &ndash; that had not joined his side as an ally
        yet. At that fact, despite himself, Kiritsugu could not help but to be
        surprised and snigger. She was still alive. Though it was hard to decide
        that if this noble knight &ndash; which was not part of Kiritsugu’s
        tactics &ndash; joined him, whether she would be an “ally” or not.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though hidden, a Servant could not be mistaken about her own Master’s
        whereabouts. Saber was not lost, and she had come all the way to the
        front of the treetop at which Kiritsugu was hiding himself, and had
        stopped within a distance from which they could talk, but outside the
        perimeter at which they could exchange blows &ndash; a delicate distance
        indeed. A distance too far for intimate words to be exchanged between
        them; that was also the distance separating the hearts of this Master
        and his Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The slender figure in suit was as imposing as ever, but the exhaustion
        within her face could not be concealed. As a Heroic Spirit, physical
        fatigue was nothing to her; but the excessive exhaustion due to her
        worrying was a completely different matter. The commanding glint in her
        eyes during those times when she was waiting upon Irisviel, was
        evidently losing its force.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “ &ndash; Since yesterday night, I had been searching all over the
        streets for Irisviel. But, I still haven’t discovered anything……I’m very
        sorry.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Servant he did not think about and had left behind; Kiritsugu had no
        interest at all at how much time she had wasted within a night; and when
        he heard about her idle actions which were just as he expected, he could
        not even think of any words to answer her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even now Saber’s aim was still to “rescue Irisviel”.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From last midnight till this morning, within this time when Kiritsugu
        had steadily prepared the deathtraps for Kotomine Kirei, this Servant
        had probably sought Irisviel recklessly, and drove around in the city
        looking for her without even any hint of where she was.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Was that the willpower as a knight? The naively honest loyalty towards
        someone she had once served? …… Her actions were just a silly plan with
        no strategic planning whatsoever. But at the same time, it was also a
        stinging criticism towards Kiritsugu who had resigned to the death of
        his wife, and changed his strategies accordingly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Needless to say, she did not come all the way to this place to mock him.
        Saber was just stopping by at Ryūdō temple as part of her search for
        Irisviel, and sensed the presence of her Master. But to have to see her
        again the second day, and having to once again face the difference
        between their principles and their actions, he could do nothing but to
        ascertain all the more the conflicting principles between both of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the dim shadows of the tree, at that cold look from Kiritsugu, the
        dry premonition she felt within her heart returned. &ndash; Perhaps,
        even until the end of the war, she would not have the chance to
        respectably exchange a single word with her own Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……Well then, I will continue the search for Irisviel. If there’s
        anything, summon me with the Command Spell like last time.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After saying that, Saber returned to the temple grounds. Needless to
        say, she was neither called back, nor were there any words of
        appreciation before her departure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the viewpoint of the Holy Grail contest, Kiritsugu’s actions was
        the best plan &ndash; Even Saber herself understood that. Because of
        that, she could also decide without a doubt that it was safe to leave
        this place to him. She had no fear of leaving Kiritsugu alone. If the
        situation arose when the Servant was needed, the compelling force of the
        Command Spells could transcend even space and summon her to his side
        &ndash; she had already experienced that last night, and confirmed it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Whilst descending the flight of stone steps connecting the temple gate
        to the ground below, Saber squinted her eyes in the unpleasantly blazing
        sun.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The enemies to be killed could not be found, and the location of the one
        she was to protect could not be ascertained…… what’s left was just her
        definite intuition, which told her that she could not afford to waste a
        single moment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not even knowing where to go, she was spurred on from the inside by the
        tingling impatience.
