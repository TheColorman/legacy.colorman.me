      <p class="calibre3">
        The scorching summer heat, unusual for the season, had nothing to do
        with Kotomine Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ice-cold humid air sank into the darkness and was completely
        isolated from the bustling world outside. His location possessed all the
        ideal properties that would allow him to wait till night had fallen and
        then make his move.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The temporary hiding place that Kotomine Kirei, who had left the Fuyuki
        Church, had chosen was the blood-covered underground cavern that Uryū
        Ryūnosuke and Servant Caster had once occupied as their headquarters
        &ndash; that is, the water tank deep within the Fuyuki City sewage
        system. Moreover, this was the fated place where the Assassins he had
        summoned had been utterly humiliated. It was truly ironic that it was
        that memory which made Kotomine Kirei choose this hiding place.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The best testimony to the secrecy of this place was the fact that
        Caster, who had become the target of all Masters after Risei’s command,
        had managed to stay alive here after the chaotic battle in the Einsbern
        Forest. Rider and his Master were the only ones who had found and
        entered this place, but there was longer any reason for them to pay
        attention to Caster’s workshop.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After ensuring his own safety, Kirei reviewed the current situation of
        the war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On top of having eliminated Tōsaka Tokiomi, befriended Matō Kariya, and
        secured the Vessel of the Grail, he had also managed to keep Saber and
        Rider in a stalemate whilst his own whereabouts were unknown to all
        &ndash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All this was achieved within one day after his decision to return to the
        Heaven’s Feel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although luck did play its part, nothing in the world was meant to be
        perfect. Even Kirei himself was surprised at the fact that he had
        immediately changed the chaotic and senseless situation of the war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei had usurped and taken over the advantage Tōsaka Tokiomi had
        possessed at the beginning of the war. Archer, who had materialized into
        this world as the most powerful Servant in this Heaven’s Feel, was in
        Kirei’s hands. Berserker, who was a formidable enemy due to his natural
        differences with Archer, had also become Kirei’s puppet along with his
        Master. There was nothing else that could threaten Kotomine Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It didn’t matter who emerged victorious between Saber and Rider. The
        battle amongst Servants would end as soon as the victor was eliminated
        by Archer’s ultimate Noble Phantasm. On the off chance that both the
        King of Knights and the King of Conquerors managed to survive &ndash; or
        worse, if they came to an agreement and joined forces against him
        &ndash; then there was still the powerful Berserker to stop them.
        Although Matō Kariya was almost in ruins after the incident with Aoi,
        Berserker would automatically start attacking Saber and would not
        require his Master’s command.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Kirei knew that having three or four battle plans ready for the
        potentially unpredictable fight with Rider would be good enough, Archer
        did not agree to it. This battle did not belong to Kirei, but the King
        of Heroes. Kirei needed to respect the wish of the warriors if they
        desired a face-to-face rivalry. This was likely the biggest difference
        between Kirei and the other magi, who merely used Servants as tools.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was opposed to using even a single Command Seal on Archer. He would
        only get the opposite result if he forced a man with such a huge ego to
        serve another’s will. The best way was not to control this Servant as a
        pawn, but to use him as if he were an environmental condition, like the
        weather or the direction of the wind. A sailor could not control the
        wind, but he could dexterously control his boat using the sail. That was
        his reasoning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Archer had left for the moment because he didn’t like being locked up in
        this underground place. Kirei understood that Archer would rush back
        when necessary, so he did not feel uneasy in the leasts. Kirei did not
        regard this King of Heroes as a familiar, but as an accomplice with
        mutual interests.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In other words, there were more efficient ways to use the Command Seals
        he had taken from Risei’s hand. Even if Kirei possessed no Magic Crests,
        there were many ways for him to perform magecraft provided he paid the
        proper price. His chances of victory were high even if he were to fight
        an expert magus now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The final battle tonight between Servants will decide the Holy Grail’s
        final destination. As an onlooker, all Kirei needed to do was wait for
        the right opportunity. As a Master, his main concern was actually a
        battle of strategies beyond that of the Servants’ &ndash; Kirei’s
        greatest enemy would be in that battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Emiya Kiritsugu. He would be the only one still capable of taking away
        the advantage in Kirei’s hands at this stage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In his heart, Kirei had always looked forward to the duel with him.
        However, since the opponent was a thorough assassin, the kind of
        encounter that Kirei wished for would never come about. He would have to
        frequently consider the situation of the battle and continue to ensure
        his advantage if he were to create a scenario in which he could fight
        Emiya Kiritsugu face to face. If Kiritsugu took the upper hand, Kirei
        would definitely be finished without ever seeing what his opponent
        looked like. If that were to happen, then all would have been for
        naught.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Emiya Kiritsugu could not obtain information concerning this water tank.
        He was reassured of that. Had that not been the case, Uryū Ryūnosuke
        would have been eliminated even sooner than he had. He would not suffer
        a sudden attack from Kiritsugu as long as he remained hidden here. For
        now, all he needed to do was keep his opponent worrying and running
        around blindly. Kirei would be the one to decide the location of the
        duel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kiritsugu operated strictly according to logic. Kirei would predict his
        moves and turn that logic against him, misleading him until he had no
        choice but to voluntarily appear before Kirei &ndash; that goal was
        already finalized. All that was left was to wait for night to fall.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei cast his eyes to a corner of the darkness when he heard a painful
        moan. The Einsbern homunculus that he had gotten Berserker to kidnap was
        lying there face-up. She wasn’t lying there naturally; a simple Magic
        Circle had been drawn around her to allow the surrounding prana to flow
        in. Although this location was not above a leyline, there was still
        leftover prana gathered here from when Caster had greedily devoured the
        souls of those he had sacrificed. Putting aside whether this supply made
        her comfortable, it was enough to stabilize her condition.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, it would have been easy if he were to simply cut open her
        abdomen now and take out the ‘Vessel of the Grail’. However, Kirei
        wished for a chance to speak with her. That was why he was wasting his
        effort to provide her with prana.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Can you hear me, woman?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The homunculus opened her eyes, breathing faintly. Her empty gaze was
        without focus and her eyesight had evidently diminished, but she still
        recognized the voice of her nemesis.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Kotomine… Kirei. Like I thought, you’re the one…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The victor of the Heaven’s Feel is about to be decided. Perhaps I will
        be the one to complete the ancient wish of your Einsbern house.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was not confident enough to declare absolute victory, such a
        conclusion was a conservative estimate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You still have an attitude and are so uncooperative. Are you so
        displeased with me?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Of course… There’s only one person I will entrust the Holy Grail to…
        and that would never be you, Executor.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although she found it difficult even to speak, the hatred and power in
        her voice made Kirei furrow his brows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I don’t understand. You’re nothing but a doll that carries the Holy
        Grail. The completion of the ceremony should be your only concern,
        rather than who may win the war. Why are you so bent on certain Masters
        in your current condition?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Yes, how could you possibly understand?... You’re the kind of person
        who doesn’t even have a wish to bestow upon the Holy Grail.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The loathing mockery made Kirei even more baffled &ndash; was this woman
        really just a homunculus? Why did a homunculus, which didn’t even have a
        soul, possess such emotions?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Kotomine Kirei… you’re an empty man who doesn’t even understand the
        meaning of battle. You’ll never win against that man… Be prepared; my
        knight, my husband will surely destroy you…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Why are you talking about me?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What made Kirei more baffled was the content of her words. How could
        this homunculus look into his heart with such accuracy? Tokiomi could
        not do that, nor could his own father or wife.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hah, scared? Fine, I’ll tell you… Emiya Kiritsugu has seen through you.
        He is alarmed by you and therefore regards you as the greatest enemy …
        Kiritsugu will fall upon you in a way more cruel and merciless than
        anyone else. Be prepared…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        So that was why &ndash; Kirei nodded with satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it was that man &ndash; if those who could understand Kirei truly
        existed &ndash; then that man must be the same kind of person as Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Emiya Kiritsugu did not let him down. Though the two of them had never
        met, he had nevertheless made the most appropriate evaluation of
        Kotomine Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Thank you, woman. That is a blessing for me. The man Emiya Kiritsugu is
        truly just as I had imagined.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, a bout of mocking laughter answered Kirei.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… You’re such a foolish man. You’re saying you understand Emiya
        Kiritsugu? … Hmph, don’t make me laugh. You aren’t even up to his heel
        in worth.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; What did you say?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sudden sound made his entire body shiver. He could not forget that
        sentence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “True… Emiya Kiritsugu can see through you, but you’ll never see through
        him… Kotomine Kirei, you don’t have any of the things that man has in
        his soul.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei grasped her slender neck before more mocking words could flow out
        of her throat. The rage and confusion swirling within Kirei’s heart at
        that moment was incomparable to what he had felt back in the Einsbern
        Forest even if the fatal battle there was to be repeated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… I admit it. True, I’m an empty man. I have nothing.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His roaring seemed to be calm at the beginning, or maybe traces of
        agitation only surfaced later on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But what’s the difference between Kiritsugu and me? Between me and that
        man who only devoted himself to senseless war &ndash; a man who never
        got anything out of it but only repeated his slaughter?! He departed so
        much from common sense and he got absolutely nothing. What is he, if not
        a lost soul!?!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kirei rebuked her desperately and hoarsely.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His inquiry was like the angry roar of an anguished soul that could not
        obtain the answer it sought even after having experienced every kind of
        trial imaginable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Homunculus, answer me if you can. Why does Emiya Kiritsugu seek the
        Holy Grail? What is the wish that man bestowed upon the all-powerful
        wish-granting vessel!?!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if provoking her, Kirei loosened his hands, which were grasped around
        the homunculus’s neck, and permitted her to breathe so she could answer
        him. There was an unspoken warning that if he received a vague answer,
        he would end her breathing forever.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even so, this woman did not express even a sliver of terror. Kneeling
        before Kirei’s knees, she weakly gasped for oxygen in such a pitiful
        manner. But the look that she gave Kirei still contained the derision
        and superiority reserved for the victor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">It was almost as if Kirei was the one kneeling.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Alright, I’ll tell you &ndash; Emiya Kiritsugu’s lasting hope is to
        save humanity. It is to end all wars and bloodshed and achieve eternal
        world peace.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That only seemed like jestful nonsense for Kirei. After a few seconds,
        he burst out laughing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; What was that?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You can’t understand it. That is the difference between you and him.
        You believe in nothing while he does.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Was this woman really talking about the man Emiya Kiritsugu? Kirei had
        doubts. What kind of man did Emiya Kiritsugu pretend to be while in
        front of this woman?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Woman, what are you to Emiya Kiritsugu?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I gave birth to his child as his wife. I’ve looked into his heart and
        shared his worries for the past nine years… unlike you, who has never
        seen him.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nine years. Perhaps he had passed such a long time in a lie? Kirei had
        such doubts, but he instinctively felt it would be impossible. What
        existed in this woman’s heart was undoubtedly her trust toward Emiya
        Kiritsugu. It would be unimaginable to form such a strong personality
        within her if she based it on an empty lie. This woman was originally
        only an ordinary homunculus after all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The focus of his anger began to shift away from this woman before her.
        Kirei gave out a melancholic sigh and sat down onto the chair next to
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Irisviel von Einsbern, were you always a good wife in those nine years?
        Did you win Emiya Kiritsugu’s love?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… Why do you care?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I don’t understand the bond between you two &ndash; you took pride in
        having Emiya Kiritsugu as your husband and trust him as if you’re a real
        couple. However, if Emiya Kiritsugu is a man who seeks the Holy Grail,
        you should have been just a tool with which to fulfill his wish. He has
        no reason to give you something as unnecessary as love.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… I won’t forgive you if you laugh at him for being stupid.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those were the decisive words spoken by one who had something that could
        not be violated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… I have no parents, and I’m not a product of love. Therefore, I can’t
        understand what a ‘good wife’ is. Even so… the love he gave me is my
        entire world. No one can humiliate that.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Then, Irisviel, you’re a perfect wife.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei said as if making a disinterested judgement. It was not praise,
        nor was it sarcasm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “But I can’t understand Emiya Kiritsugu because of that. Since he loves
        you as a wife, then why… why would he want eternal world peace? Why
        would he sacrifice his loved one for such a pointless aspiration?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… Such an odd question. For you, a man who has admitted that he has no
        reason for existence… You’re mocking others and saying their aspirations
        are meaningless?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Any sensible adult would have laughed at him.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was an anger completely different from before. Kirei’s heart
        swelled up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Combat is instinctive of humanity. Eliminating it is no different from
        eliminating humans. What else could be more pointless? This so-called
        aspiration of Emiya Kiritsugu’s &ndash; it shouldn’t have been called an
        aspiration to begin with, but the dream of a child!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… That is why he could only rely on a miracle…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Irisviel tried her best to keep her cool and continued speaking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “He lost everything for the aspiration he sought… He always suffered
        through his punishments for wanting to save those that could not be
        saved, and everything around him was robbed… I am also someone taken
        away from him. He has been forced to discard his loved ones many times…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei stood up from his chair and gazed at Irisviel with a bottomless
        and gloomy look.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You’re saying it’s not just limited to this once &ndash; but that this
        is the way of existence for this man?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Yes. Kiritsugu is far too gentle. He doesn’t hold back on his love even
        though he knows he will lose those around him sooner or later…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those answers were enough for Kirei. He completely lost interest in the
        homunculus before him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… I understand.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He grasped the woman’s neck with his strong fingertips and stopped her
        blood flow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the other’s weak and painful expression, Kirei calmly said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I finally understand. So this is Emiya Kiritsugu.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei threw the woman, who had already fainted, to one side, and gazed
        emptily into the darkness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In retrospect, Kirei had been wrong since the start&ndash; his question
        was answered, but his anticipation became disappointment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Emiya Kiritsugu was not looking for the truth amongst meaningless
        repetition.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That man had simply consigned all meaningful things into nothingness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It wasn’t that he had no wishes, but that he had such a ridiculous wish
        that he fell into a cycle of nothingness. His futile efforts and what he
        had wasted was so foolish that it was unsalvageable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps Kiritsugu could see through Kotomine Kirei’s empty heart, and
        perhaps he would fear that emptiness and be alarmed. However, he would
        never be able to imagine the meaning of having such an emptiness. He
        could never hope to understand the fervent desire that Kirei harbored.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Emiya Kiritsugu’s life could be concluded as having repeatedly discarded
        everything.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The joy and happiness that man had discarded &ndash; even its fragments
        were important enough in Kirei’s eyes for him to protect with his life
        or even die for.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For a man like Kirei who continued to be lost and could not find a
        single piece of such joy and happiness, Kiritsugu’s life only existed in
        his dreams and his admiration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His insatiable thirst and unrecoverable loss had been belittled and
        mocked in such a way &ndash; how could he endure this? How could he not
        hate this?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The dark feelings swelling up in his heart twisted Kirei’s smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">He finally understood the meaning of this war.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had absolutely no interest in the Holy Grail. It did not matter if he
        had no thoughts of fulfilling a wish.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But if he could break the dreams of this man, who had gambled everything
        upon this miracle, with his own hands &ndash; then even the Holy Grail,
        which was completely meaningless to him, had a use in being obtained.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The excitement of approaching battle made Kirei’s hands tremor. The
        rising desire of battle burned in his heart, as if he were about to take
        out his Black Keys right then and pierce through everything in front of
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the darkness muddied by the stench of blood, Kotomine Kirei laughed
        out loud. It was something that had never ceased in all these long years
        - the throbbing of his soul.
