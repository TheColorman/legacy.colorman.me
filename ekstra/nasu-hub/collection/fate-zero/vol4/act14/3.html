      <h2 id="calibre_link-12" class="calibre2">-36:44:26</h2>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From a building far away, three pairs of eyes watched Rider’s flying
        Noble Phantasm as it appeared in the airspace above Shinto city, as well
        as Saber as she changed her route to pursue him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One person’s eyes expressed satisfaction. One pair of eyes was extremely
        fatigued. And one more person &mdash;could those eyes, filled with
        violent frenzy, still be said to belong to a human?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I did not think that the real Rider would actually appear… This is
        truly a good show. Matou Kariya, you often bring luck to your companions
        on the battlefield.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kotomine Kirei said this with a smile, in a tone that held a slight
        insinuation of sarcasm. At the same time, he slapped Kariya’s shoulder
        to indicate admiration. Kariya's good right eye regarded him with
        suspicion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Father… do you think it is worth wasting two Command Spells on such a
        small matter?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya looked at his right hand, which was missing two Command Spells,
        with some dissatisfaction. Kirei said to him, smiling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “There is no need to worry. Kariya, as long as you are willing to help
        me, you need not worry about wasting Command Spells&mdash;come, stretch
        out your hand.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei caught hold of Kariya’s veined and withered right hand, softly
        chanting a Holy Word while tracing the mark of the Command Spells with
        his own hand. At his small ministration, the darkened Command Spells
        immediately regained their light and returned to the previous shape of
        three marks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“You… really&mdash;“</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Did I not already tell you? Kariya. I accepted the duty of Supervisor,
        so I have the right to redistribute the Command Spells in safekeeping of
        the Church at will.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya was unable to surmise the other’s true intentions; he regarded
        Kirei unabashedly, then glanced with a sigh at his own Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The large silhouette standing behind him was Rider, King of Conquerors,
        Alexander. Whether it was the crimson mantle or the curly red hair, or
        the burly physique&mdash;everything was the same as the driver of the
        chariot that had sped out of Fuyuki City with Saber. The only difference
        was the pair of eerie, blood-red eyes radiating resentment… Undoubtedly,
        this was a characteristic unique to a Mad Enhanced Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wrapped in his thickset arms was the slender body of Irisviel, who had
        lost consciousness and was still in a coma. This ‘Rider’ was the true
        culprit who had kidnapped the ‘Guardian of the Holy Grail’ from the
        underground storage that Maiya protected, and had also lured Saber to
        give chase toward Shinto.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… That is enough, Berserker.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya nodded. The large body of the King of Conquerors turned into a
        pitch-black fog as if burnt, then reverted to the armored figure filled
        with an ominous air. The dark energy that imitated Rider’s appearance
        twined about his hands and legs, obscuring small parts of the black
        armor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing Berserker returned to his original form, Kirei said as if
        groaning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This sort of transformation ability… It is truly wasted as a Noble
        Phantasm of Berserker’s level.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This guy initially had the ability to transform into many other Heroic
        Spirits that had won merit in military exploits for other people.
        Because of the Mad Enhancement, it has been reduced to the ability of
        ‘imitation’.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The black fog that twined about Berserker’s entire body was originally a
        Noble Phantasm that had the purpose of not only hiding his visage, but
        also of mimicking any person in order to deceive enemies’ ears and eyes.
        Ever since Berserker had been stripped of his rationality, this ability
        could not be brought into play. Kariya had forced this ability to
        manifest through the power of the Command Spells and made it possible to
        disguise Berserker as a fake Rider. But this ability could only be used
        once.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ar… ur…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Berserker stared after the light of Saber’s motorcycle headlights moving
        gradually further away into the east, his gaze full of hatred. A
        bone-deep hatred caused his shoulders to shake ceaselessly, the armor
        chafing with a creaking sound, but he did not do anything else out of
        the ordinary. That was due to the binding of the ultimate command, the
        second Command Spell that Kariya had used&mdash;“capture Irisviel, and
        let Saber escape”.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In order to make Berserker, who had an unusual stubbornness when it came
        to Saber, follow his own instruction, it was necessary to restrict him
        with a forceful command.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For Berserker, it appeared that those shackles were extremely difficult
        to endure. Although his task was now complete, the black knight seemed
        like a mechanical part that had malfunctioned; his limbs continuously
        convulsed, stubbornly resisting this command.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya felt a chill run down his back at Berserker’s willfulness. As
        Berserker fell into a state of uncontrollability, Kariya forcefully cut
        off the prana connection with him. Having lost the prana that sustained
        his form in this world, the Servant immediately reverted to spirit form
        and the body of Irisviel, losing its support, was violently thrown to
        the rooftop floor. On impact, the sleeping homunculus gave a soft groan
        of pain, but nevertheless did not open her eyes. Since being forcefully
        kidnapped from the Magic Circle in which she had rested, Irisviel’s
        awareness had become even thinner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Is this woman really the ‘Vessel of the Holy Grail’?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “To be precise, it is this homunculus. If one or two more Servants are
        finished, then it will probably show its true form… I will prepare the
        ritual to receive the Grail as it descends. Until that time, let this
        woman also be temporarily under my protection.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The robed man picked up the weak body of the woman; Kariya wordlessly
        communicated his question with his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kirei noticed his gaze and replied as before, with a leisurely and
        self-satisfied smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Don’t worry. I will give you the Grail as per our agreement. Because I
        have no need to pursue that wish-granting machine.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Before that, you seem to also have promised me another thing, Father.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Ah, that thing… Of course there is no problem. You just have to come to
        the church at midnight tonight. I will make the preparation for you to
        meet Tohsaka Tokiomi then.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Exactly what did this priest intend? &mdash; It made Kariya’s heart very
        troubled to not be able to discern his true intention all this time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though Kotomine Kirei had once been a disciple under Tohsaka Tokiomi,
        for the sake of participating in the Heaven’s Feel he had split ways and
        become a Master&mdash;a hypocrite. But from the perspective of the Matou
        family that had also participated in the previous Heaven’s Feel, the
        collusion between the Tohsaka house and the Church had long been known.
        In this case, it was also obvious without needing to be said that this
        son of the Supervisor, who was also an Executor of the Church, had
        summoned Assassin as Tokiomi’s lackey.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At noon today, Kirei had actually come running all of a sudden to knock
        on the door of the Matou house, saying that he hoped to discuss the
        establishment an alliance. According to him, the responsibility for
        Supervisor Kotomine Risei’s death fell on Tohsaka; as the man’s son it
        was necessary for him to avenge his father, and so he wished to use the
        hand of the Matous to kill Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Kariya knew that this intention was suspicious, the conditions
        laid out by Kotomine Kirei were truly too alluring to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This man had not only planned to trap Tokiomi, but also investigated the
        location in which Einzbern, protector of the ‘Vessel of the Grail’, was
        hiding and secretly succeeded the right to safekeep the Command Spells
        as Supervisor; it could be said that he held the most important trump
        card to the latter half of the Heaven’s Feel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To Kariya, holding the ticking time bomb known as Berserker, isolated
        and unable to trust even his own kin, Kirei’s assistance was greater
        than an army of thousands; his heart was immediately grounded. However,
        the condition was that he had to trust everything that this man Kotomine
        Kirei said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kotomine Kirei could ensure that the homunculus of the Einzbern family
        was in his hands. He even generously replenished his consumed Command
        Spells… But even thus, Kariya was unable to completely trust this priest
        whose smile surfaced as leisurely and self-satisfied.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The attitude of this man was truly too relaxed. Perhaps it was due to
        the confidence brought about by the secret he held, which was the most
        important deciding factor. But if he were only to look at it thus
        simply&mdash;that indicated that he had no sense of danger in the face
        of battle, or a sense of anxiety in needing to consider tactics.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it were absolutely necessary to describe, that smile was closer to
        that of an excited child playing a game. In the name of betraying his
        benefactor to avenge his father, this man had formed an alliance with
        him. It was very obvious that this man found great joy in this sort of
        situation…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “It will be too suspicious if both of us appear at the same time.
        Kariya, why don’t you go back first?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… And you?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “I still have some small things to do… Don’t forget, Kariya. Tonight at
        midnight, your wish shall be accomplished there.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The priest seemed to be even more concerned over the whole affair than
        Kariya himself, reminding Kariya again in a voice filled with
        anticipation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya once again regarded his smile with a suspicious gaze, then slowly
        turned around and walked toward the rooftop staircase.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without the slightest carelessness, Kotomine Kirei listened closely to
        his ally’s footsteps moving into the distance. After confirming that the
        sound of footsteps had entirely disappeared&mdash;he again moved to a
        corner of the rooftop and shifted his gaze to a pile of discarded
        material covered by many sheets of water-resistant material.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… I have already sent him away. I don’t know who you are, but isn’t it
        about time you revealed yourself?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This voice carried an authority that did not permit compromise. After a
        period of silence, a hair-raising and suppressed laughter rang out,
        seeping into the icy night air.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Oh, already noticed, have you? Indeed, you are worthy of being an
        Executor who has experienced battle. Much more sensitive than that kid
        Kariya."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the darkness appeared a shadow without definite form. At first
        glance Kirei had even thought that it was a large pile of worms, a
        collection that would send a chill through anyone&mdash;but the bright
        moonlight immediately chased away this misconception; it was an old man,
        thin and small of stature, that quietly walked out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Executor, you have no need to worry. I am not your enemy. I am the kin
        of that kid who is cooperating with you.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since he named himself thus&mdash;in Kirei’s heart surfaced a suitable
        person.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Matou Zōken… is it not?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Indeed. You even know my name. It seems that Tohsaka instructs his
        disciples well.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The old magus quirked a corner of the lips deeply hidden in wrinkles,
        revealing an inhuman smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <center class="calibre5">※※※※※</center>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The thickness of the darkness spread about the mountain road was already
        incomparable to that of evening; it seemed that it was already night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the darkness that was black as ink, you would not see your hand in
        front of your face. The brilliance of the headlights ripped apart this
        patch of darkness. Saber was still driving the steel beast as if her
        life depended on it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She had traveled this path when escorting Einzbern out of the city. When
        they had left, it had been Irisviel driving; returning, it was Saber who
        tightly gripped the steering wheel of the Mercedes-Benz, sure of the
        road. Though it was only two times that they had come and gone, it was
        enough for Saber. Her memory was above average; be it the width of the
        road or the angle of inclination or even when to make a turn, she could
        clearly recall it all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber saw that Rider’s ‘Gordius Wheel’ had only just descended from high
        in the air and landed somewhere far away. For some unknown reason, the
        King of Conquerors had not continued to flee, but had landed on the
        ground, seemingly intending to respond to Saber’s challenge of having a
        competition of riding skills on the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His air of heroism seemed not to be miscible with his sneak tactic of
        kidnapping Irisviel, but perhaps this was exactly the conflict between
        Rider and his Master. The actions of Servants restricted by the contract
        often brought about many contradictory results; this was not surprising.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was exactly the personal experience that Saber herself had gained
        through her conflict with Emiya Kiritsugu.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It made Saber very happy that Rider could make a decision based on his
        own agenda in this final battleground. Between these two fast-moving
        riders, Kiritsugu had no way of interfering even if he wanted to. To
        Saber, this was something she wanted very much.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The key of the problem lay somewhere else&mdash;the vibration of the
        handlebars she was tightly gripping sent a message of danger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As a man-made machine, the V-MAX had already fully manifested all of its
        ability. What was sad was that what was driving ahead was a quick-moving
        Noble Phantasm that transcended normality. Although the V-MAX was
        already being towed along by its rider Saber’s internal prana, the
        strength of its material composition and structure was definitely
        limited.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The engine and acceleration system, which from the city to here had been
        continuously used to their greatest capacity, were already showing signs
        of breaking down. Saber’s excellent driving allowed her to be aware of
        this vehicle’s internal situation as well as she would have known an
        extension of her own physical body. It was already possible to clearly
        hear the dejected cry of almost having reached its limit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“It’ll be terrible if this goes on…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There would be nothing more to say if she were to decelerate in
        consideration of the vehicle’s burden, but if it were necessary to force
        the motorcycle to continue at its high speed, this vehicle would fall
        apart within a few minutes. If no measures were taken to strengthen the
        innate capability of the vehicle…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber herself had difficulty judging the feasibility of the plan that
        had momentarily flashed into her mind, but there was no way to hesitate
        further. Saber made up her mind and entrusted everything to all the
        possibilities that had been given to her as a Servant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The full-body platinum armor that she wore while fighting&mdash; she now
        intended not to put the armor on her own body, but to fuse it with the
        body of the V-MAX through intense psychokinesis. The concept was similar
        to the armor that protected beloved horses on the battlefield. With the
        sense of unity of riding as the mainstay, this time she must definitely
        turn this steel beast that could not speak into her own limbs…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Her prana continuously being released, the various important parts of
        the V-MAX that could ensure maximum speed of movement were completely
        covered and protected; the flexible and strong armor increased the
        capability of the motorcycle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&mdash;This is great!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though this usage was unexpected, Saber’s great skill made this
        difficult task possible. The entire structure of the V-MAX was wrapped
        in brand-new silver armor, beautiful and majestic to behold. This hard
        structure of the vehicle was in no way inferior to that monstrous,
        extraordinarily strong horsepower; this time, the mechanical lion had
        finally become a real magical beast. The exhaust pipe thundered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber released the Invisible Air like an arrow directly in front of her,
        completely covering the body of the vehicle. Using the compression of
        the pneumatic umbrella to decrease air resistance to zero, the V-MAX was
        finally released from air resistance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The needle of the speedometer was already damaged and could not be used.
        Saber’s prana had caused the rushing vehicle to transcend the laws of
        physics; already the speed was more than 400 kilometers per hour. The
        pressure released by the magecraft pressed the rear wheel firmly against
        the cement; even when making turns, Saber did not release the throttle
        and turned the body of the vehicle round by force.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like this, it might even be possible&mdash; it made Saber extremely
        excited to have captured this thread of victory through so much effort.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The distance from the ‘Gordius Wheel’ in front gradually shortened.
        Originally it had looked like only a point of light, but now it was
        already possible to clearly see the entire likeness of the thundering
        vehicle that was releasing lightning bolts and also turning at high
        speeds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, Waver, who had been sitting in the charioteer’s seat
        since having touched down, was constantly watching the rear. Seeing the
        brilliance from the headlights of the motorcycle that was suddenly
        approaching, he could not help but hold his breath; he tugged at Rider’s
        cape.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Rider, at this rate they will catch up to us! Eh, idiot, look out
        behind!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing Waver’s frantic voice, Rider snorted. As a Heroic Spirit who had
        appeared in this world and gained the throne of Rider, even without
        turning back he could clearly feel the presence of Saber gradually
        closing in.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “This fellow, Saber. On the account that she can catch up just using
        that gizmo, I cannot but praise her. On the other hand…”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider roared, the corner of his lips twisting, showing the smile that
        had always seemed somewhat sinister.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Sorry, but this is a war chariot. Now I can no longer play nicely in
        this game of competing speeds with you!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then Rider slid the enormous structure of the car to the side, arriving
        at the side of the road.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the two sides of ‘Gordius Wheel’ whose dimensions were greater than
        an ordinary truck were fixed two large, fiercely curved sickles. On the
        two sides of the national highway on which Rider was now speeding were
        dense forests that almost covered the path. If the wheels of the chariot
        were moved to the very edge of the paved road, then the blade of the
        sickle would definitely pass into the lush green forest&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“So, Saber, pursue me from behind!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The electrified wheels of the chariot crushed the forest as easily as if
        it were cutting through paper; Rider had begun a brutal deforestation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Though the tree trunks were all very thick, for the sharp sickles flying
        at 400 kilometers an hour, it was as easy as sawing wood. The tree
        trunks that had been instantaneously broken all snapped back and were
        swept into the air. The sight was like shredding wood shavings, only it
        was a nightmare a few hundred times more majestic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this tremendous scene of destruction, Saber could not help but
        hold her breath.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Damn it…!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The trees that had been swept up into the air descended like rain upon
        their target, which was obviously the head of Saber who was catching up
        from behind. To say nothing of being directly hit&mdash;at this speed,
        even if the steering wheel should be gently brushed across, it would be
        a matter of life and death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Deceleration&mdash;was impossible. This was not a test that could be
        avoided just by retreating. The only path of survival was to rush on
        forward.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber made up her mind; after making thorough mental preparation, she
        rushed into the rain of continuously falling trees without any timidity
        whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These things fell toward the ground like an avalanche. The V-MAX
        advanced forward in a twisting manner like a snake, passing through
        narrow spaces. Saber thought that braking to make the motorcycle stop
        was an act of stupidity, so not only did she not decelerate, she also
        made use of the momentum from acceleration to make the front wheel leave
        the ground, relying only on the rear wheel to maintain balance and
        performing the consummate stunt of controlling the driving of a
        motorcycle using magecraft alone. That beautiful one-wheeled dance
        incited Waver to stare, completely forgetting his fear; on Rider’s face
        also appeared a very satisfied smile.

        “Hahahahaha! Fabulous! Indeed the King of Knights of consummate dignity!
        Only you are worthy to be named flower of the battlefield!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Laughing, Rider continued to deftly slide the chariot from side to side,
        closing in on the next object to be cut down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Here I come again&mdash;next up after the trees is a rain of stones!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next prey of the sickles was surprisingly the solid asphalt and
        concrete that covered the surface of the road. Rock had a density and
        hardness much greater than tree trunks. But the sickles nevertheless
        mercilessly crushed them to rubble, sending them flying in all
        directions like droplets, blocking Saber’s way.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A fatal baptism of rocks much more lethal than tree trunks. But&mdash;
        Saber stared ahead, moving forward bravely, the corners of her mouth
        suddenly showing an undefeatable smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“King of Conquerors, you underestimate me!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rocks were more dangerous than tree trunks only when first assuming that
        they must ‘hit’. If she could dodge it all, then it would make no
        difference even if it were raining rockets or bullets. Saber entrusted
        the last hope of victory to the V-MAX which she completely trusted,
        using valiant and yet beautifully skilled riding ability to pass through
        the gaps between the stone and concrete.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, sweeping the surface of the road with its large
        sickles, Rider’s war chariot had already lost its ability to accelerate.
        The concrete was much more difficult to cut through than tree trunks and
        was an obstructing force to the divine bulls, one that could not be
        overlooked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber’s sixth sense predicted the arrival of a divine opportunity for
        victory. From then on, the priority was to pass through the next few
        successive tests safe and unharmed; there would definitely be a chance
        to rise again from death&mdash; A large concrete slab that had broken
        off the surface of the road obstructed the path of the V-MAX. The large
        flat stone slab, measuring more than two meters in both length and
        breadth, was just like a stone screen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing the blocked path right ahead of her, Saber’s gaze was unwavering;
        driving the V-MAX forward, she raised Invisible Air over the edge.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Chaaaaaarge!!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Along with her roar, the clump of air pressure&mdash;which had the
        momentum to sweep away an army of thousands and was supported by the
        release of prana &ndash; impacted heavily on the top of the stone slab;
        the slab, which looked as if it must weigh at least several tons, was
        easily flung into the air. It completely defied the laws of physics that
        the slender wrist of a young girl could carry out such a grand feat;
        this was the godly skill transcending normalcy that only a Servant could
        possess.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Spinning rapidly in midair, the stone slab fell forward along the fatal
        parabola, aligned exactly with the top of the war chariot in front.
        Hearing Waver’s terrible scream, Rider turned his head. Raising his
        sword, he stared wide-eyed at the rock over his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“AAAAAAAAAH!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if saying ‘In a competition of strength I will definitely not lose to
        you’, Rider boldly brandished the bronze sword level with the stone
        slab. The slab’s trajectory was once again changed, spinning even more
        wildly in midair. At last it fell down like a boomerang, embedding
        itself deeply in the surface of the road behind the chariot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this scene, Saber’s entire body was electrified by a revelation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The concrete slab embedded into the asphalt road surface&mdash;the
        smooth side facing the sky, it was embedded diagonally into the ground
        at an angle of slightly more than thirty degrees. It was like a key that
        foretold the presence of victory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Now is a good time&mdash;“</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under the thumb of her right hand, which was tightly gripping the
        steering wheel, was a button that she had always been acutely conscious
        of. Saber drove the V-MAX with extraordinary riding skill; though she
        did not know that button’s ‘function’, she did know that button’s
        ‘effect’. That was the deepest secret hidden within this horse of steel,
        and also the most powerful trump card.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without the slightest hesitation, Saber pressed down on the red button;
        the two-wheeled beast let out a provoked roar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        Within the interior of the rapidly rotating engine, inside the valve
        that had switched to atomization mode and filled with oxide fuel, the
        nitrogenous oxide expanded under the high temperature of 300 degrees
        Celsius and reached the boundaries of its limit. The V-MAX, suddenly
        increasing acceleration twofold, sped forward; this could only be called
        rapid acceleration. Saber used a great deal of strength to control the
        body of the vehicle; her target was a slope that had just appeared
        before her eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The front wheel had already moved onto the concrete slab which was
        giving out creaking sounds resembling screams. Then the body of the
        vehicle was propelled upward; the force of the madly spinning rear wheel
        suspended it in the air. Even the restriction of gravity had been
        broken, as it flew high into the air&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To Rider, this was definitely a surprise attack that he had not
        anticipated. Complacently flying his Noble Phantasm in midair, he had
        not at all expected that the enemy would appear right above his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Taking advantage of the lapse as the chariot slowed, due to a great
        acceleration from the V-MAX’s turbocharger, as well as having made a
        springboard of the slope that had come about only through coincidence,
        Saber found Rider’s weak spot at last.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And this position above the enemy’s head was one of absolute advantage
        in crossing blades. This was indeed the grace of the goddess of victory
        given to the sword-wielding Heroic Spirit; this time was a chance of
        certain victory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Die, Rider!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Invisible Air, which had been lifted as if she gambled everything with
        this one blow &mdash; slowed slightly with hesitation at that time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider raised his own blade to block. The blades that clashed
        together&mdash;considering only power, Saber should have had a greater
        chance of victory due to the advantage of her position; however, the
        outcome was an even match. Invisible Air could not break past Rider’s
        defenses, and had at last been deflected away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was no opportunity for the swords to clash again, not between
        Gordius Wheel and the V-MAX which had fallen. Saber let off the speed
        that had been increased by the instantaneous prana release, sustaining
        the balance of the vehicle in midair only with great difficulty; as the
        rear wheel touched the ground, all the force of impact was absorbed by
        the rubber tire and suspension.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus was an excellent opportunity to seize victory lost in vain, but
        Saber’s unease was for another reason.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Einzbern is not here?!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was no mistake. In the instant that the V-MAX had leaped, she had
        seen that in the charioteer’s seat of Gordius Wheel, aside from the
        driver Rider there was only his Master.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In that case, then where had Irisviel, who had been kidnapped from the
        underground storage, gone?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber braked with all her strength, restraining the vehicle that weighed
        more than 300 kilograms. The tires skidded on the surface of the ground,
        stopping the violent revolutions of the two wheels. All this time, she
        had pursued Rider without the slightest hesitation, but now the clouds
        of doubt surfaced in her chest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Exactly where was Rider’s destination as he moved?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the city street he had moved east to pass through the national
        highway… His final destination was the Einzbern forest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider had already walked this path once, holding a bottle of wine. After
        kidnapping Irisviel, why would he specifically choose an escape route
        that led to the enemy’s territory?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Feeling a chill that made her restless, Saber gritted her teeth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">What if this was not an escape?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And how would the Master of Rider have known about the underground
        cellar at Miyama&mdash;yes, it was basically impossible for him to have
        known. Rider’s camp had not in fact known that the Einzberns had changed
        their location. He had definitely thought that Saber and the rest had
        still been in that forested citadel, and so had, in the middle of the
        night, driven his chariot in midair in a blind rush there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In that case, then who was it that had attacked Maiya and kidnapped
        Irisviel in the underground storage?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The truth was still unclear, but now an intense premonition rushed forth
        into Saber’s heart that she had been tricked. That feeling made her
        restless. While Saber had been pursuit Rider, the culprit that had set
        Rider up might be fleeing with Irisviel even now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She could not stay here any longer. She needed to return to Shinto as
        quickly as possible to search for Irisviel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And yet&mdash;though this judgment was entirely accurate, Saber did not
        move. There was a tense aura about her body, like the rising wind that
        heralds a coming storm; no useless action was allowed. She gazed upon
        the danger before her eyes, taking her stance and preparing to go all
        out at any time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        About a hundred meters away, Rider’s chariot also slowed to a stop. And
        it had reversed the direction that it was facing, too. All this time, it
        had moved straight forward to let Saber trail in its dust, but now it
        actually turned around; the eyes of the two divine bulls, as well as
        their master the King of Conquerors, were filled with a feeling of the
        joy of battle; he looked upon Saber with a captivating gaze.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was no need to guess. Rider’s intentions were very
        obvious&mdash;he intended to fight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From his eyes could not be seen the slightest shadow of deception or
        scheming; he had truly been set up. The fires of rage burned in the eyes
        of the King of Conquerors as if demonstrating his might and saying ‘No
        matter how you may stab me, I will return it in equal measure’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Rider had moved east because he had the intention to challenge Saber,
        then his situation was different from that of Saber who had been led
        into a trap; he was in no way opposed to the current situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Precisely because of this, if she were to ignore the problem of Rider
        and return to Fuyuki City, this would mean that she would be victim to
        Rider’s attack from behind while she was completely unprepared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She could only make an immediate decision now&mdash;it was a moment with
        no room to choose, in which she must quickly make her choice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The small hands of hers that gripped the hilt of her sword suddenly gave
        out a creaking sound.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver huddled on the charioteer’s seat of the Gordius Wheel; he could
        feel that the fighting spirit of Rider, who stood beside him, had
        already reached its peak.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The target of the King of Conquerors was definitely ahead of him by a
        hundred or so meters: Saber, riding on the large motorcycle, staring in
        this direction with a serious expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She had chased Rider fervently from Shinto till here; why would she
        suddenly stop now? But Rider, upon seeing that his pursuer had stopped,
        did not take the opportunity to flee and widen the distance, but instead
        immediately turned the chariot around and pull it to a halt, as if
        intending to have a face-to-face confrontation. It stood to reason that
        this was a matter of course. Because to have a showdown with Saber had
        been Rider’s intention from the start. If the other had given up the
        pursuit, then it would be necessary for this side to take the
        initiative.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But&mdash;although Waver was not yet very mature, he still bore the
        burden of being a Master; feeling restless and uneasy, he could not help
        but bite his lip.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This distance, and this position, was all terrible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber’s Noble Phantasm, which had taken the life of Caster at Mion
        River&mdash;ever since witnessing the ‘Sword of Promised Victory’, the
        war situation in front of him was clear at a glance. This was a straight
        road that was not obstructed by anything. There was no worry that
        unrelated people could be affected. Both sides were still as they stared
        at each other&mdash;without a doubt, the current situation was a
        uniquely advantageous condition for Saber’s Noble Phantasm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Small things of this magnitude would not have gone unnoticed by war
        veteran Rider. He had also witnessed the might of Saber’s Noble Phantasm
        at Mion River. Although his judgment was more often based on emotion
        than reason, in matters of war strategy, this Servant would definitely
        not judge wrongly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If, at this moment, the mechanical energy of the Gordius Wheel had been
        manifested at the largest capacity possible, perhaps it would have even
        been possible to evade for a time. But for some unknown reason, Rider
        just had to abandon the advantage he had in leg power and choose instead
        to confront Saber directly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Hey, Rider…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Nn. Even if it is to you, my Master, I must first make this clear.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As if seeing through Waver’s doubt, Rider surfaced an irrepressible
        smile; nevertheless, his gaze never shifted from Saber as he said to the
        youth beside him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “From now on, I will put aside my thoughts of winning the Grail; I
        intend to raise the stakes. If you wish to use a Command Spell to stop
        me, then perhaps now is the time?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because he knew the haughty personality of this Servant, he could
        understand his intention.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A rational Master would definitely use the power of the Command Spell to
        stop him; the Servant himself knew this well, too, but he wished to act
        recklessly anyway. Was this the case?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You… are you really going to initiate the attack? From this angle? Rush
        straight over?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “That sword of light that we saw at the riverside. When Saber has taken
        her stance and is preparing to use it, we shall see if my Gordius Wheel
        can use the time lapse to cross this distance. This is what we are
        contesting.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver’s expression changed drastically; he began to recalculate the
        distance between both sides.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It would be just in time; this was so alarmingly dangerous.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Comparing the time he remembered it would take Saber to activate her
        Noble Phantasm and the acceleration power of Rider’s Noble Phantasm...
        No matter what angle he looked at it, it was very difficult to guess at
        the final result. The distance across which the two confronted each
        other was really very opportune.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“… How sure are you of victory? Rider?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“About half.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Conquerors replied with a dignified air, in a tone that was
        nevertheless very relaxed. To one who managed military affairs, this
        statistic was not in fact very optimistic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the chance of victory was half, then the chance of failure was also
        half. It was as absurd as flipping a coin to decide between life and
        death. This sort of thing was definitely not worth being called a
        ‘strategy’. If one absolutely had to name it something, then it could
        only be called ‘the stratagem of gambling with one’s life’. Only under
        conditions in which there was no other way out would one adopt such
        foolish action.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Why do you want to… act irresponsibly like this?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Precisely because it is acting irresponsibly, therefore.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Servant said softly, showing a somewhat sinister smile; his eyes
        were filled with the belief in victory&mdash; while gazing fixedly upon
        an uncertain future of which he was only fifty percent assured.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If a challenge is made under conditions like this when both sides are
        evenly matched, then the side that loses will definitely be left with no
        excuses or face. This is the true ‘ultimate defeat’. I don’t actually
        think that that the sword of that girl who’s always trying to show off
        her cleverness can use this opportunity to bring me down. If I can
        completely defeat her in this way, then perhaps this time she will feel
        fear at her own incompetence, and from then on become my subordinate and
        serve me.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver furrowed his brow; he could only sigh. There were truly no words
        that could be said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the end, it was only thus. Compared to the war centered around the
        Holy Grail, they placed even greater importance on the open and
        aboveboard competition between themselves as Heroic Spirits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…You... want to win against Saber so much that you are willing to do
        something like this?“
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Mn, indeed, I would like that very much.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider nodded his head without the slightest hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “On the battlefield, she is certainly a star on earth. Rather than
        letting her make those jokes about whether or not she is actually an
        ideal king, it is better that she emit true light as a subordinate under
        me.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This despot had defeated countless nobility and war generals; ignoring
        their power and wealth, he had obtained their ‘souls’.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was for this reason that people called him the King of Conquerors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not eliminate the enemy, nor belittle them; he subdued a standing
        opponent&mdash;this was what he thought was the true form of victory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What right had one who relied only on the Grail to connect and establish
        a contract to be concerned with whether this was right or wrong?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “… Forget it, Rider. If you can win by your methods, then that’s okay
        too.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver had given up; exhaling frustratedly, he threw out such a sentence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was not a case of sending the helve after the hatchet. To Rider,
        whose prana had been replenished through a day of rest, this was an
        excellent opportunity to make a challenge; it was an opportunity that
        would definitely not come again. No one could guarantee that the next
        time he confronted Saber, his physical condition would be better than
        this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In that case, instead of believing in a statistical chance of victory,
        it was better to place his bet on Rider’s fighting spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to attempting to convince the King of Conquerors through
        logical reasoning, it was better to let him do things on his own
        grounds&mdash;it was precisely that transcendent personality that was
        afraid of neither heaven nor earth that perhaps formed a chance of
        victory one could believe in.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver’s expression was serious, as if having said these many reasons in
        order to convince himself. Rider maintained a confident smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hehe, kid, you seem to be starting to understand this idea of
        ‘supremacy’.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His confidence was not hollow. Though he had said that it was a large
        gamble, Rider himself had full confidence in his victory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Light is at the other end of the world&mdash;conquer! Via Expugnatio:
        Distant Trampling Domination!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The true name of that which had finally been released, the chariot drawn
        by divine bulls from which lightning suddenly burst forth. The majestic
        braying of the divine bulls under whose feet Berserker had been trampled
        in the first battle could never compare to this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&mdash;Let the wind come!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing her opponent rush towards her, Saber also hurriedly pulled out
        her sword under the protection of the air pressure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Opening the vortex of the hurricane, a golden light shone forth as if to
        show the kingship of the knight; prana was continuously roiling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“AAAALaLaLaLaLaie&nbsp;!!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Accompanying Rider’s roar, the bulls stamped hard once on the asphalt
        ground; their cloven hooves rushed forward like raging billows. Waver,
        though overwhelmed by their majesty, nevertheless made an utmost effort
        to open his eyes wide, so as not to pass out again like the last time.
        At the fore was a very strong anti-city Noble Phantasm about to be
        released; in order to gain the initiative, Rider rushed as if his life
        depended on it, definitely unwilling to give up an opportunity to defeat
        Saber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Conquerors’ direct attack sent a shiver down Saber’s spine.
        By the rushing of the divine bulls, the hundred-meter distance had
        instantaneously been decreased to zero. In the blink of an eye, the
        might of Gordius Wheel manifested before her eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the hilt of her precious sword had still been in her hand, then she
        would definitely have been certain of victory; facing the golden
        radiance that Rider raised, there was only one thing that she could
        shout out, one true name.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ex&mdash;“</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the moment that the rushing incarnation of thunder was about to
        trample upon Saber’s small frame&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Calibur!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Golden lightning, as if radiating countless comets, made the night as
        bright as day.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&mdash;!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver’s gaze was drawn by this, dazzled by this, and he could not help
        but turn around&mdash;within the intense attack, he rationalized
        extremely calmly and realized one thing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had personally witnessed the light of Saber’s Noble Phantasm, and
        that meant… the result was that, before the Gordius Wheel had reached
        its final step, the King of Knights had taken the first step to initiate
        her attack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But even thus, the touch of the thickset arm that extended all the way
        to his shoulder nevertheless did not disappear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To be aware of one’s own defeat at the same time indicated the truth
        that one was still alive and clearheadedly conscious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waver gingerly opened his eyes and saw the appalling condition of the
        battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to Excalibur's blow, the surface of the road had instantly been
        burned away; even the forest a little way away had been instantly blown
        to waste. The road was scarred, carved in the likeness of a single
        straight line. The molten asphalt gave off a revolting stench; it was
        extremely pungent. Waver felt as if his body was floating through the
        universe… no, carried by a strong man on his shoulders. Who was it that
        carried his young Master like a small luggage bag&mdash; it was not
        necessary to ask to know.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ah… we’ve failed.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rider said softly, as if remorseful from the heart. But considering the
        current situation, it did seem like too much of an understatement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It appeared that Rider was not hurt, either. But the chariot in which he
        rode, as well as the two divine bulls, had all vanished without a trace.
        The Noble Phantasm ‘Gordius Wheel’ had borne the might of the ‘Sword of
        Promised Victory’ and so had, like Caster’s sea monster, vanished and
        left no trace, not even a speck of dust.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the moment at which he had bordered the line of death, Rider, who had
        understood his failure, had quickly plucked Waver from the charioteer’s
        seat and narrowly escaped from under the attack of the anti-city Noble
        Phantasm. It could really be said that the two had cheated death. But
        the price was high enough. The flying chariot, which Rider had used as
        his main weapon all this time, had at the last minute gone up in smoke.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But this was not yet over&mdash;using his will to fight, Waver
        immediately chased away his frustration at failure. Even if the ‘Gordius
        Wheel’ had been taken away, the King of Conquerors still had one last
        real trump card.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Rider! Use ‘Ionian Hetairoi’&mdash;“</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Toward Waver who spoke thus, Rider lightly but very firmly shook his
        head. The King of Conquerors seemed to not yet intend to dismiss his
        foresight regarding the latter half of the war, which he had come up
        with while resting. If Saber was his opponent, it was best to use the
        chariot. As for the summoning of the Hetairoi, which could only be
        activated once, it was necessary to save it for the showdown with Archer
        later.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But no matter how physically strong and unwilling to admit defeat Rider
        was, to engage in a battle of blades without mechanical force was
        clearly a definitively advantageous position for Saber. Though the build
        of the two were vastly different, this was a battle between Servants
        that transcended normalcy. Though Saber looked weak, she had a monstrous
        fighting ability; from the battles so far, Waver had long since become
        aware of this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very obviously, Rider understood her strength well. But the King of
        Conquerors still did not look at all afraid; he confronted Saber open
        and aboveboard by raising his sword, without the slightest indication of
        retreat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In this closely matched staring competition, it was Saber who lost
        first.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She slid the sword wrapped in windstorms back into its sheath, then
        released the throttle and slid the rear wheel around to turn the
        vehicle, speeding away with her back to Rider.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Saber did not show off her weakness to Rider at all; at the same time
        she was moving the rear wheel, she also quickly accelerated, leaving
        behind only a tremendous roar of exhaust and moving quickly in the
        direction of Fuyuki City in one breath.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To Waver and Rider, this was certainly unexpected; now Saber needed to
        quickly search for Irisviel and had no time for a showdown with Rider.
        She needed to find the culprit who had led her to clash with Rider, then
        snatch Irisviel back from that person; for this goal, even if she had to
        throw aside the showdown with Rider, she needed to retreat as soon as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the blink of an eye she had disappeared from sight, leaving only the
        roar of a motorcycle that was moving away. Waver and Rider stood there
        stupefied, listening to the sound of the motorcycle. Rider, who had been
        listening intensely to the sound of the exhaust, nodded, showing a
        knowing expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“A motorcycle… Nn, it is truly a good thing.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “&mdash;You&mdash;after being defeated, this is really the first thing
        you have to say?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the aftermath of battle, all the strength had drained out of Waver’s
        body; angrily questioning Rider, he suddenly became aware of an
        important problem and became dismayed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “Hey, Rider&mdash;how are we ever going to get back?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ah, that… We shall have to walk.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&mdash;Yeah.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the darkness, Waver gazed upon Shinto which shone with light in the
        distance, and sighed heavily.
