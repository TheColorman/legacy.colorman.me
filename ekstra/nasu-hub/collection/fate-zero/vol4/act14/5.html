      <h2 id="calibre_link-14" class="calibre2">-30:02:45</h2>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was midnight, but a bright light was still on in the hilltop church.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The house of God that promised peace on earth &ndash; as he came upon
        it, a small yet contradictory sentiment stopped Matō Kariya in his
        tracks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The naivety of those humans who easily sought solace at the so-called
        place of prayer. He sneered at the thought; but at the same time, one
        could not help but feel sympathy towards them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If one said that every suffering in this world was but a trial of God,
        then Kariya would strangle that God and His disciples to death with his
        own hands &ndash; he was probably driven by that impulsion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One step, and then another. Steadily, Kariya was getting closer to the
        Holy Grail. But even faster, the crest worms inside his body kept eating
        into his life. If he strained his ears, he could almost hear the
        trilling sound of the worms slurping flesh and blood from his body, the
        sound of them scraping his bones and feasting on them. To Kariya, the
        pain of the crest worms’ slow, continual torture had already become a
        part of himself, like breath and heartbeat. His consciousness was always
        cloudy and dim, and if he lost focus he would be only vaguely aware of
        the passage of time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He swore never to forgive him as a person. Like water seeping out of a
        crevice, that thought continued to erode his heart bit by bit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre6">How many more times can I fight later?</i>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre6">How many more days will I live?</i>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Kariya was trying to gain the Holy Grail and secure Sakura’s
        salvation with his own hands &ndash; which was exactly his last wish -
        he could only wait for a miracle, right?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If that was the case, should he pray? From the top of the towering gable
        roof in front of him, at that cross with its detached gaze, the worms
        creeping towards the ground; should he kneel down and pray earnestly?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Stop kidding… me… ugh!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He felt like he was being flooded by a humiliating timidity. Scoldingly,
        Kariya rebuked himself. He did not come to the church at a time like
        this to seek imaginary help. No, it was the exact opposite. This
        evening, Kariya sought the blood of his sworn enemy. If he was to
        believe Kotomine Kirei’s words, then at this moment, the one awaiting
        Kariya’s visit at the chapel was none other than Tōsaka Tokiomi. He was
        not here for repentance or worship &ndash; Kariya was standing in front
        of the altar now to conclude a vendetta. Kotomine Kirei had prepared an
        unlikely rematch for his previous duel with Tokiomi, the one he had
        lost. Tonight would probably be his last chance to get back at that
        loathsome magus. He must not be careless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The pain of his flesh, conflict and despair &ndash; all were burned down
        to ashes by the flames of hatred that flared up in his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Memories of the previous battle &ndash; he had not even returned a
        single attack &ndash; further fanned the fury within Kariya.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His mind could only see the instant in which he would destroy Tokiomi
        &ndash; who had snatched Aoi away from him and abandoned Sakura &ndash;
        with his own hands. With only that in mind &ndash; how near he was to
        the Holy Grail; the terror of being defeated &ndash; all was forgotten.
        He had completely turned into an automatic, hate-driven machine. With
        only that in mind, Matō Kariya’s heart was liberated from all
        sufferings. His mouth even curved into a smile. There was no longer any
        fear of letting Berserker loose. With that, he would grab Tokiomi’s
        heart, and he would bathe in the gush of his blood. If he could achieve
        that, there was nothing he could not afford to lose &ndash; he was
        reduced to such thinking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His shoulders shook like a beast drawing a deep breath. Having arrived
        at the front gate of the church with killing intent seething from his
        entire body, Kariya slowly pushed the doors open.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <br class="calibre4" />
        A candlelight glimmered gently in the center of the chapel. In contrast,
        the still air was overly peaceful, as if it had frozen. Kariya felt a
        slight sense of unease, like one would feel in a graveyard.
        Nevertheless, the instant he saw the back of the head of the person
        sitting in the first row of the congregation seats, he was awash with
        overwhelming anger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Tōsaka, Tokiomi…!!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a shout brimming with killing intent, but there was no reply.
        Knowing that complete disregard was just like the prideful attitude of
        the magus, Kariya walked in on large strides and closed his distance
        with Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You want to kill me, Tokiomi? But you’re too naïve. Until I have my
        revenge on you, no matter how many times, I will……”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But with his defenseless back exposed to Kariya, Tokiomi still did not
        show any response. Despite himself, Kariya slowed his pace with distrust
        and caution.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He wondered if it was a decoy puppet sitting there to trick Kariya.
        However, from up close he could see the shoulder width, the carefully
        trimmed, curly and glossy hair, and even the shape of his slightly
        visible ears &ndash; without a doubt, this was Tōsaka. Kariya would not
        be mistaken about the figure of his sworn enemy, which had been burned
        into his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya came to a distance where could reach out and touch Tokiomi with
        his hands, and stopped.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With hatred and an odd unease and confusion, he gazed at the back of
        Tokiomi, who had not budged an inch.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Tōsaka &ndash;“</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He stretched out his hand.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The day before yesterday, defensive fire had stopped all his attacks.
        Recalling the scorching heat, he instinctively drew his hand back. Even
        so, he could not resist the impulse to grab Tokiomi’s neck, just a few
        centimeters away, and break it… Finally, the shivering fingertip reached
        the front of the neck with its stylish tie.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With just a light touch, the corpse that had been leaning against the
        seat lost its balance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The flaccid limbs were like those of a puppet whose strings had been
        cut. Like building blocks tumbling down, Tōsaka Tokiomi’s ice-cold body
        collapsed into Kariya’s arms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash;“</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that moment, the confusion and shock that hit Matō Kariya was as
        destructive as a single hammer blow to his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like an empty shell, the blank face was unmistakable &ndash; without any
        room for doubt, it was the countenance of Tōsaka Tokiomi. At that point,
        Kariya had no other choice but to accept that Tokiomi was dead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The once scornful, haughty derision, all the intimately cold-hearted and
        sneering words; all the memories related to Tōsaka Tokiomi saturated
        Kariya’s thoughts and overwhelmed him. With the existence of Tokiomi as
        a starting point, the sentiments, motivation, and urge swirling within
        Kariya, were all blown off at once.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“W &ndash; W &ndash; Why….?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        And then, standing with the soundless corpse in his hands,
        thunderstruck, Kariya was stunned at the size of the hole gaping wide
        within it. A cavity so large that it caused Matō Kariya’s countenance to
        crumble to an unrecognizable appearance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that moment, for the first time, he realized that he had not
        considered, much less foreseen losing his driving factor &ndash; his
        bitter enemy, Tōsaka Tokiomi; but this realization was already too late.
        Uncontrollably shaken, Kariya was at a point where he could not even
        recall basic information like why he had been fighting Tokiomi or what
        had he wished for in participating in the war of the Holy Grail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">And then &ndash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……Kariya...-kun?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &ndash; At that moment, until he sensed the presence of the new visitor
        who had just stepped into the chapel, until he was called from behind by
        that familiar and lovely voice &ndash; Kariya had not noticed anything
        at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Turning back in a stupor, Kariya could not grasp at all why Aoi Tōsaka
        was still standing there. If his brain had been functioning properly, he
        probably would have wondered why he was being called by Aoi of all
        people, and why she had visited this place when there was no reason at
        all for her to do so. And he probably could have gone even further back
        in his train of thought to the one person who would have been able to
        position Tokiomi’s body at the chapel beforehand &ndash; it had to be a
        human - and been able to guess without difficulty the identity of the
        person who had killed Tokiomi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“A….u…..”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at the height of his confusion, in a state where he could not
        mouth legible words, Kariya could only moan uselessly. The instant he
        staggered back, the corpse he had been carrying in his arms fell onto
        the chapel floor with like a sack. Thud. For a long time, Aoi stared at
        the figure that had once been her husband. Staring, without twitching a
        muscle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Aoi...-san…… I……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without uttering a syllable, Aoi slowly approached Tokiomi’s body as if
        being drawn to him. For reasons unknown, Kariya felt overpowered and
        retreated further, but was obstructed by an obstacle just a few steps
        later. Rigidly still as if passing judgment unto him, it was the altar
        of the chapel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bending her knees to the floor, Aoi lifted Tokiomi’s face up. With no
        place to hide, Kariya could only watch her. He could not understand why
        Aoi did such a thing. &ndash; No, he did not want to understand. Why she
        did not even spare a glance at him, her childhood friend, but
        continually fixed her eyes on the body of Tokiomi; what the meaning of
        those tears falling down her face was &ndash; Kariya obstinately
        rejected comprehension, and because of that, he could not utter a single
        word.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If memory served &ndash; he was supposed to never make this person
        &ndash; whom he loved above anyone else &ndash; cry again, and to fight
        for her even at the cost of his life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If that was the case, then this woman sobbing in front of him right now
        &ndash; who was she? If he were to accept the answer, wouldn’t Matō
        Kariya fall to pieces?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She did not look at Kariya. As if ignoring the air and all else, tears
        poured out from her to her husband’s body. She, the tragic heroine, was
        exactly at the center of the world as its axis of revolution. Having
        regarded her in that way, Kariya was an existence devoid of all meaning,
        like trash on the stage or a stain in the background. Kariya was
        terrified of the delusion that his position and his very existence were
        erased. He even felt the impulse to scream to catch her attention. But
        not a sound could come out of his dry throat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nevertheless, before long, when he was looked straight in the eye by Aoi
        &ndash; who had finally lifted her head up &ndash; Kariya finally
        understood: Ignorance was a greater compassion; if he could disappear
        from the world at that instant, it would be a far greater relief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “……So now it’s as if the Matōs had gained the Holy Grail, right? Happy
        now, Kariya-kun?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a familiar voice, but in a tone he had never heard before. That
        was because his gentle and kind childhood friend had never hated or
        cursed anyone in front of Kariya before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I &ndash; but, I &ndash; “</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Why must he be blamed? Tokiomi Tōsaka was the cause of all the evil.
        When that man was not around, everything was supposed to turn out well.
        First of all, why had he died in a place like this? It should have been
        Kariya asking questions instead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Why…..?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, not even allowing time for Kariya to reply, she asked him back
        instead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “So after snatching Sakura away from me, the Matōs are still not
        satisfied? Of all people, you killed this man in front of my own eyes……
        Why? Did you really hate us so much?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre6">I don’t know I don’t know.</i>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a face just like Aoi's; with a voice just like Aoi's; why was this
        woman directing such seething enmity and cold killing intent towards
        Matō Kariya?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kariya was supposed to have saved Aoi. He was supposed to have obtained
        a future for her beloved daughter. Then why was he being blamed? Who on
        earth was this woman?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“That guy &ndash; it’s his, fault &ndash; “</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Pointing at Tokiomi’s corpse with a shaky hand, Kariya tried to correct
        Aoi in a loud voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “If that man would just, disappear &ndash; no misfortune would befall on
        anyone. Aoi-san, Sakura-chan &ndash; I thought you’d be, happy &ndash;“
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Stop talking nonsense!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">With a demonic expression, the woman shouted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “You, what do you know! Someone who has
        <i class="calibre6">never loved anyone before</i>!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“&ndash; Ah &ndash;“</p>
      <p class="calibre3">With a snap &ndash;</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        &ndash; the decisive cracking sound caused Matō Kariya to collapse.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“I…”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre6">I have a person I loved.</i>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre6"
          >Someone warm and gentle; someone whom I want to be happy, above
          everyone else.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre6"
          >If it’s for her sake, even my life was worth it. Because I felt this
          way, I had to, endure,

        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“For me…… the person…… I love ……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While murmuring with a scraping sound, Kariya’s fists tightened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In order to heap denials upon those words that denied his everything; in
        order to shut her mouth up, he tightly squeezed her throat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The woman opened and closed her mouth, gasping for oxygen like a fish
        that had left its tank &ndash; and yet it seemed to Kariya as if she was
        trying to form words to further abuse him, which infuriated him all the
        more.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        <i class="calibre6"
          >If I don’t shut her up, everything will end. Everything I’ve done to
          this day will be meaningless. There’s no way I can allow that to
          happen.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As a matter of fact, Matō Kariya’s madness was the last fortress left to
        rescue him. In spite of that, he had even missed that lowliest aid at
        the last moment &ndash; the face of the woman rapidly turning deathly
        pale due to lack of oxygen was too similar to the image of the beloved
        woman he cherished so much in his heart &ndash; no, it was the very
        woman herself. At last, Kariya realized that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……Ah.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the instant both hands loosened up, a sound slipped from Aoi’s mouth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Collapsing onto the ground with a thud, she had fainted, not budging an
        inch. Lacking even the sound judgment to differentiate the living from
        the dead, Kariya thought that just like Tokiomi, she had died.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“Ah, ah……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He gazed at the hands that had just choked Aoi with all their might.
        Someone more important than anything else; someone who was the very
        meaning of his life &ndash; those fingers that had plucked that someone
        away stiffened like they belonged to someone else. But without a doubt,
        there was no way to deceive himself &ndash; those fingers belonged to
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like a peal of thunder, he realized. Those fingers squirming so shakily
        were just like the crest worms creeping about Sakura’s skin.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“AaaaaAAAaaaaaAAAAAAhhhhHHHHHHhhhHH…!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He clawed at his broken face.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He tore his dried-up hair.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A scream escaped his throat. Whether it was a shriek or a wail, he could
        not even understand that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Losing the last bit of sense in him, with only his animalistic instinct,
        Kariya desperately sought to flee; stumbling, he ran away from the
        chapel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man who had lost everything was greeted by the pitch-black darkness
        of the starless night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">

        Within the chapel of Fuyuki Church, there were secrets known only to the
        priest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The wall that separated the chapel and the priest’s room in the back in
        reality only served as a partition. It was built with the consideration
        that all the writings in the chapel went through the priest’s room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, as he relaxed in a chair of the priest’s room, Kotomine Kirei
        could hear every development of the tragedy in detail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He seemed deeply immersed in his thoughts. Beside him, the golden
        Servant watching over him asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “A foolish, worthless play. Oh well, not too bad for the first script
        you wrote. &ndash; How was it Kirei? Your views?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Silently gazing into space, Kirei gulped down wine from a glass he was
        holding.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a mysterious sensation. The plot was just as he imagined and
        expected &ndash; it was performed and recreated relying on human beings
        in flesh and blood, furnished with souls.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was no surprise at all. Both Matō Kariya and Tōsaka Aoi had
        accepted the roles Kirei conveyed to them; and at the appointed time,
        they had visited the church and encountered each other with the perfect
        timing. He had not expected Tokiomi’s body &ndash; which was just a
        stage prop &ndash; to have the exact effect he desired. Because he had
        rectified the death spots and the stiffened post-mortem body,
        theoretically, no one should have been able to perceive that the person
        had been dead for more than half a day.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But if it was a development that betrayed none of his expectations -
        even if there were supposed to be no surprises &ndash; when he watched
        over it to the end, he felt a peculiar excitement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it was to be named, it might be called a sense of “freshness”.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The tragic scene just now was not a fantasy performed by actors. It was
        true that Kirei had guided the scene. But baring their innermost
        feelings, his fellow humans clashed against one another &ndash; the
        radiance of souls scattering the sparks was, without a doubt, authentic.
        While struggling to decide on an answer to Gilgamesh’s question, Kirei
        tasted the fragrance of the wine in his mouth again. Indeed, if it was
        surprise he was looking for, he was better off looking into this wine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “…… Why, I drank this before, and yet…… I did not notice how profound
        the taste of this wine was."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The King of Heroes smiled at Kirei who gazed at his wine glass,
        straight-faced.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        “The taste of a wine is disguised in unexpected forms depending on the
        side dish served alongside it. Looks like you have begun to understand
        the meaning of the phrase, ‘broaden one’s view’.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">“……”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not knowing the best way to reply to the rapturous Gilgamesh, Kirei put
        down his empty glass and stood up. He thought about the things he was
        supposed to attend to later and felt that he could not afford to keep
        relaxing. Aoi, lying on the chapel floor, would undoubtedly require
        treatment. And he also had to retrieve the fleeing Kariya for his next
        course of action.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nevertheless, before leaving the room, Kirei once again glanced at the
        empty glass. He noticed that he felt reluctant to part with the wine,
        which he had finally finished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Earnestly, he thought &ndash;
        <i class="calibre6"
          >if I can taste such flavor from this wine, I would love to drink it
          again.</i
        >
