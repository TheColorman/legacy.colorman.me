      <p>Autumn still arrived.</p>
      <br />
      <p>It caused people to want to return to their warm sleep.</p>
      <br />
      <p>It dyed the all the leaves in the forest red.</p>

        Despite the idea of being a tearful child away from civilization, even a
        girl dormitory life would be enjoyable, we are Reien Girls Academy. It
        was also tailored fit for the cute young ladies (us) as the ‘Since you
        are here, you will only be a winner if you are a rare creature’, a place
        that was filled with excitement and romantic weather-independent
        motorized fortress. Even though there were countless cruelties that was
        described in this book, only 10% of what was written happened in
        reality, so to all of the juniors you have nothing to worry about.

        Time flies and I will soon be participating in the 3rd cultural festival
        after entering high school.

        This series was supposed to be published without following a schedule,
        instead it was published as a separate issue as part of a last gift. The
        magazine has always been arranging the works of the seven most
        unexpected stories collected from different classes and clubs, but this
        time it’s about the things the author myself had experienced, as well as
        my friends, that were mostly rendered, which are just fictional stories.
        How much was it was real or created, it is up to you who is going to
        spend your time at Reien to find out the answers. Beware, if you were to
        stay at Natsumi Hall, never stay with 8 people at the same time. If you
        were to obey this rule, I promise that all of you will experience an
        indescribable night.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p></p>
      <br />
      <p>So. The latter is some gossip.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The time in Reien that I thought since I first entered that will last
        forever will come to an end.
      </p>

        It has been 6 years since the beginning. The sentimental teenage time, I
        had spent it all on this academy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It was still alright even though there wasn’t much freedom, no matter
        the friends that I can only meet here, no matter the nuns I admire, all
        these will become very distant to me. Even if we were to gather again,
        the times where everyone was happy in this isolated academy will never
        come back again.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p></p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The me right now felt really sad, and at the same time really proud.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I finally experienced, the feeling that the previous senpais had
        experienced, the end of our youth.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This will not be recorded down anywhere, it was a part of me, the last
        pain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>This is also a kind of World End.</p>
      <br />
      <p>No matter if there were tears or happiness, the end will come.</p>
      <br />
      <p></p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the end, the world will still move on, so I didn’t have the time to
        close my eyes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        No matter how many things were to leave, we will still admonish
        ourselves to go with the flow, and to prepare for the next stage; in the
        future if you encounter another person, please tell him/her the end that
        you had experienced. Although there are most that will forgot about it,
        there are some that will remember it in their hearts.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p></p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Many things, even in the past, if left alone will strongly hinder me in
        the next scene, if it is fortune that we met by chance, I wished to
        listen to your fun stories of the end that you saw at that moment.
        Anyhow, if you forgotten it immediately,even if I am alone, I might meet
        people who can remember forever.

        Finally, I would like to mention Chairperson of Literature Club
        Tamaki-san for given me this opportunity to write this book, roommate
        Miss A assisted me until the very last minute, friends willingly gave
        permission to use episodes, miss F as proof reader, and I will not
        forget the winter during high school first year, I want to thank M
        senpai that gave me warm coffee when I was trembling while holding a pen
        in the female toilet.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p></p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This book is dedicated to me, those girls, and the girl that is still
        revolving till now. [TL: See notes below]

        The last line still boggles the two of us. Here is the Japanese line:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        本書はわたしと、彼女たちと、今も回り続けている彼女にあてたものである
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        回り normally means spinning, but it confuses us to imagine a girl
        spinning. Anyone can help us on this?
