      1/Original Sin<br />
      <br />
      So after I came back home from work, I saw an angel in my room holding a
      guitar.<br />
      ...I guess I've finally gone insane.<br />
      Long, blond, wavy hair and a pure white one-piece dress.<br />
      A face that left hints of girlish youth and... a ring of light floating on
      top of her head?<br />
      If this wasn't an angel, I sure as hell didn't know what one was supposed
      to be.<br />
      <br />
      "Good evening." <br />
      The Angel bowed with an awkward smile.<br />
      <br />
      After rubbing my eyes, I walked inside. The Angel kept standing in the
      middle of the room holding the guitar, and for some reason was looking at
      me excitedly.<br />
      <br />
      "Ok, who the hell are you?"<br />
      <br />
      "I'm an angel," she laughed with a smile.<br />
      <br />
      "Yeah, I can tell. What I meant was, why are you in my room? If you're
      here to sell yourself, you came to the wrong room. I hate to break it to
      you, but I'm not making enough cash to buy an angel."<br />
      <br />
      "Um, I'm not here for that. Um, what's the best way of putting it? I'd
      like to do your housework."<br />
      <br />
      "I can do that by myself. Get out."<br />
      <br />
      " Now, I just can't do that. You see, I can do anything!"<br />
      Since she was full of confidence, I let her clean the place up. The
      result: a scene far more gruesome than a tragedy.<br />
      <br />
      "...Um, my cooking's perfect" the angel said, quickly sticking her index
      finger up.<br />
      <br />
      "No thanks. I can't take factory produced food. It has too much nutrition
      and the veins will rupture. You get what I'm saying?"<br />
      <br />
      The Angel nodded. Seems like she at least knew that I was a human not part
      of the A-Ray species.<br />
      <br />
      "Ok. So what else can you do?"<br />
      <br />
      "I can play the guitar!" she said happily, stroking the guitar.<br />
      <br />
      Her blue guitar was one of the types that used electricity to produce
      sound.<br />
      It wasn't the kind of merchandise that went well with angels.<br />
      And not just that. She just plain sucked.<br />
      <br />
      "Get out."<br />
      I took the Angel's hands and kicked her out from the window.<br />
      <br />
      Days passed and I went to the hospital. <br />
      "There is nothing wrong with your brain," answered a fish-faced doctor.
      <br />
      <br />
      And so, everyday after finishing work, I wasted energy chasing away that
      Angel. <br />
      Eventually, I gave up bothering to.<br />
      <br />
      "The sky, it's dark," the Angel muttered as she looked out at the sky from
      the window.<br />
      <br />
      An Angel that didn't even know that <br />
      Figures. She didn't seem to be one of the artificial angels included in
      the A-Rays. <br />
      "Hey. Where'd you come from? I'm guessing you're not an A-Ray on this side
      of the rift."<br />
      <br />
      "I'm not an A-Ray."<br />
      Then what are you?<br />
      "I'm a being that was created from the hopes and dreams of the people
      living in this city.<br />
      That's why I'm so pretty. I'm glad that everyone had such pure souls."<br />
      The angel twirled around happily.<br />
      The edge of her skirt wavered like a dress.<br />
      <br />
      Now that she mentioned it, she seemed unreal. The angel was too beautiful
      to be an inhabitant of the Land of Steel.<br />
      Her golden hair was so dazzling, that instead it projected poison.<br />
      So that means...she's an illusion that only I could see?<br />
      <br />
      "Erm, so why is the manifestation of everybody's imagination in my
      room?"<br />
      <br />
      "Because it's you who killed me!"<br />
      <br />
      She seem to be mad that I didn't realize that, more so than the fact that
      I "killed" her.<br />
      When I asked her if she came here to get revenge, she answered back,
      "What's revenge?"<br />
      <br />
      The angel turned out to be pretty handy and learned many things gradually.
      Now she apparently grasped what it means to clean.The only exception was
      anything involving the guitar.<br />
      <br />
      "I'm not improving with the guitar at all. I'm playing it just like I'm
      imaging it, but what I'm thinking and what's coming out are completely
      different."<br />
      <br />
      Ah, so there was a song she wanted to play. Of course, she wouldn't get
      any better.<br />
      <br />
      "No shit. That guitar hasn't been tuned."<br />
      Yep. It was screwed up from the beginning.<br />
      <br />
      The Angel tilted her head and asked, "What's tuning?"<br />
      <br />
