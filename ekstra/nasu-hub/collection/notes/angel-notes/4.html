      <br />
      Slipping through the busy streets of the city, I returned to my room.<br />
      <br />
      The Angel was stubbornly still there.<br />
      <br />
      It's winter soon. The temperature would break the critical freezing
      point and the city would soon literally freeze.<br />
      <br />
      But I didn't think of passing my second winter in this city.<br />
      <br />
      "There's a lot of commotion in the city lately."<br />
      <br />
      The Angel said that as she looked down from the window.<br />
      <br />
      The large window, larger than the Angel, looked like a window of a
      church that I once saw in a picture book.<br />
      <br />
      The Angel with blond hair and bright white wings bent over with a sad
      face. Behind her, the city and two World Trees were blurry like a
      mirage.<br />
      <br />
      ...Everything was inside a world in steel color. Only this Angel was
      pretty as if it was a nightmare.<br />
      <br />
      The Angel looked down at the distant ground.<br />
      <br />
      The city was packed with people who were trying to leave.<br />
      <br />
      "Um. What is everyone doing?"<br />
      <br />
      "They are moving out all together. The neighboring area was destroyed by
      a three thousand meter Aristoteles. Calculating its progressing route,
      they said it will pass through this city in three days."<br />
      <br />
      "Above, me?"<br />
      <br />
      "Above us. It might collide with the World Tree. Either way, everything
      in its path is destroyed. It's obvious why people are running away"<br />
      <br />
      "Oh, so that's why everyone's so desperate"<br />
      <br />
      The Angel said that as she looked down vacantly. <br />
      <br />
      Glancing at the Angel who's just standing there, I started packing my
      belongings. I pushed winter equipments and clothing, personal air maker,
      and several guns into my bag. I decided to leave everything else
      behind.<br />
      <br />
      "Are you going too?"<br />
      <br />
      "Yeah, because I don't want to die. But not right away. I'll go out on
      my own after the commotion down there dies down."<br />
      <br />
      The Angle sadly lowered her eyes. Because she was always happy for no
      reason, just that made her look really lonely.<br />
      <br />
      "...This may be the last time, so let me you ask you a question. What
      were you after all?"<br />
      <br />
      The Angel made a sigh without any seriousness.<br />
      <br />
      I can only make out that she wasn't the existing species of angels.<br />
      That's why----- I wanted to know the truth, at least in the end.<br />
      <br />
      A plain reply of the Angel.<br />
      "What everyone calls the Aristoteles"<br />
      You didn't know? The Angel looked at me like that.<br />
      <br />
      Aristoteles. A thing that suddenly appeared on this planet and became an
      enemy of all living things. An unpredictable enemy where not only was
      there no method of communication, their biological structure as a living
      thing was unclear.<br />
      <br />
      And that was, at a little city like this, in a room of a deserted tower,
      shaped like an angel, and playing a guitar? What kind of joke was that?
      ...No living things on this planet was able to stand up against this
      life form, what a punishment by God.<br />
      <br />
      "Really? You?"<br />
      <br />
      "Oh no, the thing at the base of this city to be exact. What I was, was
      shot down and fell to this place. It was an instant death. Trees grew
      and people started living on top of that."<br />
      <br />
      The Angel goes on. This planet has no longer any power to raise life.
      That's why greens wouldn't grow, but if it was on top of another life
      instead of the earth, they would.<br />
      <br />
      "I'm normally not that kind of thing, but I ended up like this. What
      everyone calls the World Trees are the wings of what used to be me.
      ...umm in other words, feathers of the wings. The falling feathers took
      shape of what I used to look like. I was originally that kind of
      invading life form. It's not the angels that were originally on this
      planet."<br />
      <br />
      "But you're still shaped like an angel"<br />
      <br />
      "Because I am everyone's fantasy. The body of what I used to be died
      already, but it seems something like the mind was still alive. But a
      concept of a mind never existed to me. The species of this planet have a
      wonderful ability to form a shape out of knowledge. Using everyone as a
      model, I formed a shape out of my knowledge that I had but never
      used.<br />
      The reason I'm shaped like an angel is because it's the closest image of
      the shape of what I used to be. That's how I was able to communicate
      with everyone by creating the same thought circuit. I was able to become
      myself by taking form of the imaginary angel."<br />
      The Angel detached herself from a thing called Aristoteles by becoming
      an illusion. She was able to acknowledge herself for the first time by
      becoming something not herself.<br />
      ....She's already noone, but a manifestation of an angel that the people
      imagined on their own.<br />
      <br />
      "Are you, happy?"<br />
      <br />
      The Angel happily replied, yes.<br />
      <br />
      Only an illusion stood here.<br />
      <br />
      "-----I see, an angel can only live within an imagination."<br />
      I happened to recall the definition of an angel.<br />
      That it had wings, an halo, being really beautiful, and then, it's only
      an illusion-----<br />
      After all, a thing that brings you hope, can only be an fantasy.<br />
      <br />
      When I thought about that, the angel sadly replied, you're right.<br />
      <br />
      -------------------------------<br />
      <br />
      "I wish I was a real angel"<br />
      With an appearance that looked more like an angel than an actual angel,
      she said something like that. <br />
