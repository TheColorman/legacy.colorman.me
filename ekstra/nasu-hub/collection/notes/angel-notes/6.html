      6 / Glitter Love<br />
      <br />
      Just when I was about to leave the city, I got caught by a messenger of
      the military. Someone must have remembered an old story from 5 years ago
      and enlisted me in this mission.<br />
      <br />
      When I returned to my room to pick up the Black Barrel that I left to rot,
      the Angel was still there.<br />
      <br />
      "Are you going to fight that?"<br />
      <br />
      "Looks like it. The Knights are assembling too, and the military's eager
      to do it. They're aiming to at least change the Cross's course. If that's
      it, then the possibility isn't zero"<br />
      <br />
      "It's impossible. Everyone doesn't understand what an Aristoteles is. That
      isn't a life form on this planet. There is no, chance of winning."<br />
      <br />
      "How could that be? In reality, we have already defeated 3 Aristoteles. If
      we have more fire power than them, it's not an unstoppable opponent"<br />
      <br />
      "I don't know about that. They can't be judged by this planet's common
      sense. That's why even a concept of death doesn't exist for them. They
      won't stop until they achieved their objective."<br />
      <br />
      "Objective? You guys had such thing?"<br />
      <br />
      "Yes. It's not our own objective but we do. They arrived here to fulfill
      the wish of this planet. ...This planet died by the influence of the life
      forms that lived on it. The planet itself doesn't have a feeling of grief.
      Even perishing by the influence of its own life forms is "All right". A
      planet only carries a will; it carries no meaning. "<br />
      But there was an exception. The planet is able to forgive it because the
      life forms follow the same fate as the planet. But the human species were
      able to live on, even on the dead land. This planet was frightened by the
      existence that kept on living on top of its death, and cried out for help
      at its end. Please, wipe out the life forms that are still alive."<br />
      <br />
      "...I see. So that's who you guys were"<br />
      <br />
      When I muttered that, the Angel said no, as she shook her head.<br />
      <br />
      "The only ones who were able to hear the cry of the planet, were also
      planets. I, no, we were the highest ranking species of those planets who
      received the will of this planet. For example, The Aristoteles that was
      called the Heaven's Corpse... what I used to be, was the most superior
      individual on Venus."<br />
      <br />
      "Wha...t?'<br />
      <br />
      Without knowing, I lost my breath. Our enemy were species that ruled over
      the alien branches of another planet, where our common sense doesn't
      apply. The strongest life form on a planet, was in other words, the planet
      itself. The human species who survived on this planet, to put it simple,
      were fighting 8 planets.<br />
      <br />
      "---Yeah, there's no chance of winning. You got that right"<br />
      <br />
      Yes, the Angel nodded sadly.<br />
      <br />
      "On top of that, it's them who are right. ...geez. If the humans accepted
      the prophecy in the 2000th year, we would have gotten away by just being
      the victim "<br />
      <br />
      "No...! The ones who are wrong are the Aristoteles. They don't have any
      will. Isn't it a bad thing to erase lives without having a will?"<br />
      <br />
      The Angel who learned the common sense of this planet said that.<br />
      <br />
      But there was no longer any notion of right or wrong on this planet. The
      only simple rule was that you either live or die.<br />
      <br />
      That's why---- because I lived till now, I'm not going to be on the dying
      side.<br />
      <br />
      "It won't change anything. I don't have any reason to fight either. I
      probably will never have any. At the point that we are just killing each
      other for no reason, we are equal. Isn't this the most simple way of
      life?"<br />
      <br />
      The Angel won't answer.<br />
      <br />
      "What are you going to do? Even if you have the same objective, that Cross
      and you are different things right? Then your body will be destroyed along
      with this city. You said you died instantly, but that's in our standards.
      I doubt the concept of death on this planet applies to a life form on
      another planet. Aren't you able to move already?"<br />
      <br />
      The Angel facing down shook her head.<br />
      <br />
      "No. If I move, the outer shell of the wings will shatter. All the leaves
      of what everyone calls the World Tree will fall. If that happens,
      uncountable numbers of angels will come pouring down. If that happens,
      everyone will die before the Aristoteles comes"<br />
      <br />
      The gloomy Angel said that.<br />
      <br />
      ...She's right. The number of leaves of the tree that reaches the clouds
      is far more than the number of surviving human species. Billions of
      released angels will cover the whole planet in no time.<br />
      <br />
      "But you'll die if you don't"<br />
      <br />
      "It's all right. I am the people here. I am only an image created by
      them."<br />
      <br />
      "It's just that they provided you knowledge. You are different from us. To
      you, we are just simple accessories. You should hurry up and take it off
      so you'll feel light."<br />
      <br />
      The Angel sadly smiled, and again shook her head.<br />
      <br />
      "You're an idiot."<br />
      <br />
      "I know I am. But I can't help it.<br />
      -------------I love this place."<br />
      <br />
      With teary eyes, the Angel said that with a feeling of satisfaction.<br />
      <br />
      How can I argue with that?<br />
      <br />
      "...Okay. I suppose that can't be helped."<br />
      <br />
      Yes, as the Angel nodded her head, she stared at me. Her straight eyes
      were asking me, how about you?<br />
      <br />
      "I'm going to die soon, you know. I think you can at least tell me that
      and the heavens won't punish you."<br />
      <br />
      ...The punishment itself that came to this planet said that irresponsibly.
      <br />
      As I carried my belonging on my back, I replied.<br />
      <br />
      "Yeah. I'll be honest. I love this city too. ------------Besides, since
      that moment, I was obsessed with you."<br />
      <br />
      Huh, the Angel opened her eyes widely in surprise.<br />
      <br />
      "----U,um. What does that mean?"<br />
      <br />
      "It must mean I've fallen in love with you, since then. I just realized
      that now"<br />
      <br />
      When I threw out the words, the Angel sparkled her expression, but quickly
      put her head down.<br />
      <br />
      "But I'm not a human being"<br />
      <br />
      The Angel realized something like that just now.<br />
      <br />
      ....Geez, She's a real idiot.<br />
      <br />
      "You know. There's only one human being left in the world and that's me.
      What does that have to do with anything?"<br />
      <br />
      "Oh you're right. "<br />
      The Angel nodded in impression.<br />
      <br />
      There's nothing else to talk about. I started walking outside as the time
      of the military gathering approached.<br />
      <br />
      "See you. Go to someone with a better dream next time. You can become a
      real angel if you do that"<br />
      <br />
      ----My imagination was always twisted somewhere.<br />
      <br />
      When I looked back at her one last time, the angel answered in a gentle
      expression, no.<br />
      <br />
      "There's no such thing as a real angel. I rather stay a fake one."<br />
      <br />
      The fantasy said that it will stay as a fantasy.<br />
      <br />
      Is that so? Convinced, I left the room.<br />
      <br />
      All that was left in the room was my older sister's guitar and the fake
      angel.
