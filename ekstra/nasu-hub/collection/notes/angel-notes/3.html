      <br />
      On my way home from work, I got caught by an angel.<br />
      Not the Angel at home, but an actual angel within the A-ray branch.<br />
      <br />
      "You're not very sociable lately. Rejecting an invitation from a pretty
      person like me, you must be an impotent."<br />
      <br />
      She said that as she pushed me into a bar and offering a glass of
      alcohol. ...It's true I haven't spoke to her for about a half a year.
      <br />
      <br />
      While we were having some casual conversation, a bunch of hecklers
      butted in. They say the angel should accompany the A-rays instead of
      that human. I thought so too, but she shut them up by a glare.<br />
      <br />
      "I'm sorry, were you offended?"<br />
      <br />
      "Yeah, I don't feel good about it, but they're right. Why do you care
      about someone like me. Don't the A-rays find a love partner in order to
      produce stronger species? I won't be able to create strong children."<br />
      <br />
      "It doesn't hurt for an exception, does it? Besides, our outside
      appearance matters more for us. There's not many species that are close
      to the angels, and you're my type. There's no problem."<br />
      <br />
      She said that as she drank the purple fizz in her glass.<br />
      <br />
      Her appearance was a real angel. Her wings weren't used for flying, but
      used as a dish to collect the heavy particles in the surroundings. The
      angel species were able to fly without wings. Originally being the
      protectors of the A-ray called the Six Sisters, the angels were
      considered to have an equal fighting power as the Knights who carried
      the Demonic Sword. <br />
      In other words, they can perform a destructive activity as a nuclear
      bomb on their own.<br />
      <br />
      As we drank more alcohol and more or less of our true characters were
      shown, she asked a weird question.<br />
      <br />
      "Hey, why do you use a gun?"<br />
      <br />
      "Humans can't use Gin like you A-rays, you know. Our strength is limited
      as well, so it's natural we have to rely on weapons. What other
      practical firearms are there other than a gun?"<br />
      <br />
      "Hmm. That means humans aren't made to fight. But why do you still
      fight?"<br />
      <br />
      "...Let's see. If I recall correctly, my family was killed when I was
      small. That's when I dug up a gun and practiced shooting so I can take
      revenge."<br />
      <br />
      "Oh, typical."<br />
      <br />
      Yeah, it's typical, I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. I never succeeded
      in trying to make a forced smile.<br />
      <br />
      "But doesn't a family mean they were of the same species? I never heard
      of any humans living around here."<br />
      <br />
      "I haven't told you, have I. I was originally born in West Land. The
      other side of the great rift."<br />
      <br />
      "West Land... You mean the continent that got wiped out by the Black
      Aristoteles-----?"<br />
      <br />
      Surprised, she fell silent. When West Land was completely scorched, I
      was a kid of only 12 or 13. <br />
      <br />
      An old story from almost 7 years ago.<br />
      <br />
      "By the way, do you still do that job?"<br />
      <br />
      "I do. There isn't any other job opportunity for a halfwit like me. I
      don't want to be kept under a protection as rare species either.
      ...What, are you still complaining? They are different from you. Don't
      be so concerned, it's silly."<br />
      <br />
      "I am concerned. I don't mind others to do it, but it makes me angry to
      think that you out of all people are killing angels everyday. Hey. Why
      do you hunt angels?"<br />
      <br />
      --------That is because I am twisted.<br />
      <br />
      "-------It's my job, I can't help it. "<br />
      <br />
      I said that without looking at her eyes. She gave me a cold look, seeing
      through my lie.<br />
      <br />
      "You're right. You've quit thinking. That's why you don't feel any pain.
      But, on the other hand, you don't feel any happiness either. You never
      have fun by recalling the past either. Your life must be like the
      machine you use. That's why you need to rely on something simple like
      logical reasoning in order to motivate yourself.<br />
      <br />
      The angel said that with a discontent expression. But what's so wrong
      with being a machine. A theory that higher life forms having emotions
      was a real fantasy.<br />
      <br />
      "What's wrong with you today? You seem to be very picky"<br />
      <br />
      "No kidding. It's because you won't talk to me"<br />
      <br />
      "A drunken angel isn't very appealing."<br />
      <br />
      "What do you mean. I may look like this, but I'm very popular in my home
      town."<br />
      <br />
      Answering, yeah yeah, I sipped on my glass. I was suppose to restrain
      myself tonight, but I'm passing out before her.<br />
      <br />
      The angel asked me her last question.<br />
      <br />
      "Hey, why do you fight?"<br />
      <br />
      That's because I don't want to die.<br />
      <br />
      "Then, why don't you want to die?"<br />
      <br />
      Probably because I want to live.<br />
      <br />
      "Why do you want to live?"<br />
      <br />
      That's obvious.<br />
      <br />
      Because, I never got to experience anything good.<br />
      <br />
      "...Is that so. Needing logical reason in order to live, you're an
      underdeveloped life form."<br />
      <br />
      Saying that, she left first.<br />
      <br />
      But how can I help it. Because the human race kept on living by their
      instinct, the world died once. Having to rely on pessimistic reasoning
      is the only punishment given to the humans who were left behind. <br />
