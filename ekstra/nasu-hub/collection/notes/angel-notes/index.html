      now wild lands that are torn apart, covered by a tainted gray colored
      cloud. <br />
      Food can't be grown, and the atmosphere is no longer suited for the
      animals.<br />
      To put it in a human species way, a drastic end of a century. But even
      after the mother planet died, the humans were able to live on with its
      developed civil technology.<br />
      Even the planet's end where people once imagined, couldn't bring an end to
      mankind.<br />

      corrupted planet. There were numerous branches to the A-rays, and they
      were categorized into about 100 major species. From 1 to 10 consists of
      only one type of A-rays each and not a mass.<br />
      Some carry the genes of humans and they look like us, but a large part of

      don't carry any ability more than a normal human being.<br />
      They are building a country in order to reconstruct their old
      civilization. Cease-fire with the Hundred A-rays.<br />
      <br />
      大戦 [Babel's Tale] taisen<br />
      The Great War<br />
      After the death of the planet, there was a war between the survived human
      race and the Hundred A-rays.<br />
      Mankind in order to survive, and the A-rays to rule the world.<br />
      Under the Six-Sisters who united the unmassed A-rays, the human race were
      on the verge of defeat. Near the end of the war, mankind created the
      Knights and the Human Species, and it further killed the planet that's
      already dead.<br />
      There was no victor to this war. It was interrupted by an intruder that
      suddenly appeared and nearly wiped out both sides.<br />
      <br />

      Knights<br />
      Life form that received an even stronger effect from the drastic
      environment. They wield a special weapon called the Demonic Swords.
      Aggressive species that can fight the A-rays equally without any support
      of firearms of the old age. There are currently 78 Knights enlisted.<br />

      魔剣 [knight arms] maken<br />
      Demonic/Magical Sword<br />
      The name of the weapon that Knights carry.<br />
      All human species born in this world are effected by Gin. Babies born with
      a large amount of Gin in them shape it as if it's their bones during their
      lives, and when they reach adulthood, it is laid outside their body.
      Because it is created with the unanalyzed entity Gin, it is able to cause
      various effects and its power is strong enough to be considered a weapon.
      <br />
      Only few humans can shape the Demonic Swords, and those who carry a
      Demonic Sword powerful enough to be used for war are considered as
      Knights. Only one Demonic Sword exists per Knight.<br />
      <br />
      ジン [grain "Ether"] <br />
      Gin<br />
      Space dust. Name given to all the harmful and unpredictable particles
      generated from the planet that lost its function. Although it is harmful
      to humans, sometimes it gives an unique effect to their body, and some
      call it Ether. The Hundred A-rays, Human Species, Knights, are all new
      species created by this Gin. The energy transfer rate of the Gin scattered
      in atmosphere is incredible, and it resulted in a new level of warfare
      that was never possible on this planet.<br />
      With A-rays who can take in Gin into their body and Demonic Swords
      crystallized by Gin, all the weapons of the old age became useless.<br />

      人間 [Last-Seed] ningen<br />
      Humans<br />
      Human species who hasn't received any modification, or their descendent.

      they are on the verge of extinction. <br />
      In order for humans to live outside, they need support from medication or
      machines. They can't directly inhale the air, nor can they eat the food
      made in the factory because they raise the physical ability too much that
      they become poisonous. <br />
      They are rare, but have no value.<br />

      The Sky, it's Dark.<br />
      Sky covered by clouds. The thick layers of cloud hides the sky since the
      great war. It doesn't mean the sky is gray; they just can't see the

      天使 [No.20 Guardian Angel] tenshi<br />
      Angel<br />

      angel in the largest religion of the old age. A human type that has a pair
      of bird wings.<br />

      アリストテレス [ Ultimate ONE] <br />
      Aristoteles<br />
      8 Life forms that appeared near the end of the war. Unknown existences.<br />
      Not only their appearance, but each of their biology differs
      significantly.<br />
      The reason they used this name is a mystery, but the origin is probably a
      scientist from the old age. <br />
      Considering mankind and A-ray as their enemies, they repetitively attacked
      them indiscriminately. Mankind were broken their platform completely, and
      the hundred A-rays decreased in number significantly by them. <br />
      After the Great War was over, they slowed down their activity by the sea
      of clouds that covered the sky, but they still continue to slaughter the
      living things on the planet.<br />
      Since then, the human species and the A-rays ceased fire, and till they
      destroy the common enemy, they grouped themselves together as the human
      race.<br />
      <br />

      witches in a fairy story wearing a black hat and riding on a broom stick.
      Each one of them carried an ability that surpasses all the hundred A-rays.
      <br />
      Near the end of the Great War, the youngest sister, "Judge" was defeated
      by a Knight, but her death cry tore apart a continent. The whereabouts of
      the remaining five is unknown.<br />
      <br />
      黒いアリストテレス [type:jupiter] kuroi aristoteles<br />
      The Black Aristoteles<br />
      An Aristoteles that appeared in the western continent.<br />
      A black giant several dozen kilometers in size. Its form was pretty close
      to a human. <br />
      It was actually a group of black photon gas, and theoretically its size
      can expand infinitely. It carries a unknown core in its center that can
      only be described as an artificial sun, and the gases are emitted from
      this object. <br />
      Of the 8 Aristoteles, it eliminated the most living things. The western
      continent went on an all out battle, and it wiped them out without a scar.
      ... Although there's probably no such thing as a scar to this Aristoteles.
      <br />
      After this incident, a team of Knights were sent to the western continent.
      After a fierce battle, it was sliced into half by the demonic sword of
      Knight Edem, the Slash Emperor. The chopped artificial sun went berserk
      and burned the whole western continent.<br />
      <br />
      十字架 [type:saturn] jyuujika<br />
      The Cross<br />
      A cross shaped Aristoteles that is 3000 meters long. <br />
      It's outer shell is composed of an illuminating mineral, and there's
      nothing else. This flying object fires a rain of light to the ground from
      its body.<br />
      The rain is a cross shaped electric impact that is a meter long, and it
      explodes as it hits the ground, annihilating the living things around it.
      There are variations to this cross shaped light and some causes an
      earthquake that tears apart the earth as it lands on the ground. The
      crosses struck on the ground are just like tombs spread about on the wild
      land.<br />
      aka the Flying Fortress, it seems to be the leader of the Aristoteles's
      that are on the planet.
      <br />
      ブラックバレル [Longinus]<br />
      Black Barrel<br />
      A black rifle that the Gun God uses. Created by a mineral that counters
      all Gin, it's a weapon that is feared by life forms that carry any slight
      amount of Gin.<br />
      But because all living beings that exists in the world are affected by
      Gin, it is impossible for them use or even touch it.<br />
      The God killer gun. If the target creature is stronger... in other words,
      the more Gin it carries, the more powerful the bullet becomes.<br />
      ...Today, only the rare species that weren't able to evolve and doesn't
      carry any Gins can touch this gun.<br />
      <br />
      空が、赤い [blood sky] sora ga akai<br />
      The Sky, it's Red.<br />
      The Sky in this world. Above the gray sea of clouds, there is not a blue,
      but a red sky.<br />
      It's not because of a pollution, but from the blood of one of the
      Aristoteles that appeared near the end of the Great War, Type-Pluto.<br />
      In order to not let Pluto enter the planet's atmosphere, the Six Sisters
      fought it and killed each other at the same time, and its blood covered
      the whole planet as a result. The gray cloud is said to be a shield that
      the Six Sisters placed.<br />
      Within this red sky, the two Aristoteles that are prevented from entering
      the planet is floating like fishes that swim in the sea.<br />
      <br />

      Aristoteles's, it was close to this planet's species <br />
      According to the records, it was shot down in the mission by the Knights
      in the 83rd year of the new calendar, and it fell somewhere on the
      continent. Originally, it was a life form that lands on the earth of a
      planet, rooting itself, and spreading its spore as it eats away the
      planet.<br />
      It can also be described a gigantic carnivorous plant. <br />
      ...It was put to an eternal sleep by the Black Barrel.<br />

      アリストテレス [Ultimate ONE] <br />
      Aristoteles<br />
      Life forms that came from the other planets.<br />
      They were the strongest life forms on their respective planets, and each
      of them had the power to wipe out all the remaining living beings in this
      world. <br />
      The name Aristoteles was given by the humans, and they have no such things
      in the first place. The Aristoteles don't fight each other, and they just
      freely fly around killing things.<br />
      Several Aristoteles among them contacted mankind learning about this
      planet's concept of "knowledge". <br />
      After Type-Saturn, who received orders from their respective planets and
      sent it to the others, got eliminated, they entered a final war with the
      human race.<br />
