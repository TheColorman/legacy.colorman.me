      5 / How a Star is Born<br />
      <br />
      A huge flying cross moved away within the ashen clouds.<br />
      That thing which changed its course started disappearing from sight as it
      kept on pouring the rain of judgment.<br />
      <br />
      -----It seems like the battle is over.<br />
      <br />
      The air plane that I was on kept on increasing its altitude through the
      troposphere.<br />
      On the side of the plane was a big hole.<br />
      <br />
      The wounded iron bird could no longer listen to what's told to do. It just
      kept on flying till its end as if it's the dream of all who have wings.<br />
      <br />
      Soon or later, it will fly out of the ashen sea of clouds and reach the
      stratosphere. My body wasn't built so strong that I could breath at such
      place. But I don't have to worry about that. There's no guarantee that I
      would be alive by the time I reach there.<br />
      <br />
      I leaned on the wall as I brought my gun down. <br />
      <br />
      The door of the hanger remained opened. Just like how it once was, cold
      air blew in and I could see the earth very well.<br />
      Land without any colors. Even the ocean in the distance was colorless.<br />
      <br />
      That was a world that is completely dead.<br />
      <br />
      Even then. This world of steel, even then, felt so precious and my vision
      blurred.<br />
      <br />
      ......<br />
      <br />
      I've seen something like this 5 years ago.<br />
      <br />
      That day, the enemy that appeared through the clouds was beautiful than
      anything.<br />
      A pair of wings and a figure that somehow resembles a human. I shot that
      thing that looked like an angel. The bullet that is nothing more than a
      grain of bean to that thing, drilled into its forehead and dropped the
      angel.<br />
      <br />
      That moment. The instant I pulled the trigger, our eyes met through the
      scope. There was no communication. That's all. <br />
      <br />
      But since then, I kept dreaming of that thing falling down the sea of
      clouds, forever.<br />
      <br />
      ......<br />
      <br />
      The angel that accompanied the plane woke up. One of her wings was
      horribly ripped.<br />
      <br />
      Being a high ranking species of the A-rays, she was naturally forced to
      join this mission, and jumped in here after getting heavily wounded.<br />
      <br />
      She only came here to rest her wings, but we were out of luck. The moment
      she came in when the hanger opened, the arrow of light hit this plane that
      was too close to the Cross.<br />
      <br />
      The light pierced through her wing and the body of the plane, and took out
      her consciousness and the plane's AI.<br />
      <br />
      And now several minutes later. The angel who was unconscious slowly woke
      up.<br />
      <br />
      Good Morning, when I said that to her, she turned around and looked
      outside.<br />
      The thing called the Aristoteles was disappearing in the distant
      direction.<br />
      <br />
      I told the angel who was spacing out our total loss and the success of the
      mission.<br />
      <br />
      The angel approached in joy. As she crawled on the floor since she
      couldn't stand up, her hand slipped on something wet.<br />
      My blood that spilled over the floor made a pool and dyed the angel's body
      red.<br />
      <br />
      "When you------ shoved me aside?"<br />
      <br />
      Without answering her question, I just gazed outside.<br />
      Over the limitless clouds, the air plane kept on flying upwards.<br />
      <br />
      The sky that I saw for the first time, was different from what I read in
      the books.<br />
      <br />
      "The sky, it's red"<br />
      <br />
      Repeating a phrase that I once heard somewhere, I couldn't hold strength
      in my hand anymore. The Black Gun fell to the floor.<br />
      <br />
      "The Black Gun. So you really were the person who shot the Bird down."<br />
      <br />
      "...I guess. That's what people say. But I used all my luck back then.
      Look at this mess now."<br />
      <br />
      "Idiot. Because you saved me..."<br />
      <br />
      "How can I help it. I wouldn't want a pretty girl like you dying in front
      of my eyes."<br />
      <br />
      I said something really showy. It was so silly that it made me laugh.<br />
      <br />
      That doesn't suit your character, she said that too.<br />
      <br />
      We just kept on laughing without looking each other's way.<br />
      <br />
      It was a small, weak, and a gentle voice.<br />
      <br />
      "You've changed. You weren't this honest with your feelings before. So it
      is true that you've found someone else than me."<br />
      <br />
      ...I wonder if there was really such thing. Although if it's the angel who
      said she rather be a fake, she must be still waiting in my room for me to
      return.<br />
      <br />
      They say that angels cure one's mind, not one's body.<br />
      <br />
      "But that's not true. People don't change because of others I was always
      like this. I just acted like I didn't care, but I really was a good
      person. You couldn't tell, could you?" <br />
      "Oh, really?"<br />
      <br />
      "Yeah, really. I wanted to become an hero when I was small too. I was
      immature, probably now too. ...That's why go. You can probably still fly
      down to the ground even with one wing. You don't need to come with me"<br />
      <br />
      She stood up and looked at me strictly for some reason.<br />
      <br />
      "Are you going to be okay? To be alone till the end"<br />
      <br />
      "Didn't I tell you? I want to look cool. Because I wanted to be a hero.
      And I want to be alone at the end. -----Because I was all alone till
      now."<br />
      I think my clumsy forced smile went well.<br />
      Probably the best in my life.<br />
      <br />
      "Good bye, then"<br />
      <br />
      Flapping her single sided wing, she flew out.<br />
      She looked like a fish of an angel that swam in the red sea.<br />
      <br />
      -----------------<br />
      <br />
      I stood up and sat on the cockpit.<br />
      Not knowing what I'm doing myself, I tried fixing the broken AI.<br />
      <br />
      If I still have some luck left, my fate might change.<br />
      <br />
      When I closed my eyes, I heard a voice.<br />
      <br />
      "Why did you fight?"<br />
      <br />
      "Because I didn't want to die, of course"<br />
      <br />
      "Why didn't you want to die?"<br />
      <br />
      "Because I want to live, of course"<br />
      <br />
      "...Then, why did you want to live?"<br />
      <br />
      That's obvious. It's because------<br />
      <br />
      At the farthest limit of my memory.<br />
      Only that answer was different from before. <br />
