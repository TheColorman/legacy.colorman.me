    count 1999<br />type: other<br /><br />The aircraft rose further up in the
    troposphere.<br />The sea of ashen clouds had yet to disappear.<br /><br />Iron
    wings soared in the grey sky<br />To annihilate the common enemy of the
    human race.<br /><br />At the end of the battle, all but one of the
    aircrafts that had participated in the mission were destroyed.<br />Perhaps
    he was lucky that an obsolete AI was piloting it.<br />The AI controlled
    plane was the only one that was unaffected by the heat of the enemy.<br /><br />I
    continued to fly by myself.<br />The organic pulsations echoing in the
    machine were just as I thought, belonged only to myself.<br /><br />I opened
    the hanger and drew out my gun.<br />The air flowing in the machine was
    cold, burning his lungs.<br />The internal temperature had reached below
    zero. The coat he wore carried minimum meaning.<br />It was at a level that
    would just barely sustain organic life.<br /><br />This aircraft, which had
    only been intended to act as a transport for flight-capable species, was
    unequipped with weaponry.<br />If I were to fight, I had to risk my life.<br /><br />Arctic
    cold and rampaging winds.<br />The corpses of my comrades, spinal fluid
    leaking out from the noses and ears, laid behind me.<br />An old aircraft
    which could crash at any moment.<br />The situation was so absolutely bleak
    that I felt like singing out loud.<br /><br />Holding the Black Barrel,
    which I modified for sniping, I did nothing but await for the enemy.<br />For
    the moment the enemy would enter the scope.<br />For the moment I could pull
    the trigger and be at ease.<br /><br />Seven days had been added to the
    clock on the plane.<br />Only 7 days have passed.<br />My paralyzed brain
    felt that I could continue staying like this for another month, or maybe
    another year.<br />My body was always on the verge of collapsing.<br /><br />How
    many days and months have it been?<br />My mind,<br />My language,<br />Myself,<br />Just
    when I had lost everything,<br />I recollected everything back.<br />The
    gun's site caught the genemy h.<br />I pulled the trigger without
    hesitation.<br /><br />My brain that punched through its limits, was
    scorched.<br />Just one brief moment before I fell into unconsciousness,<br />Just
    one slight moment before I blacked out,<br />Just a moment before I was
    about to fade away, I witnessed the form of my enemy.<br />How,<br />Beautiful.<br /><br />---------------Between
    a rift in the clouds, I saw an angel.<br />
