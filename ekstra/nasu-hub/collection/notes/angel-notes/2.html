        A female body having a pair of bird wings on the back. On top of that, it
        if also has a beautiful form, then that life form is called an angel.<br />
        <br />
        My job was to shoot down twenty of those angels a day. That's why it
        wasn't that surprising for me to be seen as an enemy by all who were
        angels.<br />
        <br />
        ------------------------------<br />
        <br />
        I came to this city a year ago. The strangest city within the land of
        steel.<br />
        No plants were able to grow on the soil of this planet. However, there
        were numerous grey colored trees within the city, and even an withered
        grass field on top of a hill. In the hill at the center of the city, there
        were two gigantic trees that covered the sky. These trees reached the sea
        of clouds, and it was called the World Trees for their size.<br />
        <br />
        ------------------------------<br />
        <br />
        I chose my job as an angel hunter. In this city, angel came down from the
        sky and attacked people everyday. Although they do attack people, they're
        only at an annoying level of wild dogs, and not many were actually
        affected.<br />
        But if we left them alone, the city would be filled with angels, so the
        city council had to hire hunters.<br />
        I don't know if the angels have a set location they come down to, but I
        saw a lot of them in the forest of the city outskirt.<br />
        <br />
        Pulling on the trigger of the gun, I absorbed the impact on my
        shoulder.<br />
        The naked angel fell down and hit the floor as it was shot right in the
        forehead.<br />
        On the floor of the forest, there were leaves and countless number of dead
        angels.<br />
        Going across the rough surface of the earth, I return into the walls that
        surrounded the city. A beast man who was appointed another area was waving
        his hand as he approached me.<br />
        <br />
        "Hey. How's it going."<br />
        <br />
        "Not much. Three coppers per kill. If I consider the cost of the bullet, I
        won't even have single copper for myself."<br />
        <br />
        "It's because you use a gun. If you're a man, use your body."<br />
        <br />
        "Well I'm sorry but I'm not that well built. I even need to take
        medication in order to get oxygen. I'm doing my best just to live"<br />
        <br />
        "I see. You humans are so inconvenient."<br />
        <br />
        "Indeed. Being human is inconvenient"<br />
        <br />
        Yes, in this world humans are certainly inconvenient. <br />
        That's why human beings in the old age made a lot of creative tools. As a
        result A-rays were invented, and that ended up as the Great War.<br />
        <br />
        That's how pure human beings were gone.<br />
        <br />
        After a free loader called the angel stayed at my house, I increased my
        work load.<br />
        That angel ate food. Although the materials produced at the factory is
        free, there's a limit to it. So I had to increase my daily quota from
        twenty to thirty.<br />
        ...How ironic was it to kill more angels to feed an angel.<br />
        <br />
        "You're working hard lately"<br />
        <br />
        "I'm just releasing my stress. Those targets actually look very alike to
        the cause of my stress, and makes this lame job exciting."<br />
        <br />
        I couldn't help it and let it out. The beast man tilted his head.<br />
        <br />
        "It's good thing that you're dedicated to your job. But watch out, they
        said there were some Knights who were inspecting the forest. I heard a
        Demonic Sword user was looking at you."<br />
        <br />
        "----What does that mean? Is there an Aristoteles coming this way?"<br />
        <br />
        "I dunno. More importantly, our pay is supposedly lowered this month
        again. That's a more realistic problem."<br />
        <br />
        "Right. Is the financial bureau ready to kill us now?"<br />
        <br />
        "I never done anything wrong though."<br />
        <br />
        Said a prisoner who murdered over fifty human species.<br />
        <br />
        The beast man sighed as he looked at the pile of dead angels scattered
        across the forest.<br />
        <br />
        "Hey, you think we can eat them?"<br />
        <br />
        He muttered a bad idea.<br />
        <br />
        "Forget it. You'll be punished by heaven, I bet"<br />
        <br />
        I made an obvious reply as I shrugged my shoulders. <br />
