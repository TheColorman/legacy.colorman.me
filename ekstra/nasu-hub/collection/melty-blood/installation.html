    <h1>Installation</h1>
    <h2>Melty Blood, ReACT or Act Cadenza</h2>
    Extract the .iso from the .7z then either burn the .iso to a CD or DVD or
    mount it using a program like WinCDEmu. Run the English version installer
    (not the Japanese installer on the disk) and the game will install. ReACT is
    an expansion pack for the original Melty Blood so you need to install that
    first for it to work. ReACT won’t run if it can’t find the original Melty
    Blood to run so it’s best not to move the installation folders around for
    either.

    <h2>Actress Again Current Code</h2>
    Extract MBAACC.7z wherever then extract the English patch inside that
    (overwrite the original files with the English files). The english patch
    will also bring the game to rev1.4.0 which is the latest version.
