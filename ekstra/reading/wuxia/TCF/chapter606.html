<p>The trees that had just been saplings until a moment ago were growing exponentially.</p><p>&ldquo;...My goodness!&rdquo;</p><p>The person who was the most shocked was the person who had spread the seeds and grown those saplings. Jae Ha-Jung was the most shocked.</p><p>It was because he had a similar ability. That was the reason he was shocked more than anybody else.</p><p>&rsquo;How can he have such an ability?!&rsquo;</p><p>Jae Ha-Jung&rsquo;s gaze looked astonished, no, mesmerized as he looked past Choi Jung Soo to Cale.</p><p>&rsquo;How many abilities does this person have? And each of them are extremely strong abilities!&rsquo;</p><p>But Jae Ha-Jung&rsquo;s eyes were sparkling even more as he looked at these growing trees.</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s different!&rsquo;</p><p>The power Cale had used during the original shelter battle and this power were fundamentally different.</p><p>&rsquo;This is at a completely different level!&rsquo;</p><p>He could feel a strong power coming from the trees that was incomparable to what he experienced before.</p><p>That was why his sparkling gaze started to shake.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale coughed up more blood.</p><p>Jae Ha-Jung was thinking that things might end up really bad like this. That was how serious Cale&rsquo;s condition was right now.</p><p>&ldquo;...Haaaa. Noonim.&rdquo;</p><p>But Cale just wiped away the blood and ignored his condition.</p><p>No, he tried his best to forget about it.</p><p>What he did from here on was very important.</p><p>He needed to focus.</p><p>In order to do that, it would be best to be closer to the spot he needed to focus his power.</p><p>&ldquo;Please put me down.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Huh? Dongsaeng, will you be okay?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;O, okay! I&rsquo;ll do as you say for now!&rdquo;</p><p>The Steel Feather Hawk quickly moved to where Cale had pointed.</p><p>Cale&rsquo;s body staggered from the speed, but Choi Jung Soo quickly supported him.</p><p>"Thanks.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;......Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>The Steel Feather Hawk stopped on the tree that was closest to the castle gate.</p><p>Cale landed on the top branch of a tree that grew resembling a watchtower.</p><p>Choi Jung Soo and Jae Ha-Jung were with him as well.</p><p>But the people on the castle walls that had been fighting off the monsters until now could only see Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;...Shit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My goodness.&rdquo;</p><p>They were at a loss for words after properly seeing Cale's condition.</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>Someone started to mumble.</p><p>&ldquo;...We really... Are seeing the most of that back.&rdquo;</p><p>They recalled the promise that their young commander had given them.</p><p>&rsquo;Furthermore, the people here will fight while looking at my back the most, at least for this battle.&rsquo;</p><p>Their commander had kept his promise.</p><p>Everybody could feel the weight of that promise after seeing his current condition.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we just going to stand around like this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No. We need to do something as well.&rdquo;</p><p>The atmosphere on top of the castle walls had changed.</p><p>They could not just keep going like this.</p><p>They needed to do something.</p><p>Those emotions started to roar wildly in their hearts. The sight of their leader fighting in the front was bound to light a fire in the hearts of those who followed him.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that?!&rdquo;</p><p>There were some people whose hearts were lit up more than the others.</p><p>In fact, the heat was reaching up to the top of their heads.</p><p>These people were Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum. These two who had trained with Cale could now see Cale&rsquo;s condition up close.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he can hold on!&rdquo;</p><p>Bae Puh Rum looked ready to fly up to the top of the tree where Cale was standing at any moment.</p><p>&ldquo;We do not have much time.&rdquo;</p><p>But everybody stopped after hearing a person's voice.</p><p>It was Choi Han.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going first.&rdquo;</p><p>That was all he said before he started to move.</p><p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum then saw it.</p><p>Baaaaaang-!</p><p>They saw Choi Han getting on top of a large tree root that was quickly growing.</p><p>That tree root then quickly headed toward the yellow monster.</p><p>&ldquo;Chsssssssssssssch! Ch!&rdquo;</p><p>The monster seemed flustered after seeing the tree roots and trunks that were trying to bind it from all directions.</p><p>It tried to dodge, but that would not be easy to do.</p><p>&ldquo;It can't dig underground!&rdquo;</p><p>Bae Puh Rum could see the roots thoroughly covering the ground.</p><p>He finally realized what Cale was trying to do.</p><p>&rsquo;He&rsquo;s trying to tie it up!&rsquo;</p><p>He was trying to bind the monster.</p><p>&rsquo;That means that there will be an opening for us to attack!&rsquo;</p><p>The yellow monster could use water, electricity and poison, but Cale could also use water and electricity.</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s worth trying!&rsquo;</p><p>They would finally be able to attack properly!</p><p>Bae Puh Rum was the last one to realize that fact.</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk and Kim Min Ah were already on top of other tree roots and heading toward the yellow monster.</p><p>The first large tree root reached the yellow monster at that moment.</p><p>It started to bind it.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>A different cry than before came out of the monster&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>It could not be helped.</p><p>A sturdy boulder-like dirt covered the monster&rsquo;s body.</p><p>It had its almost invincible scales underneath it as well.</p><p>But these trees that were moving toward the monster as if they were snakes did not wish to cause damage to this monster.</p><p>They wanted to twist the life out of it. They wanted to make it unable to move.</p><p>The monster realized what was going on.</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>Golden currents charged toward the trees in the shape of spears.</p><p>Cale started to smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I can't let you do that.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Will you be okay?</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>Rose gold currents flew over like arrows and exploded once they crashed into the spears.</p><p>Cale lowered his body as if he was leaning on the ledge of the watchtower.</p><p>Drip. Drip.</p><p>His nose was bleeding without stopping.</p><p>He had used the half-powered Fire of Destruction while using the full powered version of the Indestructible Shield's tree ability.</p><p>The burden on his body was to be expected.</p><p>But Cale was smiling.</p><p>It was because the opening created by that explosion had given him just the thing that he had needed.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>The first tree root wrapped around the monster&rsquo;s tail.</p><p>The yellow monster&rsquo;s bluish yellow eyes could see tens, no, hundreds of tree roots and branches swarming toward it.</p><p>This was completely different than any of the abilities that the other humans had used until now.</p><p>It felt as if this person was controlling nature itself.</p><p>The yellow monster made eye contact with Cale.</p><p>That was the beginning.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooooooooooooar!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>The monster started to flail and Cale clenched a branch on the tree that he was standing on.</p><p>The former did it to run while the latter did it to capture it.</p><p>The only common thing between these two existences was that they were both fighting with their lives on the line.</p><p>They were both quite desperate as well.</p><p>They both knew that they didn't have much time.</p><p>If there was a difference between the two...</p><p>Cale had friends by his side.</p><p>&ldquo;Min Ah.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn after Choi Han.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Puh Rum and I will go after you then.&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Min Ah looked toward Choi Han who was up in the front.</p><p>But Lee Soo Hyuk was looking at Cale. Unlike Kim Min Ah who couldn't bear to look, Lee Soo Hyuk was remembering each and every one of Cale&rsquo;s appearances.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I would be fighting while looking at his back.&rdquo;</p><p>The corners of Lee Soo Hyuk&rsquo;s lips twisted up.</p><p>He then looked forward.</p><p>He heard a voice drifting away as he looked at Choi Han&rsquo;s back.</p><p>&ldquo;Horn.&rdquo;</p><p>That was all Choi Han said before jumping off the tree root and into the air.</p><p>Tatap.</p><p>A different tree root appeared just under his feet.</p><p>It was the same tree root that had wrapped around the yellow monster&rsquo;s tail.</p><p>&rsquo;We can&rsquo;t let it get away.&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han was desperate.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t have the time to look back or to stop.</p><p>He knew that the opportunity that Cale had created for them was extremely precious.</p><p>That was why he quickly started to run up the monster&rsquo;s body.</p><p>&ldquo;Rooooooooooooar! Roooooooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>The monster flailed around.</p><p>It shot out electrical currents, but they were all blocked by Cale, giving it no choice but to twist its body to flail around.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The monster&rsquo;s body made dull noises as it slammed into the trees.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han ended up slamming into a few trees because of the movements as well.</p><p>He almost fell off a couple times.</p><p>But he did not stop.</p><p>In fact, he was smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;It knows I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>Peek.</p><p>The yellow monster was looking at him.</p><p>The enemy had already noticed Choi Han a long time ago.</p><p>That was why it was flailing around even more.</p><p>It was because it knew that Choi Han had something that could injure it.</p><p>But Choi Han was already close enough to the monster&rsquo;s head that the two of them could make eye contact.</p><p>&rsquo;This is enough!&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han jumped into the air after making that conclusion.</p><p>He then had a sad smile on his face before it disappeared.</p><p>Wind gathered around his ankles and tree trunks appeared in the air to create stepping stones for him.</p><p>Choi Han could feel Cale supporting him and creating a path for him.</p><p>Chhhhhhhhhhhh!</p><p>A violent black aura viciously wrapped around his sword.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooooooooooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>The monster opened its mouth and revealed its poisonous fangs toward Choi Han.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>But tree trunks quickly blocked its mouth.</p><p>Choi Han was finally able to reach his destination thanks to his friend&rsquo;s power that had blocked the attack.</p><p>He was looking at the places on the monster&rsquo;s body that were neither covered in scales nor dirt.</p><p>Slash.</p><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s sword slashed in a horizontal line.</p><p>Slaaash!</p><p>He had not been able to make any damages on the scales.</p><p>However, the things he was slashing right now were...</p><p>"Screeeeeeeeeech---!&rdquo;</p><p>Bluish yellow blood spurt out of the monster&rsquo;s two eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;First the eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s sword started to move again.</p><p>He could not stop.</p><p>A proper fight was finally starting.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star started to frown.</p><p>His fire sword clashed against a white spear.</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>The noise was extremely loud compared to the sounds of battle all around them.</p><p>It was proof that two very strong powers were clashing against each other.</p><p>&ldquo;...You're persisting better than I expected.&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star&rsquo;s eyes had an odd glow to them.</p><p>He was looking toward Alberu, the black armored knight.</p><p>Alberu started to smile under the helmet.</p><p>He started to speak in a disguised voice.</p><p>&ldquo;How odd.&rdquo;</p><p>But Alberu&rsquo;s gaze instantly sunk.</p><p>On the other hand, his voice seemed quite light as he spoke.</p><p>It was as if he was inspecting something.</p><p>&ldquo;White Star, you seem much weaker than usual today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Pffft.&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm just gathering information. The people on Cale Henituse's side always have something prepared. Shouldn&rsquo;t I confirm what that is first in order to lessen the variables against me?&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu didn&rsquo;t believe him at all.</p><p>The White Star was weaker than usual.</p><p>When the two of them had fought last time... And based on the information he had gathered about the White Star's strength since then...</p><p>He was very weak compared to everything Alberu knew.</p><p>This place should have been extremely advantageous to the White Star.</p><p>That was why Alberu, who had prepared quite a bit to fight here while protecting something at the same time, could not help but be curious about the White Star's current condition.</p><p>But he ended up making eye contact with the White Star who seemed just as curious.</p><p>The White Star&rsquo;s fire sword pointed at something.</p><p>"What kind of weapon is that?&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star did not even have a scratch from all of their clashes even though it was quite narrow.</p><p>The White Star was asking about this weapon and Alberu responded back.</p><p>He had not come here as the crown prince today.</p><p>The only person around him right now was this white thing as well.</p><p>That was why he answered honestly.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the hell do you care?&rdquo;</p><p>He also answered like a rascal.</p><p>&ldquo;White Star, a bastard like you wouldn&rsquo;t know the greatness of an Ex-Grade item.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...What grade?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>That was a great response, sir. I, Taerang, am very happy that Alberu Crossman-nim understands my greatness.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Pffft.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu had a smile underneath his helmet that Cale and Raon would say was quite annoying.</p><p>The White Star could not see that smile properly, but he could imagine it based on Alberu&rsquo;s chuckle.</p><p>Alberu flicked his spear after seeing the White Star start to frown in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on. I'll give you the chance to fight properly with an important person.&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star must have been extremely annoyed by those words as he started to frown even more.</p><p>Even though he was under pressure, Alberu had a refreshed smile on his face as he started to think.</p><p>&rsquo;It really is fun messing with the White Star as Cale Henituse mentioned.&rsquo;</p><p>Just like this...</p><p>&rsquo;Let&rsquo;s drag things out.&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu fixed his grip on his spear.</p><p>It would soon be dawn.</p><p>He started to think about the long day ahead of him.</p> <a href="./chapter605.html" class="chapter-nav">
