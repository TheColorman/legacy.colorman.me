<p>&ldquo;No--!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire that looked like a wild animal with sharp fangs struck down to rip Alberu's body apart.<br>
Taylor was leaning forward so much that it looked as if he might fall over the ledge as he screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your highness!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;S, shoot that with magic immediately!&rdquo;<br>
"What the hell is the Knights Brigade doing?! Open the gates! I need to go out there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A portion of the vassals who had come with Alberu could not hide their astonishment.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...No, this isn&rsquo;t it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s mind was going blank.<br>
Yes, he should not have let his highness go out in the first place.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Even if I had to throw a fit or hold onto him for dear life, I should have made his highness stay inside the castle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Royal Knights Brigade was too busy defending against the wyverns to protect Alberu.<br>
They were trying their best.<br>
However, they could not do anything about the fact that there were not more of them.</p>
<p>&rsquo;If Mr. Choi Han was here......!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Something like this would not have happened if Choi Han was here instead of those knights.<br>
Taylor became weak the moment he had that thought.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...This is the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s weakness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The weakness of the Roan Kingdom that was growing quickly on the Western continent was this.</p>
<p>&rsquo;We only rely on a few select people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taylor hated the fact that he was hoping for Cale to quickly head over even as he realized this weakness.<br>
But there was nothing he could do about it.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I need to do my part......! But there is nothing I can do. I am weak. I am doing my best, but none of it is useful to block the White Star's attack right now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...What do I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taylor started to fall to the ground as he felt his strength leave his body as he could only watch as the White Star's fire sword struck down on Alberu.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>One of his knees touched the floor. The coldness from the floor traveled up his body.<br>
He knelt on one knee and grabbed the ledge and looked toward the sword that was about to slash Alberu.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...His highness who is a high-grade swordsman cannot block that attack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He felt as if his own body was going to rip.<br>
His vision started to turn dark.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Ah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His vision brightened.<br>
Everything started to become bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The questioning gasp turned into a shocked gasp.<br>
He pushed off the ground with his knee while tightening his grip on the ledge.<br>
He subconsciously stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Your highness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;His highness, he...!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, this, what?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not speak properly.<br>
He could not believe it even after seeing it with his own eyes.</p>
<p>His body leaned forward a little more over the edge.<br>
Taylor could hear one of the territory soldiers who was pointing his arrow to prevent the enemy invasion mumble to himself at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taylor said the same thing as if he was out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...It's light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the soldier mentioned, Taylor was looking at light.<br>
Through the fire that looked like it would gobble everything up...in between the white wyvern&rsquo;s cold and large wings...</p>
<p>There was light shooting up.</p>
<p>It was small in size compared to the other two, but it was clearly making its presence known.<br>
Taylor and the soldier were not the only ones blanking out because of the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vassals who had come with Alberu from the capital could not speak after seeing the sight in front of them as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W, what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An administrator who had been urgently called over to deal with supply issues grabbed onto a general and asked.<br>
He almost shouted in an urgent but happy manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W, what is that sword in his highness&rsquo;s hand? General, do you know what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sword made of light.<br>
A sword of light shining as radiantly as the sun was in Alberu&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, I don&rsquo;t know. I've never-&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General did not know the identity of that sword.<br>
It was at that moment.</p>
<p>The Mage Brigade Captain started to speak.</p>
<p>"That is magic! That sword is made of magic!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody looked shocked.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Magic?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means-&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vassal holding onto the General mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A magic swordsman...? His highness is a magic swordsman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vassal then remembered what Alberu had said while looking down at them in the throne room.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Do I look weak to all of you? You are making a grave mistake if you do think that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The General he was holding onto started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...There are a few reasons the military leaders follow his highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;What was he talking about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The vassal looked toward the General.<br>
The General recalled what Alberu had told him before they came here.</p>
<p>&rsquo;People who are already preparing for defeat will not be able to persist. Use me. Raise their morale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had asked Alberu a question about it.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Your highness. I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean by that.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;It&rsquo;s good if you keep not knowing what I mean. I'm just telling you to do that if the time comes when you understand what I mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The General now understood the meaning behind Alberu&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>The allied soldiers who were scared because of the White Star...<br>
He needed to raise their morale.<br>
Only then would they be able to persist.</p>
<p>The General's mind cleared up.<br>
He recalled what Alberu said before he headed out of the castle.</p>
<p>&rsquo;You see, I... I am someone who knows how to do my part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alberu had said that to Marquis Taylor Stan, but the General realized how idly he had been standing here.<br>
That was why he tensed up and started to speak to the people looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the reasons the military leaders follow his highness is because his highness is a highest-grade expert.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Gasp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone gasped.</p>
<p>A highest-grade expert.<br>
That was the level right below sword master.</p>
<p>He was such a talented swordsman?<br>
None of them could hide their shock.</p>
<p>At the same time, they also realized that the spell Alberu cast was quite a high level skill as well.</p>
<p>An odd sensation started from on top of the walls and started to spread throughout the ally formation.<br>
The General immediately shouted toward the Mage Brigade Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain! How much longer for the shield?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;10 minutes! I just need 10 more minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General immediately raised his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;10 minutes! We just need to hold on for ten more minutes! Fire your arrows! We will protect the castle at all costs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shouted toward the soldiers looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look over there! His highness is holding the White Star back! That is why we can do it too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could do it and they needed to do it.<br>
He felt like it was possible.</p>
<p>The odd sensation surrounding the castle walls quickly turned into a burning passion.<br>
The Stan territory's mage who was responsible for messages urgently ran toward Taylor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord-nim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was huffing but did not stop talking as he reported while holding a video communication device.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Henituse territory called saying they will send us reinforcements!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;The Henituse territory? ...Reinforcements from so far away? Reinforcements from the Henituse territory and not young master Cale?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taylor's eyes sparkled while he had multiple questions on his mind.</p>
<p>His heart was beating fast.<br>
An unknown sense of anticipation filled his mind.</p>
<p>&rsquo;We can do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He believed they could do something.</p>
<p>The mage continued his report.</p>
<p>Everybody held their breaths as they waited for his report.</p>
<p>The Henituse territory.</p>
<p>That location was like a sign of victory for the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said that the teleportation magic circle is ready and that they will send the people his highness asked for as soon as they get your permission!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;...His highness prepared them in advance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taylor quickly responded without looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them that we request reinforcements immediately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know what kind of reinforcements they would receive from the Henituse territory since it was not Cale.<br>
However, he was certain about something.</p>
<p>The flow of battle might change.</p>
<p>Just as how the atmosphere around the battlefield was changing right now, he felt that something that could change the flow of battle that determines victory or defeat was approaching.</p>
<p>Taylor realized that he definitely needed to do his part to make that flow turns out to be victorious for their side.<br>
He motioned to the General with his eyes and started to shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Focus on attacking the wyverns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Taylor heard a loud explosion.<br>
He turned his head in shock and then bit down on his lips.</p>
<p>Alberu's sword and the White Star&rsquo;s sword were clashing against each other.</p>
<p>The White Star's fire still seemed as if it would gobble up Alberu&rsquo;s light, but Alberu was persisting.</p>
<p>Taylor suddenly recalled when the northern Indomitable Alliance declared that they would attack the Roan Kingdom.<br>
He recalled how the Roan Kingdom, as the representative of the Western continent, had responded.</p>
<p>&rsquo;The Roan Kingdom is the kingdom with the longest history on the Western continent. We will show them the strength of the survivors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman had been the one to say that.<br>
He had lost his mother at an early age and had lost the king&rsquo;s trust.<br>
He continued to persist throughout it all until he became the influential future king and the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s true sun.</p>
<p>He felt that the Roan Kingdom and Alberu Crossman's life were very similar.<br>
The Roan Kingdom had persisted and persisted until it was finally spreading its wings now.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...There wasn&rsquo;t necessarily only one person to trust and follow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taylor watched Alberu fight in his armor and helmet with the sword of light before turning around.</p>
<p>He had things to do.<br>
His steps were full of energy.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang! Baaaaang-</p>
<p>He heard loud noises behind him again, but he did not turn back.<br>
It was because he trusted Alberu.</p>
<p>Alberu was smiling at that moment.<br>
However, nobody could see it because of his helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...You bastard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, his enemy could not hide his anger as he glared at the helmeted Alberu.<br>
The White Star was shouting in anger and disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bastard... you're a Dark Elf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know how Alberu had hidden it, but he was certain that Alberu was a Dark Elf.<br>
Others may not have seen it, but he had seen how Alberu used dead mana to create light.<br>
The White Star's fire instantly roared toward Alberu&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>However, Alberu&rsquo;s sword of light pushed it back before the fire sword could reach his shoulder.<br>
Alberu started to speak in a laughing tone at that moment.</p>
<p>"A Dark Elf? Who? Me? Should I give you the answer if you're so curious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sounded as if he was making fun of the White Star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sword of light that Alberu had been holding with both hands was moved to his right hand.<br>
Black mana appeared for a moment in his empty left hand before turning into a water spear.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>That spear was quickly flung toward the White Star.<br>
The White Star twisted his body and struck the water spear with his fire sword.</p>
<p>Alberu continued to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a weakling is someone who reveals everything... An expert is someone who hides at least half of what he can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The fire sword cut through the water spear.<br>
It had no issues doing so.</p>
<p>However, a sharp light shot toward him through the exploding water the moment he slashed the water spear.<br>
The White Star could hear Alberu&rsquo;s jovial voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that sense, I am an expert.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You bastard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Alberu and the White Star glared at each other as their swords clashed once again.<br>
In those short few seconds...</p>
<p>The White Star could get a sense of Alberu&rsquo;s level of strength in that short moment.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I didn&rsquo;t give it my all, but he was able to block my attacks multiple times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The crown prince in front of him was a highest-grade expert just under the level of a sword master.</p>
<p>His magic level seemed to be between high-grade and highest-grade as well.<br>
He wasn&rsquo;t a highest-grade mage, but...</p>
<p>&rsquo;...He has an abnormally large amount of dead mana.&rsquo;</p>
<p>How the hell did the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s crown prince have the characteristics of a Dark Elf?<br>
He also had no idea how Alberu could be in possession of so much dead mana.</p>
<p>However, he was certain about one thing.</p>
<p>&rsquo;He&rsquo;s troublesome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale Henituse had an abnormally large number of ancient powers, but his body was weak.<br>
Choi Han was extremely talented with the sword, however, he knew nothing about magic.<br>
Rosalyn was famous for her magic but was not a talented swordsman.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman who was in front of him was not especially strong in any area like those three individuals.<br>
However, he...</p>
<p>&rsquo;His balance is amazing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>...Was balanced.</p>
<p>That was why he was troublesome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Looks like I need to get serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not let a troublesome bastard hold him back.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I was trying to save as much power as possible because I don&rsquo;t know when Cale Henituse might arrive, but...&rsquo;</p>
<p>The White Star had been conserving energy because he didn&rsquo;t know when Cale and his group who should be fighting against the noble bastards on the Eastern continent would come back, but he decided to change his thinking.</p>
<p>Ooooooo-</p>
<p>The area around the White Star started to shake.<br>
The fire sword slowly started to shrink in size.<br>
However, unlike its smaller body, the aura of the sword became much more violent than before.</p>
<p>The White Star started to speak to Alberu without any hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to chat, so I will destroy every part of your body other than your mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to do that to me? Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu was laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The White Star then heard the castle gate starting to open.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>The castle gate opened.<br>
The White Star&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.<br>
Alberu&rsquo;s eyes clouded over at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They're here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu could see the warriors heading out of the castle gate.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>The ground shook every time these warriors took a step.<br>
The leader of these warriors started to speak to the person standing next to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made up our minds to respond to his highness's request, but will you be okay?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be fine, Grandpa Gashan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The berserk Tigers walked out on their hind legs. Their baggy clothes fluttered in the wind.</p>
<p>Duke Deruth had sent a message to Harris Village a moment ago and the Tiger tribe who now lived in Harris Village happily came to the Stan territory after hearing the crown prince's request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be out there with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to Gashan was the Blue Wolf boy Lock with a large shield in his hand.</p> <a href="./chapter520.html" class="chapter-nav">
