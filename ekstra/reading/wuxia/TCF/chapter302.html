The young Dragon's voice reached his ears as he blankly watched the burning fire.</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han! Snap out of it! It's not over yet!&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;That fire is not the end?&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han who was surrounded by multiple layers of silver shields flinched and started to shake. He then lowered his head.</p><p>Screee- boom!<br>Boom- boom!</p><p>The approximately thirty golems.<br>They were slowly melting down one by one.</p><p>He could see something that wasn't melting within the fire as well.<br>The black liquid.<br>The thing that had dyed Choi Han&rsquo;s sword black had not disappeared yet.</p><p>&rsquo;Is Cale-nim&rsquo;s fire useless as well?!&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s eyes clouded over.</p><p>&rsquo;Is it impossible to destroy that chunk of despair in the end?&rsquo;</p><p>It was the moment Choi Han asked that question to himself with concern.<br>Someone from outside the sea of fire started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;It's bad if the fire goes out.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Imperial Prince Adin.</p><p>&rsquo;The black despair will appear if the fire goes out. The Empire&rsquo;s forces will feel even more chaos and become suspicious.&rsquo;</p><p>It would also make this area around Maple Castle desolate, forever turning it into a land of death that the living would have to avoid forever.<br>However, he could not help but want to smile.<br>He rubbed the back of his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;...Cale Henituse.&rdquo;</p><p>Shield. Earth. Water. Fire.<br>The same number of ancient powers as the White Star.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t tell whether the power Cale used to quickly approach him was an ancient power or a spell, however, he knew Cale had at least a minimum of four ancient powers.</p><p>Cale Henituse managed to remain healthy while having four ancient powers.</p><p>&rsquo;How entertaining.&rsquo;</p><p>It really was entertaining.<br>He also wanted to kill Cale.</p><p>He figured something else out as well.</p><p>&ldquo;It was you.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Cale.<br>The unknown power that had foiled all of the Empire's plans until now had to be Cale.<br>Cale Henituse and the Roan Kingdom.</p><p>They pretended to be on good terms with the Empire while aiming for their necks.<br>The pieces of the puzzle finally fell into place.</p><p>He started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately launch magic spells toward Cale Henituse!&rdquo;</p><p>He didn't care about the destroyed golems, the dying pilots, nor the screeching despair.<br>All he was thinking about was the damage control he needed to do once the black despair was revealed.</p><p>&rsquo;Even Cale Henituse will not be able to get rid of the black despair.&rsquo;</p><p>The black despair was still wailing from inside this sea of fire.</p><p>Screeeech- screeeeeeech-</p><p>The dead were still crying.<br>Even formidable powers could not destroy the black despair.</p><p>&rsquo;Then I will kill Cale Henituse and blame it on him.&rsquo;</p><p>There was a way to solve everything as long as he killed Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;Vice Tower Master! Mage Brigade Captain!&rdquo;</p><p>Two people quickly became alert as Adin called for them. However, the other nobles and soldiers were all still out of it.<br>Adin emphasized his order.</p><p>&ldquo;Aim for Cale Henituse! He is currently standing still!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale Henituse was currently floating in place without moving.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear the screams of the dying golem pilots?! We must quickly get revenge for them and the Empire!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Follow his highness's orders! Everybody use the magic stones and launch your strongest attacks!&rdquo;</p><p>Metelona quickly ordered the mages and alchemists.</p><p>&ldquo;Our target is Cale Henituse!&rdquo;</p><p>There was only one target.<br>It was the person who had created this amazing situation.</p><p>Oooooooong- Ooooooooong-</p><p>The mages started to cast spells with shaking hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Only death awaits us if that fire reaches us!&rdquo;</p><p>This comment from the Imperial Prince made everyone start to move.<br>They quickly prepared to launch their spells and were waiting for the command to launch their attacks. Metelona peeked toward the Imperial Prince who raised his hand up.</p><p>Adin&rsquo;s hand coming down would be the signal to launch their attacks.<br>His hand slowly went down.</p><p>He then smiled as he looked toward the battlefield.<br>Why?</p><p>&rsquo;Honte is smiling.&rsquo;</p><p>Honte, the Tower Master&rsquo;s disciple, was smiling. He seemed to be enjoying it.<br>That was why he was certain.</p><p>The Empire was currently not in danger.<br>Cale Henituse would die.</p><p>That was the reason Adin could smile while looking at the fire.</p><p>However, something happened at that moment.<br>Adin heard someone's voice as he lowered his hand. It was someone who had not said anything until now. Honte.<br>Honte started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;...I need to inform the White Star.&rdquo;</p><p>Honte continued to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;This is that power. The power of the forgotten ones. The true ancient powers.&rdquo;</p><p>The Imperial Prince's eyes opened wide at that moment.<br>Things were changing.<br>The sea of fire was changing.<br>He heard Honte's voice again.</p><p>&ldquo;...We must kill him. We must kill him before they are all gathered together.&rdquo;</p><p>He heard another voice at that moment.<br>One of the mages who were preparing to attack sat down and shouted out.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it sir! I, I can&rsquo;t do it!! I can&rsquo;t, a, attack while l, looking at that!&rdquo;</p><p>The mage looked at the sight in front of him and grabbed his shaking hands. His eyes were focused on Cale.</p><p>Things were gathering toward Cale.<br>The black smoke, no, the black smoke skulls headed toward Cale.</p><p>Screeeeeech- screeeeeeech-</p><p>They shrieked as they moved toward Cale.</p><p>Cale didn't care about that as he stood there with his head down.<br>He had this thought every so often.</p><p>&rsquo;How would it feel to cause a shit show and flip everything over as a munchkin?&rsquo; <span id="footnote-ref-5bf2"><a href="#footnote-5bf2">[1]</a></span></p><p>Would it be refreshing?<br>Entertaining?<br>Fun?</p><p>&rsquo;Fun my ass!&rsquo;</p><p>It felt like shit.<br>He looked down at the ground.</p><p>He could see the melting golems.<br>He could also see the alchemist pilots who were burning to death or just blankly sitting there.<br>Furthermore, he could see the disgusting and sticky black despair.<br>The ground became dyed black as that despair touched the ground. The black smoke and the shrieks became even worse.</p><p>Cale lifted his head up.<br>He could see Choi Han standing there in shock as the black smoke surrounded him. Cale let out a chuckle.</p><p>He then got started.</p><p>He decided to properly use this power that he could not control.</p><p>Screeeeeech- screeeeeeech-</p><p>Cale, who was covered in black from the black smoke and surrounded by shrieks, slowly landed on the ground.<br>He stepped in the middle of the golem pilots, the black despair, and the ground that was filled with fire.</p><p>&ldquo;Cale-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han tried to run out of the silver shield in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;That liquid...!&rdquo;</p><p>The black despair. That sticky liquid gathered toward Cale. They gathered together next to Cale, who could not be seen because of the black smoke and shrieks.</p><p>Cale slowly disappeared into that black swamp.<br>He looked as if he would drown in it soon enough.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;He can&rsquo;t become bewitched like me! He can&rsquo;t be tricked by that power!&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han tried to run out of the shield. However, there was an invisible presence preventing him from doing so.</p><p>&ldquo;Raon, don't stop me!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Stupid Choi Han! Did you forget what the human said?!&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han who had been shouting flinched.<br>The young Dragon repeated what Cale had said to Choi Han.</p><p>&ldquo;The human said that he might not be able to control the power! But the human is still okay! There&rsquo;s no issue with his plate either!&rdquo;</p><p>Raon was calmly assessing Cale's status right now.</p><p>&ldquo;The human is just starting!&rdquo;</p><p>The black Dragon could see it.</p><p>He could feel warmth coming from Cale, the person he called, &rsquo;our human.&rsquo;<br>Warmth was one of the reasons people sought out fire.<br>It was something that consoled the cold and the lonely.</p><p>The cold and lonely things were currently gathering around that power.<br>The black smoke and the shrieks.<br>The despairs of the dead people were gathering around Cale's warmth.</p><p>Raon shouted once they had all gathered together.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to disappear! They will disappear!&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;What?&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s vision turned red as he questioned Raon's comment.</p><p>Paaaat-</p><p>A red light shot out.<br>This rose gold colored light blasted out from the center of the sea of fire.</p><p>&ldquo;...The black things-&rdquo;</p><p>The black things, the skulls, and the sticky black liquid were all burning.<br>The black swamp was burning.</p><p>This sight didn't give off as much pressure as the initial sea of fire.<br>However, nobody was able to say anything right now.</p><p>Screeeeeech- screeeeeeech-</p><p>The terrible shrieks. The grotesque cries of unknown origin. They disappeared.</p><p>The black smoke turned white while the black liquid was slowly eaten up by the rose gold light.<br>They could hear something else as that happened.</p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!<br>Aaaaaaah-<br>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!&rdquo;</p><p>They could hear people.<br>They could hear lots of different voices of people crying. Those voices slowly floated up into the air with the now white smoke.</p><p>The sea of fire started to die down as well.<br>The fire was going out on its own.<br>The golems disappeared without a trace.<br>Everything had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The screeches and explosions were all gone. Rosalyn, who was on Maple Castle, raised her head.</p><p>Drip, drip.<br>She could see rose gold dust on the silver shield.</p><p>No, they were ashes.</p><p>Fire only left smoke and ashes once it burned up.<br>She opened her mouth to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;...Purification.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a beautiful sight, as if dust was falling from the sun.</p><p>Plop. Plop.<br>The rose gold ashes fell on the burnt black ground like snow.</p><p>They also landed on someone's shoulders.<br>The rose gold ashes gently landed on Cale Henituse&rsquo;s hair and shoulders.</p><p>Cale lifted his head up.<br>One of his knees buckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Cale-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han caught Cale as he was falling forward. Choi Han&rsquo;s eyes were opened wide.</p><p>Drip.<br>A strand of black blood was running down the corner of Cale&rsquo;s mouth.<br>Choi Han was frowning although the falling rose gold ashes looked beautiful.</p><p>This beautiful and peaceful situation that did not have any loud explosions nor noises required a lot of strength.<br>This silence required a sacrifice in order to attain it.<br>Choi Han knew that this was the case.</p><p>&ldquo;C, Cale-nim-&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s hands were shaking. He tried his best to support Cale in standing up straight.<br>It was at that moment.<br>Cale's mouth started to move.</p><p>Choi Han felt an invisible round front paw pushing his hand away at the same time.</p><ul><li>Choi Han, move!</li></ul><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s eyes opened wide once more after seeing something appear in front of his eyes.</p><p>It was a piece of soggy apple pie.<br>It floated in the air before landing inside Cale&rsquo;s mouth. Choi Han heard a sniffling voice in his mind.</p><ul><li>Human! Our human! You&rsquo;re hungry! I know you're hungry! That&rsquo;s your, &rsquo;I'm hungry,&rsquo; look! I'm relieved! The human feels like he has starved for three days, but he will not die!<br>&ldquo;R, Raon?&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Choi Han was shocked, but soon saw Cale happily eating the apple pie.<br>Cale&rsquo;s face was filled with fatigue from hard work. Cale chewed on the apple pie while his body was slumped over without any strength before shouting out loud.</p><p>&ldquo;Aim for the monsters on land!&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han flinched.<br>He had heard this at the beginning of the battle.<br>Clopeh had said the same thing as he got on the white skeleton bird.</p><p>&rsquo;Fly up!&rsquo;</p><p>And then...</p><p>&rsquo;Aim for the monsters on land!&rsquo;</p><p>People believed that Clopeh was talking about the golems when he said, &rsquo;monsters.&rsquo;<br>Choi Han started to smile.</p><p>He was finally relieved.<br>Cale was okay right now.</p><p>Piiiiiiiiiiiiii- Piiiiiiiiiiiiii-</p><p>He heard the sound of a flute.<br>The white skeleton birds that had escaped high up in the sky had returned.<br>They all headed toward a single direction like an arrow.<br>Clopeh started to shout.</p><p>&ldquo;The Commander has given us an order! Keke, kahahahaha! It is finally time to capture the monster on land!&rdquo;</p><p>The beaks of the white skeleton birds and the swords of the knights were all pointed toward the same spot.</p><p>The monster on land.</p><p>Imperial Prince Adin.</p><p>The truth behind the order Cale had given to Clopeh was aimed at the Empire like an arrow.<br>Cale then smiled brightly before speaking to Choi Han, who was looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale's head was spinning right now.<br>He had used too much power.</p><p>&ldquo;Slap me.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence filled the area for a moment before it finally broke.</p><p>&ldquo;...Excuse me? A, are you okay? You seem confused?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Human, are you okay? Your plate is fine! Do you go crazy when you use your power now?</li></ul><p>Cale calmly answered back when Choi Han and Raon were truly concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m going to faint.&rdquo;</p><p>It would be bad if he fainted right now.</p><hr><div id="footnote-5bf2"><p>1.
