<p>He needed to first figure out today's date.</p><p>&rsquo;I also need to check who is here.&rsquo;</p><p>He needed to figure out the people who would fight based on the present and his information of the future.</p><p>And most importantly.</p><p>&rsquo;I need to change myself first.&rsquo;</p><p>He needed to get his abilities awakened.</p><p>However, an ability awakening was something nobody could predict.</p><p>Cale&rsquo;s abilities were only awakened after he started working for his company.</p><p>That was why, realistically speaking, it would be close to impossible for Cale to awaken his future abilities as he pleased.</p><p>&rsquo;...But I&rsquo;ve experienced the sensation that comes with abilities being awakened.&rsquo;</p><p>It felt as if he was seeing a new world.</p><p>If he thinks about that sensation and does similar things as to when his abilities actually awakened, couldn't he potentially get them awakened sooner?</p><p>&rsquo;...It&rsquo;s fine if my abilities don&rsquo;t awaken while I'm at the central shelter, but it would be great to have them when I go up against the unranked monster.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale's expression stiffened and Grandma Kim tightly grabbed Cale&rsquo;s hand that was over his stomach.</p><p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p><p>Cale then saw a yellow light surround his stomach.</p><p>He subconsciously started to speak with urgency.</p><p>&ldquo;Grandma, I'm okay!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale could feel the pain in his stomach disappear.</p><p>Any bruises or injuries on his stomach probably healed right away.</p><p>This was grandma&rsquo;s healing ability.</p><p>&ldquo;...How can you use your power for such a useless thing?&rdquo;</p><p>Grandma Kim's abilities could only heal external injuries and had limited uses per week.</p><p>She could use it as many times as she wanted for small injuries such as bruises, but she had a strict limit for injuries such as bone fractures or significant blood loss.</p><p>The amount of healing power necessary was different based on the type of injury.</p><p>That was why Park Jin Tae wanted Grandma Kim to use her powers for healing his precious attack team members who could fight against monsters.</p><p>Grandma Kim smiled gently after hearing Cale's comment.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not useless, it is important.&rdquo;</p><p>The grandma got up and motioned for Cale to get up as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Rok Soo. Let's go inside.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale slowly raised his body after seeing that warm smile.</p><p>He didn't have any pain anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you stupid idiot!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hyung!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale turned toward the voice calling out to him.</p><p>He could see people rushing out of the shelter.</p><p>Two students, one who seemed to be in college and the other in high school, rushed over and started to support Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, are you okay?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hyung, are you okay?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>These people were here as well.</p><p>Lee Jin Joo. Lee Seung Won.</p><p>These two were siblings and ability users.</p><p>&rsquo;Of course, they have abilities that other ability users look down on.&rsquo;</p><p>Their abilities were seen as useless abilities right now.</p><p>&rsquo;...And these two.&rsquo;</p><p>They also died.</p><p>Cale suddenly felt as if someone was clenching his heart and found it hard to breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm fine.&rdquo;</p><p>But his face and voice did not show any signs of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Aigoo. Look at you acting all tough!&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Jin Joo snorted, but her eyes were full of concern as she checked to make sure Kim Rok Soo was okay.</p><p>Cale gently pushed Lee Jin Joo and Lee Seung Won away and walked in front of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go inside.&rdquo;</p><p>The siblings blankly looked at Cale for a moment before shaking their heads and following him inside.</p><p>&ldquo;You should just let us support you. Why are you walking so slowly?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hyung, we're going to go back in first! We came in the middle of work!&rdquo;</p><p>The people inside the central shelter all had work they needed to complete every day.</p><p>Of course, those jobs were only given to people who had Park Jin Tae's approval.</p><p>Kim Rok Soo did not have his approval, which was why they always tried to start shit with him in the name of running errands.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn't it so nice to see them relying on each other?&rdquo;</p><p>Grandma Kim smiled while looking at the siblings who were walking away.</p><p>Cale looked at the siblings instead of responding.</p><p>It made him think of On and Hong.</p><p>&ldquo;Grandma.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;<br>"What is today's date?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p><p>Grandma Kim looked at him with confusion while wondering why he was asking such a thing before answering in a soft voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Today is the 24th.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;October?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes? Why are you suddenly asking about the date?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Just because.&rdquo;</p><p>October 24th.</p><p>Cale recalled today's date.</p><p>&ldquo;...Fuck.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Hey, Rok Soo.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I'm sorry. I just suddenly thought of something that made me angry.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled toward Grandma Kim who was looking at him with concern after hearing his coarse language.</p><p>Grandma Kim, who had not seen Rok Soo smile in a while, opened her eyes wide in shock for a moment before gently smiling and nodding her head.</p><p>Cale repeated the word in his mind as he continued to walk next to her.</p><p>&rsquo;Fuck fuck fuck!&rsquo;</p><p>The only thing on his mind was swearing.</p><p>In one day...</p><p>During day time on October 25th...</p><p>Central shelters around the world will be destroyed.</p><p>It was the start date of the incident that would fill the hearts of the people who barely started to adjust to the changes since the cataclysm with despair.</p><p>&rsquo;I only have one day?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale walked into the central shelter.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm going to go work now too.&rdquo;</p><p>Grandma Kim headed for her post while Cale took in the sight inside the central shelter.</p><p>&rsquo;It really is the early stages.&rsquo;</p><p>There were a lot of different people doing their jobs on the first floor of the building.</p><p>None of them paid any attention to Kim Rok Soo.</p><p>&rsquo;They&rsquo;re all busy doing their best to survive.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale continued to walk and headed for his spot.</p><p>There was a fake wall that came up to his waist once he got past the entrance area.</p><p>He could see people pretty much right next to one another once he got past that fake wall.</p><p>These people were in a similar situation as Kim Rok Soo.</p><p>They had not awakened their abilities and didn&rsquo;t have any skills nor techniques that were necessary in the world right now.</p><p>'Of course, people will realize that is not the case later on when society is revitalized.&rsquo;</p><p>They were also doing the work assigned to them.</p><p>Step step.</p><p>Cale walked past them and kept moving.</p><p>The second floor of the central shelter was where the ability users and useful humans resided.</p><p>The Lee siblings had a bedroom on the second floor.</p><p>&rsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too shabby to call it a bedroom or lodging.&rsquo;</p><p>It was a time when any spot that allowed someone to escape the rain and wind was considered lodging and any nice cloth they could find was used as blankets.</p><p>They were lucky to find enough food for one day.</p><p>&rsquo;The Park Jin Tae group did share though.&rsquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae and his lackeys went out to find food for the group.</p><p>They did it while dodging and running away from monsters.</p><p>&rsquo;They did fight against some, but unlike the future, this was a time when even grade 3 monsters were difficult to handle.&rsquo;</p><p>People had awakened their abilities but still could not use them properly.</p><p>Abilities could be used for many things, and this was called 'development.&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;But right now is not the time to attempt that.&rsquo;</p><p>The foundations of society had crumbled.</p><p>There wasn't even any electricity.</p><p>They were surrounded by darkness every night.</p><p>The only things that kept it from being completely dark at night were the fireplaces around the shelter that had fires that never went out.</p><p>Cale looked down at his hands as he walked.</p><p>&rsquo;They&rsquo;re so skinny.&rsquo;</p><p>His body was extremely skinny right now.</p><p>Park Jin Tae's lackeys only gave just enough so that they did not die.</p><p>&rsquo;That&rsquo;s the only way they can spread it out to everybody inside this shelter.&rsquo;</p><p>It was not easy to find food.</p><p>Kim Rok Soo managed to survive on the bare minimum.</p><p>&rsquo;The people of value received more food.&rsquo;</p><p>That was why the ability users who had good relationships with Kim Rok Soo would offer him some of their shares from time to time.</p><p>&rsquo;...The world is not bleak.&rsquo;</p><p>Even though the times seemed hopeless, the hearts of the people living through it had not gone completely dark.</p><p>That was why Cale didn't think Park Jin Tae was a bad person.</p><p>&rsquo;There are many places that don't even give out food like this.&rsquo;</p><p>A lot of people didn't care whether others starved to death.</p><p>In such a situation, although Park Jin Tae looked down and messed with people like Kim Rok Soo, he still gave them enough food to survive.</p><p>&rsquo;Well, he does beat up resistant people like me though. No, he just really hated me.&rsquo;</p><p>But he still gave out enough so that their legs would have enough strength to run away if they ever ran into a monster.</p><p>The bastard had turned this central shelter into his own kingdom, but he still kept himself humane.</p><p>He did not cross the line a fellow human should not cross.</p><p>He at least gave them their share of food.</p><p>Cale had realized something about it once he became older.</p><p>&rsquo;The fact that Park Jin Tae pushed the skillful people up might have been the reason this system was able to be maintained.&rsquo;</p><p>All societal systems had been destroyed at that time.</p><p>How many ability users would want to share the food that they worked so hard to find?</p><p>But since Park Jin Tae treated the ability users well, they stayed with this food sharing system.</p><p>&rsquo;And Park Jin Tae is currently a very strong attack-type ability user.&rsquo;</p><p>There was a reason team leader Lee Soo Hyuk left the place to Park Jin Tae.</p><p>Park Jin Tae was a very strong dealer and a decent tanker.</p><p>Lee Chul Min and the others who followed Park Jin Tae were not bad for the early stages either.</p><p>&rsquo;I will use Park Jin Tae.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale was slowly planning things in his mind.</p><p>&rsquo;There&rsquo;s also Grandma Kim, Jin Joo noona, and Seung Won.&rsquo;</p><p>There were also many other people he needed for this task.</p><p>Cale returned to his spot.</p><p>Kim Rok Soo&rsquo;s spot in this central shelter...</p><p>It was at the edge of the first floor.</p><p>It was right next to a crumbling ceiling.</p><p>It was right by the back door of the first floor.</p><p>&ldquo;...The rain leaked here.&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Rok Soo&rsquo;s spot was the only spot in the building where rain leaked through the cracked ceiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you talking to yourself like that?&rdquo;</p><p>He heard a voice at that moment.</p><p>It was a husky and aged man's voice.</p><p>&ldquo;You chose that spot.&rdquo;</p><p>That was the case.</p><p>Cale had chosen this spot as that person mentioned.</p><p>Park Jin Tae placed the ability-less Cale to the first floor and he chose this leaking spot as his spot.</p><p>"What's wrong? Do you suddenly want to move elsewhere? What happened to pretending like you were sacrificing yourself for the others?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale sighed and turned his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey mister. Why don't you go elsewhere if you want to talk shit?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Kekeke! Who says I'm talking shit?!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale looked toward the middle-aged man lying on the next spot.</p><p>There was nothing under his knees.</p><p>He was one of the people that team leader Lee Soo Hyuk had saved.</p><p>His name was Jang Man Soo.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! I heard you got beat up by Park Jin Tae and his gang. Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Jang Man Soo raised his neck and leaned on the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Those terrible bastards. Where is there even to hit such a skinny kid? They&rsquo;ll be punished by the heavens!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It's fine. Grandma healed me.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale looked next to Jang Man Soo... and sat down in his spot.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm? Grandma did? Aigoo, why does that grandma care about you so much? Why did she heal a good for nothing like you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you saying you're upset that I got healed?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh come on~ Of course not. Kehehe! I just said it! It was a joke, a joke!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale quietly looked at Jang Man Soo who was joking with him.</p><p>Jang Man Soo.</p><p>He was someone who lost his entire family because of the cataclysm.</p><p>He had a wife and two kids and was on his way to work when it happened.</p><p>He barely managed to get back to his house only to see that all of them were already dead.</p><p>He saw the monster that had killed his family there.</p><p>He apparently ran for his life from monsters to get to his house.</p><p>There had only been one thing on his mind as he did that.</p><p>He was thinking that his family was alive at home and that he would take his family somewhere safe.</p><p>But he charged toward the monster the moment he saw that his family was dead.</p><p>The thought of running away never ever crossed his mind.</p><p>He just felt as if he could only continue to live if he ripped the monster in front of him to pieces.</p><p>The monster took both of his legs and Jang Man Soo was planning on dying.</p><p>He didn't think there was a reason to live in this world without his family.</p><p>But the team leader saved him and Jang Man Soo was someone who was barely alive and living on.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey mister.&rdquo;<br>"What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale quietly observed him before lowering his body.</p><p>He got closer to Jang Man Soo.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey mister.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are you suddenly acting like this, you punk?&rdquo;</p><p>As Jang Man Soo looked toward Kim Rok Soo who was acting differently than normal with confusion...</p><p>Cale quietly whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Please help me out.&rdquo;</p><p>Jang Man Soo looked confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Me? You're talking to me? What help can I be? Did you go crazy after getting beaten up?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mister.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale whispered quietly so that nobody else could hear.</p><p>&ldquo;Your ability awakened not too long ago, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>Jang Man Soo's pupils started to shake.</p><p>His jaw dropped and he looked astonished.</p><p>Cale started to smile while looking at his reaction.</p><p>It seemed to be a sad smile.</p><p>Jang Man Soo also died in the past when the central shelter disappeared.</p><p>He died fighting.</p><p>&rsquo;Kehehe! I'm relieved! This time, I'm going first after protecting people!&rsquo;</p><p>His ability apparently awakened not long before the central shelter was destroyed.</p><p>His memory of Jang Man Soo remained with Kim Rok Soo that once he became Cale...</p><p>The first thing he chose to get was a shield.</p><p>&ldquo;Mister, your ability is a shield, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Jang Man Soo stiffened up and could not say anything.</p><p>&rsquo;How did he realize that my ability awakened?&rsquo;</p><p>People didn't look different even after awakening their ability.</p><p>That was why there was no way to tell unless they saw the person using the ability or the person told them.</p><p>There were some ability users whose appearances changed with it, but Jang Man Soo's case wasn&rsquo;t like that.</p><p>&rsquo;But Kim Rok Soo realized that? And he knows what my ability is as well?&rsquo;</p><p>How could he not be astonished in such a situation?</p><p>Cale whispered to him.</p><p>"The central shelter will be destroyed soon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;W, what?!&rdquo;</p><p>His mouth that had closed back in shock dropped once more at this even more shocking comment.</p><p>Jang Man Soo raised his voice with an extremely shocked expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Shh.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale quieted him down and whispered very quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;And I know where the new central shelter will appear.&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;What is this punk saying right now?&rsquo;</p><p>Jang Man Soo was looking at Kim Rok Soo as if he was looking at someone he had just met.</p><p>&ldquo;Mister.&rdquo;</p><p>But Kim Rok Soo's eyes were more serious than ever.</p><p>One word after another.</p><p>Each word that Kim Rok Soo said to him struck Jang Man Soo&rsquo;s ear.</p><p>&ldquo;I plan on letting everybody here move to the new central shelter without dying.&rdquo;</p><p>Jang Man Soo barely managed to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;You- you, how do you know about those......?&rdquo;</p><p>Smile.</p><p>Kim Rok Soo started to smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I got an ability too.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a very strong ability where he knew the future.</p> <a href="./chapter556.html" class="chapter-nav">
