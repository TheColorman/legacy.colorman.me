<p>&ldquo;...That......&rdquo;</p><p>Over half of the White Star's face was covered, but his expression was clearly visible.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to lug that away...? Right now?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked shocked and full of disbelief.</p><p>The tip of a white spear was pointed toward him.</p><p>The owner of the spear was smiling as he responded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Right now. Right in front of your eyes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Ha!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? I can&rsquo;t do that?&rdquo;</p><p>Although Alberu&rsquo;s face was covered by the helmet as he tilted his head to the side...</p><ul><li>You said it very well so that it sounds annoying, sir.</li></ul><p>It was as Taerang said.</p><p>&ldquo;Pffft.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu just snorted.</p><p>&rsquo;There&rsquo;s no reason I can&rsquo;t do that. Who cares if the black orb is the sealed god's? Will I face a god's rage if I steal it? So what?&rsquo;</p><p>He just had to take care of that anger as well.</p><p>Why would he care about a god&rsquo;s rage when he had every intention of smacking the back of a god's head?</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s better than struggling to fight here while protecting Cale Henituse.&rsquo;</p><p>They needed to protect this black orb for the whole day.</p><p>Why would they fight a difficult battle here in enemy territory while protecting the black orb?</p><p>&rsquo;What if someone gets hurt while we do that?&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu found it difficult to fight against the White Star right now with both Cale and Choi Han not being here.</p><p>&rsquo;Although I came here not as the crown prince but as his sworn brother...&rsquo;</p><p>It didn't change the fact that he was Alberu Crossman. He was the crown prince of the Roan Kingdom.</p><p>He was sure that one of the White Star&rsquo;s subordinates had contacted the other kingdoms on the Eastern continent to inform them that the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s crown prince has invaded the Endable Kingdom the moment he appeared.</p><p>The kingdoms of the Eastern continent that have created an alliance were bound to show some kind of gesture as a result.</p><p>They would either send reinforcements to the Endable Kingdom or put pressure on the Roan Kingdom.</p><p>&rsquo;That is why this is a fight against time.&rsquo;</p><p>Both sides were in a fight against time right now.</p><p>&rsquo;This battle will become more difficult for us the longer we stay here. On the other hand, the enemies will benefit the longer they keep us here.&rsquo;</p><p>In that case, it was better to take it and run.</p><p>&rsquo;We will head back to the Roan Kingdom on the Western continent.&rsquo;</p><p>That was a place where Alberu Crossman would have the upper hand over the White Star and be extremely strong even without fighting.</p><p>&rsquo;But to give that up and fight here? Why? Why make it difficult for ourselves? We need to head to a safe spot first if all of us are to survive.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale had the same thoughts that Alberu was having.</p><p>&rsquo;My goodness. My dongsaeng and I have very similar thoughts in this regard.&rsquo;</p><p>That was why he didn&rsquo;t want to let Cale be a slacker in the future.</p><p>He wanted to keep Cale next to him as a Prime Minister or a Commander.</p><p>&rsquo;But I'll still make sure to let him be a slacker. That unlucky bastard. I can at least do that much for him.&rsquo;</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>Baaaaang---!</p><p>Through the hole in the white castle created from the signal flare...</p><p>White light burst out of that hole and shot up into the air.</p><p>A black aura followed behind it.</p><p>&rsquo;Those are?!&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu started to frown.</p><p>He was sure that they were the powers of light and darkness used by the Lion King and the Bear King.</p><p>The two of their powers were headed toward Mary&rsquo;s Flying Skeleton Brigade and her black threads.</p><p>Smile.</p><p>But Alberu was still smiling.</p><p>As the light and darkness shot up...</p><p>&ldquo;I've been expecting this.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary&rsquo;s robe started to flutter.</p><p>A thoroughly woven spider web that was not the net to grab the black orb appeared and crashed into the light and darkness as if it was a shield.</p><p>It was as if the dead mana net was falling down to suppress the light and darkness from above.</p><p>Alberu knew how strong this net that did not look very sturdy actually was.</p><p>&rsquo;He said that she was as strong as Choi Han.&rsquo;</p><p>This necromancer was said to be able to defeat Choi Han five out of ten battles.</p><p>She was said to be the strongest warrior but just had not had the right conditions to fight properly.</p><p>&rsquo;That&rsquo;s what Cale Henituse told me.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale had said that they must bring Mary with them to the large-scale battle against the White Star on the Eastern continent.</p><p>&rsquo;The necromancer wanted it as well.&rsquo;</p><p>She had wanted to fight.</p><p>She had been preparing for three months to fight.</p><p>Of course, Mary was not strong enough to take on both the Lion King and the Bear King at the same time.</p><p>That was why that net shield would not be able to block both powers.</p><p>But Alberu knew what would happen.</p><p>He knew that another strong individual would finally start to unleash her power.</p><p>Baaaaaang---!</p><p>The net shield... The moment it crashed into the light and darkness...</p><p>Alberu could see a red strand of light shooting up from below.</p><p>It looked like fire. No, this light shot up like a radiant sun as it shot up to attack the light and the darkness.</p><p>&rsquo;...Rosalyn!&rsquo;</p><p>It was Rosalyn&rsquo;s power.</p><p>Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip-!</p><p>The black net shield started to rip.</p><p>The radiant red mana disappeared as well.</p><p>However, the light and darkness had disappeared after being suppressed from above and below at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;I am going back to grabbing it.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary's Flying Skeleton Brigade and net quickly started to move toward the black orb again.</p><p>The Bear King was watching this from inside the white castle.</p><p>&ldquo;My goodness. They planned quite an interesting show.&rdquo;</p><p>Bear King Sayeru turned toward Rosalyn as he sarcastically said that.</p><p>Shhh.</p><p>The aftershock of the explosion removed Rosalyn's hood at that moment.</p><p>Flutter-</p><p>They could see a necklace once the hood was removed.</p><p>It was a large and funny looking necklace that looked as if a child had tied large pieces of candy together to play around.</p><p>But their expressions stiffened once they saw the necklace.</p><p>This was especially true for the black mages stationed inside the castle.</p><p>&ldquo;H, holy shit-!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Magic stones-, how can she have highest-grade magic stones around her neck like that?!&rdquo;</p><p>The funny-looking things on the necklace that resembled large pieces of candy were all highest-grade magic stones.</p><p>They were all the best of the best highest-grade magic stones at that.</p><p>Rosalyn had an elegant smile on her face.</p><p>Alberu had told her something yesterday.</p><p>&rsquo;That is what Cale told me. &rsquo;What is the point of saving them? Are you going to eat them?&rsquo; ...He&rsquo;s such a disrespectful little punk.&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;I guess it makes sense to use them rather than to eat them as he mentioned.&rsquo;</p><p>This accessory of hers was something she liked more than anything else. She caressed the highest-grade magic stone necklace as she gracefully started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I can fight without worrying about money because the Roan crown is supporting me like this.&rdquo;</p><p>This was actually from Alberu&rsquo;s personal fortune.</p><p>He had called it an emergency fund for potential situations that may arise.</p><p>Because of that...</p><p>&ldquo;I should do it properly, right?&rdquo;</p><p>A light shot toward her as she said that.</p><p>&ldquo;I will make you shut that damn mouth of yours!&rdquo;</p><p>It was Sayeru's light arrow.</p><p>But Rosalyn quickly saw someone&rsquo;s shadow.</p><p>It was Lock.</p><p>&ldquo;...No way.&rdquo;</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>A large spear appeared in front of Rosalyn and blocked the light.</p><p>Ooooooooong-</p><p>There was white smoke coming from the large shield once the explosion settled, but it did not even have a scratch.</p><p>It deserved to be a magic shield created by Lord Sheritt for defense.</p><p>The Wolf holding that shield was now charging toward Bear King Sayeru.</p><p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p><p>The ground shook every time he took a step.</p><p>It was to be expected as this already bulky body was holding a large spear as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Move! I will take care of this bastard!&rdquo;</p><p>Sayeru shouted and the enemy troops quickly stepped back.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! His strength-&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Step back! You can&rsquo;t let him slam into you!&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, there were already individuals who had been sent flying by the shield.</p><p>Lock's strength was close to being Herculean Strength.</p><p>But Lock didn&rsquo;t care about anything else as he was focused strictly on Sayeru.</p><p>&rsquo;I am filled with strength right now.&rsquo;</p><p>Of course, he had noticed that his body was oddly filled with a ton of strength right now.</p><p>Was it because of all of the training he had done with Lord Sheritt until now?</p><p>Was it from his anger about why it had to be the Wolf tribe that suffered such terrible misfortunes?</p><p>If it was neither of those, then was it because of his desperation to save everyone?</p><p>Lock didn&rsquo;t know the answer and just focused on what Rosalyn had quietly whispered to him during that last short explosion.</p><p>&rsquo;We pretend to fight and then retreat. You remember, right?&rsquo;</p><p>He knew.</p><p>&rsquo;The important thing right now is to save everyone.&rsquo;</p><p>Of course he knew.</p><p>&rsquo;And smacking them from the back. You know what I mean, right?&rsquo;</p><p>He knew very well and he liked it very much.</p><p>It was a plan that made it seem as if young master Cale was with them even though he wasn't.</p><p>Peek.</p><p>Lock could see brightly burning red mana heading toward the Lion King.</p><p>The middle-aged man... Dorph was stepping forward to take on Rosalyn.</p><p>Rosalyn saw him and stoically commented.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard that you use a Darkness Elemental? Hmm. Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll take it on.&rdquo;</p><p>It was to be expected of his older sister.</p><p>Lock almost chuckled after hearing Rosalyn's calm voice.</p><p>But he could not laugh.</p><p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>They were each taking on the Bear King and the Lion King respectively, but there were many other strong individuals in here as well.</p><p>There were so many that he couldn't even count all of them.</p><p>&ldquo;We must destroy the black shield! That is our number one priority!&rdquo;</p><p>It was a knight on top of a black horse.</p><p>It was the Black Knight, Count Hubesha.</p><p>There was the old Dark Elf that had left to take over the black castle in the Forest of Darkness... This woman was the other Count other than Count Mock.</p><p>She continued to shout while pointing toward the black shield as numerous attacks were already heading toward it.</p><p>Baaaaang! Bang! Baaaaang!</p><p>Lock started to frown.</p><p>Raon might be a Dragon but this was an endless volley of attacks.</p><p>&rsquo;Will Raon-nim be able to deal with this situation?&rsquo;</p><p>The moment Lock had that question...</p><ul><li>Hey Rosalyn, Lock! Can you see it? I truly am a great and mighty Dragon! My shield is as strong as our human&rsquo;s shield! Hehe! I&rsquo;ll create a teleportation magic circle to transfer the children before stealing the sculptures!</li></ul><p>Lock ended up chuckling after hearing Raon&rsquo;s calm voice that resembled a certain someone.</p><p>And then he was certain.</p><p>&rsquo;Everybody will do a good job.&rsquo;</p><p>Lock started to think about the others who should be fighting outside the palace.</p><p>As for one of those other allies...</p><p>Smile.</p><p>Alberu had a thick smile on his face as he watched the White Star rush past him.</p><p>The White Star was not attacking him.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re in a rush?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have no more time to play around with you!&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star started to frown after hearing Alberu&rsquo;s mocking tone and kicked off the ground.</p><p>Crackle-</p><p>He then swung his fire sword once he was in the air.</p><p>Fire shot forward from the sword as if it was a boomerang.</p><p>It was naturally headed toward Mary.</p><p>&ldquo;I will block it.&rdquo;</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>A black wyvern&rsquo;s tail smashed into the fire boomerang.</p><p>Crackle. Crack.</p><p>The majority of the tailbone crumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p>Smile.</p><p>As the White Star started to smile in response...</p><p>Mary&rsquo;s hand showed itself from underneath the robe. On her hand that looked as if black threads were creating a painting on it... Her thumb and index finger snapped together without any hesitation.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Many things started to appear through the Endable Kingdom's sinkhole along with that quiet noise.</p><p>&ldquo;I have many more.&rdquo;</p><p>Black skeleton wyverns that had yet to fly up were looking down into the sinkhole ready to flap their wings at any moment.</p><p>They looked as if they were considering the White Star to be prey that they could hunt at any moment.</p><p>&ldquo;All I need to do is destroy them.&rdquo;</p><p>The smile on the White Star's face did not disappear.</p><p>The fire sword started to swing all around him.</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>Numerous fire boomerangs appeared and started to charge toward the net from multiple directions.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm!&rdquo;</p><p>Mary immediately sent the black skeleton wyverns flying to block the fire boomerangs.</p><p>&ldquo;Keke.&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star sneered at her before twisting his body mid-air and heading toward the black orb that was surrounded by Eruhaben's gold shield.</p><p>His eyes were quickly moving around to locate Eruhaben, whom he had not been able to locate since a few moments ago. His feet were quickly moving toward Cale Henituse.</p><p>&rsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter where the ancient Dragon is located.&rsquo;</p><p>Squeeze.</p><p>His hand clenched tightly around his sword.</p><p>He was giving off the will to slash through that shield and black orb at any moment.</p><p>&ldquo;It might make things a little more difficult, but even if it means we need to make some changes to our plans...&rdquo;</p><p>Definitely.</p><p>&ldquo;I will kill Cale Henituse.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Says who?&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Alberu Crossman's voice below him.</p><p>&ldquo;Pffft.&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star responded while laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Me.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu Crossman could not defeat him if he used his full strength.</p><p>That was why he didn&rsquo;t need to pay much attention to Alberu.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to ignore me.&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Alberu&rsquo;s voice again but just ignored it.</p><p>There was no need to listen to him as he was in a rush.</p><p>The White Star&rsquo;s body headed toward the black orb without any hesitation.</p><p>He was only wary of a surprise attack from the ancient Dragon, Eruhaben.</p><p>Yes, that was what he had thought.</p><p>However...</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star let out a grown.</p><p>His gaze headed down.</p><p>He looked toward his right foot.</p><p>Chhhhhhh-!</p><p>There was a white chain wrapped around his ankle.</p><p>It felt as if it was trying to squeeze his ankle until it exploded.</p><p>"Where-?!&rdquo;</p><p>Where had such an attack come from?</p><p>&rsquo;I didn't even feel any mana nor anything!&rsquo;</p><p>The White Star's eyes followed the chain until he saw a black helmet.</p><p>He could also see the white spear in the black armored person&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Chhhhhhh-</p><p>The white spear...</p><p>The head of the spear had split open and released the chain.</p><ul><li>You are finally using me, sir.</li></ul><p>Taerang&rsquo;s voice was still emotionless, but it sounded oddly happy.</p><p>Taerang continued to speak to Alberu.</p><ul><li><p>The Unbreakable Spear. I will show you the perfect form of the &rsquo;Omnipotent Weapon,&rsquo; the first of my three special abilities.</p></li><li><p>Alberu Crossman-nim.</p></li><li><p>As long as you wish, any weapon in this world... No, please let me correct myself. You are able to use any weapon that exists on Earth 3.</p></li></ul><p>Alberu pulled the spear.</p><p>That made the chain tighten around the White Star&rsquo;s ankle, making him unable to move.</p><ul><li>Sir, as you already know... A human without any weaknesses will always win. This weapon that cannot be ranked... This EX-Grade Unbreakable Spear will turn you into a warrior without any weaknesses.</li></ul><p>The corners of Alberu&rsquo;s lips went up more with everything Taerang said to him.</p><p>He pulled the White Star&rsquo;s ankle as he nonchalantly commented.</p><p>&ldquo;Like I would let you do as you please.&rdquo;</p><p>There was no way he would let that happen.</p><p>If anything was going to happen...</p><p>&ldquo;We have to do things as I please.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu Crossman had a smile on his face that Raon would call wicked if he saw it.</p> <a href="./chapter610.html" class="chapter-nav">
