At the same time, his intuition as someone who has read a large number of fantasy novels was telling him something else.</p><p>&rsquo;There&rsquo;s no way a Dragon half-blood is weak.<br>Aren&rsquo;t most main characters or the final bosses in fantasy novels Dragon half-bloods?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale's expression turned serious.<br>He immediately started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han! Mary! Again!&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han immediately stood back up and kicked off of the wyvern&rsquo;s back in order to jump into the air. The original wyvern that Choi Han had been riding on returned to support him.</p><p>&ldquo;Raon, make the shield stronger so that that bastard cannot run away!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Alright, human!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale saw the silver shield becoming thicker as he looked around the water.<br>The ships were still moving while following the roaring ocean. However, he noticed something weird.</p><p>&rsquo;...There&rsquo;s something there.&rsquo;</p><p>The ships by the shore had not come out into deep waters ever since his shield appeared.<br>They could not make the decision to go out into the deep waters after seeing Cale's shield and the roaring ocean.</p><p>However, all of the large ships by the shores were now coming out.<br>The largest of those ships was moving toward the shield without any hesitation now.</p><p>It was as if they had been waiting for that mage and now felt confident to fight again.</p><p>&ldquo;Raon, I leave it to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale turned his head. Choi Han said those words to Raon before trying to head back down with the wyvern.<br>However, he had no choice but to change directions.</p><p>Snap. Snap. Snap.<br>The dumb-looking mage snapped his fingers a few times.</p><p>Snap. Snap.<br>A small thunderbolt appeared in the air every time he did that.</p><p>&rsquo;Is it an attack?&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han could not move carelessly as he noticed the mage staring at Cale and him. Raon was there, but he was still worried. He cautiously observed the tiny thunderbolts.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes then opened wide.</p><p>The small thunderbolts started to shoot down.</p><p>Baaaaang!<br>Baaaaaang!</p><p>They landed in the water between the ships. They nimbly dodged the large ships and made loud noises as they entered the water. They were causing waves that were much larger when the shield had appeared.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is he shooting the thunderbolts into the water......&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han could not hide his confusion. Why was he making it difficult for his allies instead of just attacking?<br>However, he could hear Raon's angry voice coming from above him.</p><p>&ldquo;How dare he!&rdquo;</p><p>His voice soon sounded concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;Human!&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Human? Cale-nim?&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han lifted his head up in order to look toward Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale was holding back a groan. He was covering his mouth with his hands, but there was black blood flowing out of it. Although he could not see the invisible Raon, he could still hear his angry voice.</p><p>&ldquo;He broke my whirlpool and our human's whirlpool with the thunderbolts!&rdquo;</p><p>The thunderbolts were like spears as they pierced and destroyed the whirlpools one by one.<br>Choi Han could see Cale continuing to cough up black blood. That black blood gave him the chills.</p><p>Choi Han made eye contact with Cale at that moment.<br>Cale&rsquo;s gaze was strong and confident.<br>It was giving him an order.</p><p>&rsquo;Follow my command.&rsquo;</p><p>That seemed to be what it was saying.<br>The wyvern started to fly down even without being told to do so. Choi Han could see an area that was still being struck by the tiny thunderbolts.<br>He slowly headed down toward it.</p><p>Choi Han started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry over.&rdquo;</p><p>The wyvern seemed to have been waiting for him to say that, as it shot toward the mage like an arrow.<br>Choi Han did not pay attention to the small thunderbolts raining down around him. The wyvern and Mary would dodge them for him. In return, he raised his aura to the maximum strength he could currently muster.</p><p>Light slowly disappeared as the sword became almost completely black.<br>Choi Han made eye contact with the enemy with that sword in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I was bored from just watching. How wonderful. I didn&rsquo;t expect such entertaining people to be here.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han kicked off the wyvern&rsquo;s head the moment he heard the mage's voice.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He slammed down onto the deck the mage was standing on.<br>The wyvern urgently changed directions. It then opened up its bony mouth and revealed its sharp fangs.</p><p>Crack!<br>It ripped off the sail of the ship next to them.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Black Bone Wyvern then stomped on the ship. Choi Han shot forward with his black aura at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;What an interesting human.&rdquo;</p><p>The mage opened up his arms as if he was welcoming Choi Han. He then flicked his finger.</p><p>Click.<br>A clicking sound could be heard.</p><p>Choi Han lifted his arms high up in the air before striking down with his sword.</p><p>Bang!<br>The black aura crashed against the small mana orb.<br>However, neither of them exploded.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han raised his black aura even more as he pushed back against the mana orb. However, the mana orb was not pushed back at all as it faced off against Choi Han&rsquo;s aura.</p><p>The mage started to speak at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;It's been a long time since I&rsquo;ve seen a human with a darkness attribute, but I didn&rsquo;t know that your plate was so big. The report from Syrem, that child, was wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Syrem. That was the name of the fake Dragon Slayer. The young mage sounded as if he was disappointed in Syrem.</p><p>&rsquo;Dragon half-blood.&rsquo;</p><p>Raon's words echoed in Choi Han&rsquo;s ears. He also felt something weird at that moment.</p><p>&rsquo;This person is strong, but not that strong. So why... Why is my aura unable to move forward?&rsquo;</p><p>It was the moment that Choi Han's confusion showed on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Imperfect darkness cannot defeat perfect light.&rdquo;</p><p>Arm&rsquo;s mage spoke as if he was having fun. Choi Han could see the mage's white gold colored hair. He could also see the same white gold pupils.<br>It was a color that reminded him of the color of thunderbolts.</p><p>&rsquo;Perhaps?&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han recalled how Dragons all had different colors.<br>Every living Dragon had their unique color. That color was said to represent the Dragon's innate attributes. However, a red Dragon didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that it was a Fire Dragon, and a blue Dragon didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that it was a Water Dragon.</p><p>The only certain thing was that Dragons that live much longer than humans could even use that innate color to present themselves.</p><p>But something was weird.</p><p>&rsquo;Isn&rsquo;t Eruhaben-nim the white gold color?&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han could see the mage who was looking at him as if he was looking at a cute toy.</p><p>&ldquo;Your darkness is not perfect yet. Do you know that? My light is perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>Snap.<br>The man snapped his fingers again.<br>Paaaat.<br>Light started to come out of the mana orb that was fighting against Choi Han&rsquo;s sword.</p><p>"That is why you cannot win against me.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han could see his black aura starting to break down.<br>Imperfect darkness was bound to be destroyed by perfect light.</p><p>The mage saw the bright light starting to overtake Choi Han and started to smile. He then looked around. He did not care whether humans died while fighting.<br>It didn&rsquo;t matter to him even if those humans were on his side.</p><p>&rsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as it is fun.&rsquo;</p><p>Yes, fun.<br>He was willing to do anything as long as it was fun. That was why he had killed ally soldiers with the dead mana bombs and just sat back and watched even when Cale's shield and the Dark Elves appeared.</p><p>However, things changed the moment that the two wyverns flew over to the ocean. He could not just sit back and watch when they got so close to him.<br>He was sensitive to just one thing.</p><p>&rsquo;There is the smell of a higher-ranking being.&rsquo;</p><p>It was a scent that he absolutely despised but desired at the same time.<br>However, he could not be certain.<br>That was because the scent was so faint.<br>It was as if it was the scent of a child.</p><p>&rsquo;But it wouldn&rsquo;t be that way if a true lord was alive.&rsquo;</p><p>The existence that was considered to become a Dragon Lord in the future had already died.</p><p>Dragon Lord.<br>This was not something that was passed down through the family. It was determined by nature and by the world.</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>He heard the sound of light exploding once again.<br>The mage raised his back up and looked toward the mana orb that was trying to cover up Choi Han.</p><p>&rsquo;How sad.&rsquo;</p><p>He was about to see a highly skilled swordsman getting injured.<br>He would have tried to draw this man to his side if he had achieved perfect darkness.</p><p>&ldquo;Ho.&rdquo;</p><p>However, the mage soon started to smile. He immediately twisted his body.</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>The black aura cut through the deck of the ship.<br>The mage looked back at the swordsman who destroyed the deck and was chasing after him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still alive!&rdquo;</p><p>The mage could not hide his shock.<br>Although the mana orb did not look like much, it had a bit of light essence in it.</p><p>&rsquo;How did he get away from it?&rsquo;</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>The light mana orb ran into the black aura again. The mage looked at Choi Han, who was bleeding as if he had been burnt by light, and could not hide his shock.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you dodge?&rdquo;</p><p>However, Choi Han ignored him.<br>The light from the orb started to destroy Choi Han&rsquo;s aura little by little.</p><p>Bang!<br>The mana orb exploded once again and Choi Han dodged this by moving forward.</p><p>Crackle, crackle.<br>His cheeks sizzled as the light landed on him.</p><p>However, tens of light orbs appeared in front of Choi Han who just managed to get out of the explosion from the previous mana orb.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you dodge these too?&rdquo;</p><p>The Dragon half-blood mage seemed to be happy.</p><p>&ldquo;Your sword will continue to experience the black aura being destroyed. In the end, your only choice would be to give in to the despair. You&rsquo;re doing something useless!&rdquo;</p><p>Forget the opposite nature of their powers, Choi Han was objectively weaker than him as well. The mage found it interesting that Choi Han continued to come at him even though he should know this difference of power as well.<br>However, there was something he did not know.<br>Choi Han grabbed onto his scabbard.</p><p>Crackle, crackle.<br>The light that trickled down the scabbard scratched at Choi Han&rsquo;s palm.</p><p>Choi Han did not care if his black aura, his darkness, was destroyed.</p><p>The Forest of Darkness.<br>Choi Han had broken down, fallen over, and almost died numerous times in order to survive there.</p><p>In the end, he managed to survive.</p><p>It didn't matter as long as he didn&rsquo;t die.</p><p>&ldquo;Try this one as well!&rdquo;</p><p>Tens of light orbs shot toward Choi Han. Choi Han stared at them as he continued to walk forward.<br>It was at that moment.</p><p>Splaaaaaaaaaaash.</p><p>Choi Han could feel something shooting out of the water.<br>The enemy might not know it, but Choi Han knew.</p><p>&rsquo;It is Raon.&rsquo;</p><p>The power of an angry Dragon was shooting out of the water.<br>The whirlpool was no longer staying underneath the water. Raon's whirlpools that had not been destroyed by the thunderbolts shot up into the air.</p><p>They then started to fuse together. The wind was starting to form into a shape. Choi Han could easily tell what shape the wind was forming into.</p><p>&rsquo;A Dragon.&rsquo;</p><p>The combination of wind and water looked like a large Dragon.<br>The shape was similar to the Black Bone Dragon that had protected the Henituse territory.</p><p>Choi Han understood Raon's intentions.<br>At the same time, he felt someone blocking his way.<br>The Black Bone Wyvern.</p><p>It was defending against tens of light orbs. The wyvern opened up its wings.</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>The wyvern's black wings surrounded the light orbs as if it was hugging them.</p><p>Darkness was not the only thing that was the opposite of light.<br>Death.<br>Death was also the opposite of light.</p><p>Choi Han understood Mary's intentions clearly.<br>He turned around and then immediately started to run while showing his back to the mage.</p><p>Choi Han used the ship's ledge as a stepping stone in order to shoot up into the air and step onto the being that was lowering its head to him.</p><p>The Dragon made of wind and water. Choi Han was now standing on top of that Dragon. There was mana that was serving as his footholds.</p><ul><li>Choi Han, our human told me.</li></ul><p>He could hear Raon's voice in his head.</p><ul><li>He told me to help you.</li></ul><p>Choi Han called forth his remaining aura. The imperfect darkness shot out from the tip of his sword like fire.</p><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s darkness was rough and violent.</p><p>It started when he had been crawling at the bottom of the food chain in the Forest of Darkness.<br>Choi Han was that darkness.</p><ul><li>He also had a message for you. He said to catch him!</li></ul><p>Drip, drip.<br>Some of the black threads around the Bone Wyvern started to fall to the ground. It was barely managing to retain its shape.</p><ul><li>And don't worry. We are great and mighty, even if your darkness is not complete yet.</li></ul><p>Choi Han finally opened his eyes.<br>His innocent smile was missing.</p><p>In its place were all sorts of darknesses.<br>Choi Han&rsquo;s darkness was despair.<br>Since it was his own, it got stronger every time he faced a type of despair.</p><p>The situation at Harris Village, his true nature he had been hiding from Cale, and his true self that felt more happiness and hope than despair revealed his true nature.</p><p>The Birth of a Hero.<br>The Choi Han that should have reached this point far earlier in the original novel finally started to become that character.</p><p>&ldquo;Ahhhhhhhhh!&rdquo;</p><p>The wind and water Dragon let out a roar.</p><p>At the same time, magic spells started to pile up from the the far away shores.<br>It was magic from their allied mages.<br>Those magic spells could not compare to strength of the small thunderbolts, however, they were enough to stab into the enemy ships.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we are strong.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han responded to Raon's statement. The Dragon started to move on top of the water. The first target was this mage who was laughing while standing on the deck of the ship.</p><p>&ldquo;This is really weird. What is this odd scent of a Lord?&rdquo;</p><p>The mage still remained calm.<br>The Dragon Knight known as Choi Han shot his sword toward that mage once again.</p><p>Cale, who had been watching this for a while, started to speak.<br>&ldquo;...I thought I just told you to make the whirlpools visible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You're right! It is a tornado! As for the other part... I turned it into the shape of a Dragon because Dragons are great and mighty!&rdquo;</p><p>Since Raon could not reveal himself, he chose to help out in a way that was shaped like him.<br>Cale felt the corners of his lips starting to twitch.</p><p>&rsquo;How am I going to explain that later?&rsquo;</p><p>That was causing him serious concern.<br>At that moment, Cale noticed an apple pie appearing in thin air as he heard Raon's voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Human, can I use that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Haaaa.&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Why do I always understand whatever he says?&rsquo;</p><p>He could understand it even if parts were missing.</p><p>Cale confidently started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;You said that that bastard&rsquo;s light is perfect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You're right! However, you have something similar! Yours is purer! Was the mage the only one with a thunderbolt? Human, yours and mine are greater than his thunderbolts! Of course, you don&rsquo;t need to do anything since it is difficult, human. I will do it instead!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale had a pure light power as well.<br>Well, it was a purely obsessed with money fiery thunderbolt.<br>It loved money so much that it was scary.</p><p>&rsquo;I can&rsquo;t let Choi Han or Mary overdo it. Raon can't reveal himself either.&rsquo;</p><p>Their mages&rsquo; attacks were limited due to the distance.<br>The Dark Elves also could not do much out in the water.<br>All of the large ships at shore had come out into the deeper waters at this point. The Dark Elves could only hold the Bears behind in order to buy time.</p><p>Cale heard a voice in his head for the first time in a long time.</p><ul><li>Are you going to sacrifice yourself?</li><li>Can I eat this too?</li></ul><p>The Super Rock and glutton each spoke in his mind.<br>Cale looked down at his palm.<br>The fiery thunderbolt seemed as if it wanted to eat the smaller thunderbolts that were currently above the water.</p> <a href="./chapter219.html" class="chapter-nav">
