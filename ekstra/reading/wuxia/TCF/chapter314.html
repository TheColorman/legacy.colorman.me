<p>Silence fell.</p>
<p>It was because Cale looked so vicious when he stated that it would be a shame if Adin died before he could kill him.</p>
<p>However, that silence was soon broken.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ha, hahaha-</li>
</ul>
<p>Laughter poured out from the video communication device.</p>
<p>The bemused laughter fit very well with the refreshing coolness of the spring night.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hahaha!</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the one who was laughing was Imperial Prince Adin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Huu, Cale Henituse. You really...</li>
</ul>
<p>Imperial Prince Adin looked as if he was struggling to suppress his laughter as he took a few deep breaths and gently called Cale&rsquo;s name.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re really an amusing person.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a friendly voice.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t seem to mind Cale&rsquo;s impolite speech and threat.</p>
<p>Several people frowned at Adin&rsquo;s voice. He was speaking with a tone that would make someone think that he was treating Cale as his close younger brother.</p>
<p>In addition, he was relaxed.</p>
<p>The people who realized that fact weren&rsquo;t able to stop frowning.</p>
<p>Rosalyn and Choi Han in particular did not have pleasant expressions. It was because the Imperial Prince had hit them from behind several times.</p>
<p>&rsquo;No, it&rsquo;s a needless thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn shook her head.</p>
<p>What can the Imperial Prince, who is in the Empire and not here, possibly do?</p>
<p>She needlessly got anxious, but she shook off her useless worry.</p>
<p>Adin&rsquo;s voice was heard at that moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cale Henituse, what is it that you want?</li>
</ul>
<p>Flinch.</p>
<p>Rosalyn, Litana, and Choi Han flinched. In particular, Litana, the Queen of the Jungle, immediately knew what Adin was trying to do.</p>
<p>Appeasement.</p>
<p>The Imperial Prince was trying to appease the leader of the enemy now that the Empire&rsquo;s army and his soldiers were being held captive.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to know what you want. I thought about it carefully you know. What does Cale Henituse want? Money? Authority? Fame? Power?</li>
</ul>
<p>Adin spoke in a pleasant voice that was characteristic of him.</p>
<ul>
<li>No, you don&rsquo;t want those things. However, you definitely want something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Litana could see Cale staring silently at the video communication device. Meanwhile, Adin continued to speak.</p>
<ul>
<li>You earnestly want, &rsquo;something,&rsquo; like I do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Haha.</p>
<p>Adin briefly let out a burst of low laughter and soon spoke with pleasure or perhaps excitement.</p>
<ul>
<li>I know the truth. The world may call you a, &rsquo;hero,&rsquo; but you don&rsquo;t look like a, &rsquo;hero,&rsquo; to me. You&rsquo;re not even a good person.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;What kind of nonsense is he spouting!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Litana subconsciously stepped forward at Adin&rsquo;s words. Cale&rsquo;s mouth opened at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. What you say is correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Litana&rsquo;s gaze shifted from the video communication device to Cale. She saw Cale staring at the video communication device with a peculiar smile.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right? I knew that my judgment was correct. I&rsquo;ve been seriously thinking about you this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Swish.</p>
<p>The black cloth that was displayed in the video communication device was slowly drawn back.</p>
<p>Then Adin&rsquo;s face, which seemed to have a pretty good complexion, came into view. Nothing else was visible except Adin&rsquo;s face and the black wall behind him.</p>
<p>Adin&rsquo;s yellow-tinted brown eyes met Cale&rsquo;s dark brown eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cale Henituse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adin and Cale.</p>
<p>The corners of both these people&rsquo;s mouths went up.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re someone similar to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;Similar to Adin?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Litana ended up taking another step or two.</p>
<p>Young master Cale was nothing like Adin. The Cale that she knew from the first time she met him in the fog-filled forest had put out the fire in Section 1 and has always been a righteous person.</p>
<p>He was someone quite different from Adin even though it couldn&rsquo;t be claimed with certainty that he was a good person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We are similar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Litana stopped.</p>
<p>Cale acknowledged Adin&rsquo;s words once again.</p>
<p>He agreed that they were similar.</p>
<p>He himself stated that he was similar to Adin.</p>
<p>Litana looked around.</p>
<p>There were those like the Dark Elf Tasha who were just as confused as she was. Even the enemies looked taken aback. They seemed to be at a loss on what to do while witnessing the friendly atmosphere between the two leaders.</p>
<p>However, Litana gripped the spear in her hand tighter the moment she saw the expressions of Cale&rsquo;s group.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hahahaha!</li>
</ul>
<p>Adin burst into laughter at that moment and proceeded to ask Cale a question.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, what is it that you want? Can you tell me?</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s something that I can&rsquo;t share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale nodded. He then looked at the Imperial Prince who was laughing in delight as if he was happy to meet someone like him and bluntly answered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be a slacker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the sincere truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>What?</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;I said I want to be a slacker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;I want to wipe out all the people like you and comfortably enjoy the peaceful world as a slacker.<br>
I want to live comfortably as a slacker without harming anyone else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale was being serious. It was a dream that he could confidently say in front of anyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>...Are you mocking my words?</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;As if.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an earnest answer that was far from mockery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t you know how hard it is to achieve my dream of becoming a slacker, huh? Are you dismissing my dream right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Litana was at a loss for words seeing Cale acting like a classless delinquent for the first time without his usual charisma and elegance of a noble.</p>
<p>She could also see the mage Rosalyn who was shaking her head back and forth.</p>
<p>In addition, she could see Choi Han and Eruhaben silently nodding their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, being a slacker is an even better job than being an Imperial Prince! It&rsquo;s been a long time since I met a person so similar to me so I told you about my dream, but you&rsquo;re dismissing it? Hm?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>...Ha!</li>
</ul>
<p>Adin let out a sigh-like gasp.</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like you don&rsquo;t plan to converse with me at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, seriously. I&rsquo;m being honest with you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adin&rsquo;s eyes grew colder and colder as Cale pounded his chest in frustration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you saying that the person who controls everything from behind doesn&rsquo;t want anything?</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;No, I said I want to be a slacker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Why can&rsquo;t he fucking understand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale was genuinely frustrated, but everyone aside from his group simply viewed it as Cale completely mocking the Imperial Prince.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, yes. I get it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The smile on Adin&rsquo;s lips did not disappear even then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, thanks for understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale nodded and bluntly added on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then sit tight and wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His laughter disappeared. He took in Adin&rsquo;s image from the video communication device and continued on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adin was still smiling the same as ever.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure. War is a battle against time, so you should hurry. Let me know if you decide on what you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adin spoke lightheartedly as expected.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll give you a present for now.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;A present?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s eyebrows rose slightly.</p>
<p>Imperial Prince Adin&rsquo;s palm appeared on the video communication device&rsquo;s screen at that moment. There was a small orb in his hand that let out a cracking sound as it began to break.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Oooong-</p>
<p>Cale turned his head to one side.</p>
<p>He looked toward the source of the tremor. One of the Dark Elves nearby shouted with wide eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magic stones, the magic stones in the cockpit are acting strangely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dark Elves that had entered the airship&rsquo;s cockpit and were binding the alchemist pilots were anxiously looking at the cockpit.</p>
<p>Ooong-</p>
<p>The airship&rsquo;s power supply.</p>
<p>The magic stones began to vibrate crazily and radiate heat. Cale started to frown as he heard Adin&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, I feel good when everything is in the palm of my hand. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Adin was laughing.</p>
<ul>
<li>My order was to, &rsquo;destroy,&rsquo; the Jungle.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;Could it be?&rsquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m also always prepared for any kind of situation. I always keep in mind the possibility of my proud army failing to carry out my orders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Screeech, screech.</p>
<p>Ooong, oong.</p>
<p>The magic stones continued to spew out more heat and the hull of the airship trembled.</p>
<p>Crack. Craaack.</p>
<p>Cale heard the tree trunks that he had tied up breaking. This was because the tree branches that had entangled with the airship&rsquo;s power supply units were shaken off due to the excessive movements.</p>
<p>The whole ship began to slowly heat up as if the ship didn&rsquo;t care if it broke.</p>
<p>The source that caused the heat and vibrations were the many magic stones in the cockpit.</p>
<p>Each of the magic stones served as the central control and steering mechanism as well as the switch to activate all of the different devices on the airship.</p>
<p>Cale made eye contact with Adin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Guess whether the airship has a self-destruction device or not?</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn and Choi Han started to frown.</p>
<p>They were reminded of the Whipper Kingdom war.</p>
<p>Adin was someone who didn&rsquo;t care if his own army died or not.</p>
<p>He was someone who didn&rsquo;t care about the means as long as he got the desired results.</p>
<p>It was Adin who brought Honte as a suicide bomber during the war against the Whipper Kingdom. He even pretended to dearly value Honte.</p>
<p>What did he value the most this time?</p>
<p>&rsquo;The airship!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn urgently shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to stop the magic stones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ooong-</p>
<p>Red mana rose around her at that moment. She immediately approached the cockpit and started to frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Damn it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magic stones were violently rotating, vibrating, and expelling heat in a way that was impossible to stop after the invocation of the self-destruction device.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...It looks like they&rsquo;ll explode if we handle them the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn was not confident that she could easily maintain the balance of the volatile magic stones with her current magic skills.</p>
<p>The current situation of the cockpit was one where the magic bomb that were counting down would immediately explode if one accidentally mishandled the magic stones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hahahaha!</li>
</ul>
<p>Loud laughter rang out from Imperial Prince Adin. Cale turned his head to his side at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y, your highness-&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face of the alchemist in charge was white with fright as he trembled. His body that he couldn&rsquo;t move was full of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y, your highness, I need to liv-&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Hahahahaha!</li>
</ul>
<p>The alchemist&rsquo;s plea to be saved was buried under Adin&rsquo;s laughter.</p>
<p>However, the Imperial Prince&rsquo;s voice was buried under Litana&rsquo;s voice as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone get down from the airship! Evacuate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow her majesty&rsquo;s orders! All Dark Elves immediately call your Elementals and move the people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tasha followed up quickly with an order.</p>
<p>Cale slowly shifted his gaze with a frown on his face.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a great gift, isn&rsquo;t it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Adin saw Cale start to frown even more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...You&rsquo;re trash.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s always fun to see an angry face like that. After all, you&rsquo;re the one who suffers and gets hurt every time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s current actions were similar to when he rushed to block the Tower Master&rsquo;s disciple Honte&rsquo;s explosion.</p>
<p>Adin believed Cale was always on the losing end.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;...Son of a bitch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adin could see Cale trembling as if he couldn&rsquo;t contain his anger to the point that the video communication device&rsquo;s screen was shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master Cale! What should we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commander, let us escape for now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imperial Prince Adin could hear Rosalyn and Litana urgently calling out to Cale. He started to speak cheekily while putting on an even more pleasant expression.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can try saving the others like you did last time. Ah, is it a bit difficult to open up a shield for this? Good luck.</li>
</ul>
<p>He then burst out in loud laughter at Cale&rsquo;s subsequent actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hahahaha-!</li>
</ul>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The video communication device was thrown to the floor and started to crack.</p>
<p>However, the sound was buried under the airship&rsquo;s tremors and the sound coming from the magic stones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hahahaha!</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the sound of Adin&rsquo;s laughter continued.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t contain his laughter at Cale throwing the video communication device down in anger with a frown on his face.</p>
<p>Crack! Craaack!</p>
<p>Cale stomped on the video communication device. The video communication device lost the visual connection, but Adin&rsquo;s laughter didn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>He continued to speak rather happily.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your angry face is quite amusing, very amusing! Hahahaha!</li>
</ul>
<p>Craaack!</p>
<p>The video communication device broke in half and the connection completely broke off after Cale violently stomped on it one last time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hahaha- ha.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Imperial Prince&rsquo;s laughter also stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>All connection with Adin was over. There were no longer any other video communication devices that could reach Adin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Young master Cale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn flinched as she looked at Cale then approached him with a solemn expression and put a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Oooong-</p>
<p>The airship heated up more and more and began to turn into a bomb on the brink of explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master Cale! I know that you are angry, but we must evacuate everyone right now! I&rsquo;ll also open up a shield so-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn stopped her urgent words at Cale&rsquo;s voice which could be heard even as his head was bowed as he stared at the broken fragments of the video communication device.</p>
<p>Rosalyn&rsquo;s urgent expression changed in a peculiar way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master Cale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could see Cale slowly lifting up his head.</p>
<p>He was laughing quite refreshingly.</p>
<p>He was laughing as if he had never been angry and as if his rage just now was all an act.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...An act?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn could hear Cale&rsquo;s blunt statement the moment she slowly lowered the hand that she put on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bastard who doesn&rsquo;t understand the value of things. That&rsquo;s why guys like Adin are wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn was bewildered by Cale&rsquo;s sudden remark, but her eyes widened as Cale&rsquo;s gaze turned to one place.</p>
<p>Cale was looking in a direction as he started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we were able to make use of this airship? It would be a waste to throw it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s gaze went beyond the shaking alchemist who couldn&rsquo;t move an inch.</p>
<p>Cale was looking beyond the alchemist towards another being even during the time when the alchemist was earnestly calling Imperial Prince Adin&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>He asked the being who was still chuckling like he had been doing since then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right, Eruhaben-nim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ancient Dragon, Eruhaben.</p>
<p>He started to smile at Cale&rsquo;s following words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eruhaben-nim, I&rsquo;m sure that the Imperial Prince thinks that this airship is destroyed by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale could see Eruhaben slowly raising his hand. He recalled the conversation he had with Eruhaben before this operation began.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Cale Henituse, I&rsquo;ll take care of the center where the airship is. Of course, you humans will take all the credit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Ah! Eruhaben-nim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;What is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;I&rsquo;d like to reuse it if it&rsquo;s possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;What a greedy bastard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was obvious even if he didn&rsquo;t bother saying what he wanted to reuse.</p>
<p>The airship. That was it.</p>
<p>The ancient Dragon leisurely added on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all that&rsquo;s left is for you to have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so what should we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale, who was excited to obtain the airship, was ready to put up his shield. He seemed ready to do anything.</p>
<p>Rosalyn admired Cale who coveted the airship as she approached to help Eruhaben after understanding the whole situation.</p>
<p>It was at that moment. Cale saw the relaxed ancient Dragon respond with arrogance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I got this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ancient Dragon snapped at that moment.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>White-gold mana surged from Eruhaben at the sound of the light snap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale subconsciously covered his eyes with his hands.</p>
<p>It was bright.</p>
<p>An extremely bright white-gold light burst out from Eruhaben.</p>
<p>Everyone would think that this light was an explosion if a sound that could pierce the eardrum accompanied it.</p>
<p>Flinch. </p>
<p>A very small sound was heard when Cale took a step back despite himself.</p>
<p>Psssshhhh-</p>
<p>It was breaking.</p>
<p>The sound of something hard turning to dust could be heard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human... As expected, Goldie gramps is great!</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was sincere admiration in Raon&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Cale slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>He looked around him.</p>
<p>Everyone who had taken a step or two back like him or sank to the group and had their eyes closed slowly opened their eyes one by one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wow! Human! Look at the sky! Wow!</li>
</ul>
<p>Raon&rsquo;s exclamation could be heard.</p>
<p>What Cale saw immediately after opening his eyes was a cockpit soaring high into the sky.</p>
<p>The airship and the cockpit that contained the magic stones and several other devices.</p>
<p>The metal-lined cockpit turned to dust while the magic stones that were within it began to climb up very high into the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those magic stones will explode if you recklessly tamper with them and break the balance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn&rsquo;s astonished voice was heard.</p>
<p>However, Eruhaben maintained the balance within the magic stones and sent them far up high into the sky, contrary to her concerns.</p>
<p>Then soon after.</p>
<p>Kaboooom! Booom!</p>
<p>A deafening explosion resounded in the sky.</p>
<p>The shining white gold dust embroidered the sky and slowly fell down.</p>
<p>Cale could hear Rosalyn&rsquo;s genuinely bewildered voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T, that was no simple task. T, they were volatile magic stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t respond to Rosalyn.</p>
<p>Cale looked at Eruhaben instead. In front of him was the alchemist who had fainted while standing up.</p>
<p>The ancient Dragon was looking sourly at the alchemist, but grinned as he made eye contact with Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;That was easy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was because I tried it before long ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;...How long ago was this? Five hundred years ago? A thousand years ago?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale heard the voices of two Dragons in his mind at that moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human! You really are a weak human! Goldie gramps is super strong! But I think he overdid it! But, as expected, he&rsquo;s a Dragon! He&rsquo;s still fine! He is the greatest being after me!</li>
</ul>
<p>The other Dragon&rsquo;s words were very simple and heavy, unlike the fuss that the excited six-year-old was making.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m a Dragon.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;...As expected from a Dragon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale couldn&rsquo;t suppress the corners of his mouth that were twitching upwards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weak human! Can I steer this airship? Let&rsquo;s go destroy the Imperial Prince!</li>
</ul>
<p>The corners of Cale&rsquo;s mouth ended up going up as another voice was heard in his mind at that moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m full.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was the glutton.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll leave the purification of the dead mana to you. You have to hurry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cale turned his head.</p>
<p>Black tree trunks filled the entirety of Section 7.</p>
<p>Then there was also Mary whose black robe dragged behind her as she climbed onto the airship.</p>
<p>He burst into laughter after seeing those two sights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Human, are you excited about destroying the Empire? I&rsquo;m excited too!</li>
</ul>
<p>Cale bent over and laughed refreshingly at the center of Section 7 in the middle of the night.</p> <a href="./chapter313.html" class="chapter-nav">
