<p>But once the sun came up all the way...</p>
<p>Cale calmly said something to everyone there who were clenching their weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get some rest first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Get some rest? In this situation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked around.</p>
<p>The Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters were quickly retreating, but the living Grade 1 monsters were still here.</p>
<p>But everybody there suddenly saw something weird.</p>
<p>Last night...</p>
<p>It was something they were unable to see during that hell-like chaos.</p>
<p>That something was located where Choi Han and Cale had mainly been fighting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Those monsters are-&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were cold corpses of quite large monsters underneath the corpses of the Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters that had charged in here.</p>
<p>They seemed larger than the other Grade 1 monsters.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho blurted out the thought that came to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second taster monsters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similar to how there were taster monsters between the Grade 3 and Grade 2 monsters, there were supposed to be taster monsters between the Grade 2 and Grade 1 monster switch too.</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Those were the second taster monsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked toward the Grade 1 monsters that were just glaring at them after seeing that the humans were not attacking as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just huge. The second taster monsters are much easier to deal with than the first taster monsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although they were larger than normal Grade 1 monsters, their strength was only between Grade 1 and Grade 2 monsters.</p>
<p>They were at about Grade 1.5.</p>
<p>There were no leader monsters either.</p>
<p>This information had been recorded in the future.</p>
<p>&lt; As for the second round of taster monsters, the Grade 1 monsters did not attack the central shelter for a set amount of time even after all of the taster monsters were defeated. This was different than the situation with the first round of taster monsters. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt; The first round of taster monsters were special while the patterns for the second round of taster monsters were easier to understand. &gt;</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, it was the first round of taster monsters that were weird.</p>
<p>It was the transition between Grade 3 and Grade 2 monsters but Grade 1 monsters came out as tasters and their leader was much stronger than regular Grade 1 monsters.</p>
<p>That was why these Grade 1.5 monsters in the second round of tasters... Truly fit the term, &rsquo;taster.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are safe until 9 am as the Grade 1 monsters will not attack the shelter. Everybody can go back and get some rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han walked over to the calmly speaking Cale.</p>
<p>Shake.</p>
<p>Choi Han slightly shook his sword and monster blood fell off the sword and onto the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others all watched this with different expressions.</p>
<p>However, they were all full of shock and astonishment.</p>
<p>&rsquo;They were able to locate the taster monsters and kill them all during that chaos? Those two really went hunting.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;...They didn't only kill the taster monsters. They were the ones to kill the most Grade 1 monsters as well.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Holy crap! They created a mountain of monster corpses!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho, Kim Min Ah, and Park Jin Tae. They each had different thoughts but came to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Amazing.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;I really need to follow this person to Seomyeon.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;...Crazy bastard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Bae Cheol-Ho mumbled...</p>
<p>"We survived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conclusion that all their different emotions reached was that they had survived.</p>
<p>"Everybody, please come over here for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale walked away from the spot where the Grade 1 monsters had gathered and motioned to the others.</p>
<p>Originally, the Grade 1 monsters would be split up into three groups to attack the three central shelters later, but...</p>
<p>Cale had used the fire and the Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters to gather the Grade 1 monsters to one spot.</p>
<p>"Do you have something to tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked around at the people who had gathered here and asked Cale the question.</p>
<p>Cale looked at the group and started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between 9 am and 12 pm... Every shelter in the world will disappear for three hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The central shelters lost their powers at noon yesterday, however...</p>
<p>Other temporary shelters were slowly losing their powers one by one.</p>
<p>And all shelters would disappear from Earth for the last three hours of this 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>Cale lifted up one finger.</p>
<p>"We will fight for one of those three hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then lifted up another finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will only focus on defending for the remaining two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked at his allies who were covered in monster fluids and blood, as well as small injuries, as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jang Man Soo, Jae Ha-Jung, and Kim Rok Soo. These three people will each cast shields on the three central shelters. Bae Puh Rum will move around with Joo Ho-Shik so that Joo Ho-Shik can use his ability on each central shelter's defender to support them.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho raised his hand into the air.</p>
<p>His pupils were shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. K ... You also have a defensive ability-&rdquo;<br>
"I do.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho let out a gasp.</p>
<p>Cale didn&rsquo;t care as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have much time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, other ability users will need to fight the Grade 1 monsters during those two hours of defense. But once it becomes noon...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be another solar eclipse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could tell that the solar eclipse was the signal to show that this day of battle was over even without him saying anything.</p>
<p>Cale saw that they understood and pointed toward the central shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why we should head back for now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han walked toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to get on my back?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale shook his head and motioned to the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grrrrrr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger came over.</p>
<p>It was not the only one. The Steel Feather Hawk and the White Rabbit came over as well, and Cale started to speak to the two monsters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s discuss the deal in detail after we move to the new central shelter.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hmph, fine. Just know that you'll be in serious trouble if you try anything funny.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;That is totally fine. There is definitely a need for a discussion of value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk and White Rabbit each said something before stepping back. Cale then got on the back of the Dark Tiger that had lowered its head.</p>
<p>Cale called Choi Han over with a serious expression as the others quietly watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choi Han.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, hyung-nim. I will wake you up at 9 am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Hmm?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the others became confused...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I'm going to get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale laid down on the Dark Tiger's soft fur and... He then instantly fell asleep.</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at him with a satisfied gaze before turning his head. The others were looking at him with all sorts of emotions.</p>
<p>Even the two leader monsters were looking at Choi Han and Cale with confused expressions.</p>
<p>Choi Han debated what to say after seeing their expressions before he started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m relieved that Rok Soo hyung did not end up fainting. I will see you all at 9 am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han smiled innocently and followed behind the Dark Tiger that was slowly returning to the central shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...My goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae who was watching this shook his head as he followed behind Choi Han.</p>
<p>It was the same for the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only Joo Ho-Shik was looking at Choi Han and Cale with an odd gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...The two of their abilities seemed a bit special.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik looked down at his hands.</p>
<p>He had clasped them together all night to pray.</p>
<p>He didn't believe in any religion, but it was the action he thought of whenever he thought of a prayer, so it had became a habit now.</p>
<p>He had many thoughts in the past regarding this ability that had suddenly appeared after the cataclysm.</p>
<p>Is there a god?</p>
<p>What am I supposed to have faith in?</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik who had nothing to believe in other than himself had started to think about god even though he didn't believe in any religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Hmm. They said that both of them had suddenly appeared, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo was supposedly an orphan.</p>
<p>Choi Han had suddenly appeared claiming to be Kim Rok Soo's close dongsaeng.</p>
<p>Both of them also used powers that were different from the others.</p>
<p>He could tell the difference clearly because he had used his 'faith&rsquo; ability to support them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Are they human?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Were those two people really human? Or, were they something else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>An odd glow filled Joo Ho-Shik's eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Mr. Joo Ho-Shik!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard a grumbling voice at that moment.</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Why are you standing there with a blank expression?! Are you not coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae had turned back and was grumbling at Joo Ho-Shik in an annoyed voice. Joo Ho-Shik smiled gently and started to walk toward his central shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...He&rsquo;s a weird one alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae watched Joo Ho-Shik with a suspicious gaze before starting to walk again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grrrrrr.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Screeeeeech---&rdquo;</p>
<p>The still remaining large number of Grade 1 monsters were biding their time and glaring at the humans.</p>
<hr>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Loud banging noises were coming from all directions.</p>
<p>The Grade 1 monsters were attacking more intensely than ever before.</p>
<p>Buzz. Buzz.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Kim Min Joon! This is Bae Cheol-Ho! Please send Mr. Joo Ho-Shik over here!</li>
</ul>
<p>Kim Min Joon quickly responded into the walkie-talkie after hearing Bae Cheol-Ho&rsquo;s request from the second central shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Joo Ho-Shik will be there soon!&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Please have him come as soon as possible! Jae Ha-Jung is barely holding on!</li>
</ul>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho's voice was hard to hear because of the loud noises.</p>
<p>It was probably the same situation on Bae Cheol-Ho's side as well.</p>
<p>"Grandma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon grabbed the walkie-talkie.</p>
<ul>
<li>Min Joon! I sent Mr. Joo Ho-Shi with Puh Rum!<br>
&ldquo;Thank you very much!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</li>
</ul>
<p>Kim Min Joon could hear the banging noises on the other side of the walkie-talkie. He subconsciously started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Jang Man Soo doing okay?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, Man Soo is doing well! Min Ah is safe too!</li>
</ul>
<p>Jang Man Soo was responsible for the third central shelter&rsquo;s defense.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you okay over there?</li>
</ul>
<p>Kim Min Joon looked forward after hearing Grandma Kim's question.</p>
<p>Through the building&rsquo;s open door...</p>
<ul>
<li>You guys received the least of Mr. Joo Ho-Shik's ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung had received the most of Joo Ho-Shik&rsquo;s &rsquo;Faith&rsquo; ability since their defensive plan had started. Next was Jang Man Soo.</p>
<p>The defender of this central shelter where Kim Min Joon was at had received Joo Ho-Shik's help the least.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the other ability users other than Choi Han were sent to the other central shelters as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was the case.</p>
<p>The only one here to fight was Choi Han.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if the Dark Tiger is there... You guys have the least amount of ability users.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, even with that being the case...</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon could say the following to her.</p>
<p>"We are safe here. Please don't worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>Grade 1 monsters were furiously charging forward.</p>
<p>They were heading toward the silver shield.</p>
<p>They were heading toward the two wings that spread out from the shield and covered the entire building.</p>
<p>However, the shield stayed firm.</p>
<p>It did not break.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon could see Kim Rok Soo who was standing there with his hand on the shield.</p>
<p>Whether it was because the shield was extremely large...</p>
<p>Or because Kim Rok Soo was quite small...</p>
<p>But it looked as if the shield and two wings were coming out of Kim Rok Soo's whole body and protecting this place.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon could see Kim Rok Soo's face properly because he was closer to Kim Rok Soo than the others.</p>
<p>He could see Rok Soo's body as well.</p>
<p>Blood had started to flow out of the corners of his mouth again.</p>
<p>And, although he was standing firm, his hands and arms were slightly shaking.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon heard Lee Jin Joo's voice at that moment.</p>
<p>{The current time is 11:55 am.}</p>
<p>It was coming to an end.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon heard Lee Seung Won mumbling next to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The current time is 11:55 am. Defender Kim Rok Soo&rsquo;s shield is still standing firm while Choi Han and the Dark Tiger are continuing their attacks from outside the shield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two black figures outside the half-transparent silver shield were darting through the battlefield.</p>
<p>They were, of course, the Dark Tiger and Choi Han.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t stop all of the Grade 1 monsters, but Choi Han and the Dark Tiger were taking care of most of them.</p>
<p>Cale would not have been able to last so long if they had not been able to do so.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon looked toward Kim Rok Soo, Choi Han, and the Dark Tiger for a moment.</p>
<p>The past 24 hours slowly passed through his mind.</p>
<p>Buzz. Buzz.</p>
<ul>
<li>Min Joon. See you soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kim Min Joon quietly responded to Grandma Kim's voice from the still connected walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. See you soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then heard Lee Jin Joo's voice again.</p>
<p>{The current time is 11:58 am.}</p>
<p>There were only two minutes left now.</p>
<p>The people at all three central shelters slowly looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>They looked toward the sun.</p>
<p>The past 24 hours passed through their minds as if it was a movie.</p>
<p>Although it had felt like hell, they could now reflect on it as they had survived.</p>
<p>This was the same for Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale kept his groan quiet as he held his two arms steady. The silver shield stayed up without shaking at all.</p>
<p>{The current time is 11:59 am.}</p>
<p>The Grade 1 monsters charged forward crazier than ever before.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Hand, feet, head... The monsters aimed for Cale&rsquo;s shield with everything they had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huff. Huff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale could see Choi Han breathing heavily on the other side of the shield.</p>
<p>Choi Han was very strong, but he still had a limit to his stamina as he was human.</p>
<p>Cale and Choi Han were both exhausted.</p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>&rsquo;Just a little longer...&rsquo;</p>
<p>If they held out just a tiny bit longer...</p>
<p>{10.}</p>
<p>Lee Jin Joo's countdown had started.</p>
<p>{9. 8. 7...}</p>
<p>If he held on just a bit longer...</p>
<p>{4. 3...}</p>
<p>Cale lifted his head up.</p>
<p>Really soon now...</p>
<p>{2. 1.}</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>The sun was covered in darkness.</p>
<p>The monsters&rsquo; attacks, their chilling screams...</p>
<p>They all instantly stopped.</p>
<p>Cale, well, Kim Rok Soo finally felt it.</p>
<p>At this very moment...</p>
<p>&rsquo;I...&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I changed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;My past. My record. My regret. My despair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He finally changed one thing.</p>
<p>Cale closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them back.</p>
<p>Once he opened his eyes to a world of darkness because the sun was covered up...</p>
<p>He saw a beautiful light in the distance.</p>
<p>It felt like an aurora that had come down to the ground.</p>
<p>And he saw a large castle surrounded by that aurora.</p>
<p>He could see a multi-story large castle with a Korean-style tile roof.</p>
<p>There were modern-looking buildings surrounding that castle as well.</p>
<p>He then heard Lee Jin Joo&rsquo;s shaking voice.</p>
<p>{The place you see right now...}</p>
<p>Everybody was looking at the place Cale had talked about the whole day.</p>
<p>{The place you see right now is our new base.}</p>
<p>{Once the sun comes out again...}</p>
<p>{We will head over there.}</p>
<p>And once 1 minute passed and the sun reappeared...</p>
<p>The Grade 1 monsters dispersed quickly as if that had been the deal.</p>
<p>Cale deactivated his shield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rok Soo hyung.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You worked hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale patted Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulder and turned around.</p>
<p>He motioned to the people who had been inside the building all day while shaking in fear.</p>
<p>He was motioning for them to come outside.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to our new home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was telling them they should quickly move to the new central shelter, their new base.</p>
<hr>
<p>The core ability users of the three central shelters who had been the only ones to have &rsquo;zero deaths&rsquo; in this 'first central shelter destruction incident&rsquo; gathered in the large castle at the center of the large new central shelter.</p>
<p>In the meeting room at the top of that castle...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kim Rok Soo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>"So, you&rsquo;re saying... No, according to your &rsquo;foresight&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae suppressed his wildly beating heart and barely managed to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An &rsquo;unranked monster&rsquo; will soon appear in Seomyeon, Busan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae, Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum, and the others.</p>
<p>Many of them were looking at Cale&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Choi Han was standing behind Cale as if he was a guard.</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth and gave a short response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why I plan on going to Seomyeon, Busan.&rdquo;</p> <a href="./chapter577.html" class="chapter-nav">
