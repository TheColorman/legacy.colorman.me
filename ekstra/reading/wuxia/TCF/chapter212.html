The southeast region and central region's factions realized that something was wrong.</p><p>Crown prince Alberu started to speak at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;If we look through history, the citizens who survive a war cry thinking about how they managed to survive while the people in power start a new battle to fight for power.&rdquo;</p><p>The crown prince&rsquo;s gaze headed toward the nobles of the southeast region and central region.</p><p>&ldquo;People easily get delusional.&rdquo;</p><p>He was sitting with his chin in his hand as he looked right at the Marquis and Duke.</p><p>&ldquo;They think that they will survive even though the war is not yet over. It's quite funny yet pitiful.&rdquo;</p><p>Marquis Sand Ailan avoided the crown prince&rsquo;s gaze and closed his eyes.<br>Deep wrinkles appeared on his face.</p><p>He had been had.<br>He thought that he had set up a trap to suppress Cale Henituse, but it was the opposite.<br>This was a trap to choke him.</p><p>Marquis Sand Ailan opened his eyes back and looked around the hall.</p><p>Why would the southwest region and the northwest region take the crown's side?</p><p>&rsquo;I guess Taylor Stan makes sense.&rsquo;</p><p>The eldest son of the former Marquis Stan. It was said that his legs were healed thanks to the crown prince. It was a good enough reason to develop a bond with the crown prince.<br>However, the Gyerre household had been against the crown prince.</p><p>Marquis Ailan made eye contact with Duchess Sonata Gyerre.</p><p>Smirk.<br>The old noble smiled toward the Marquis. She then turned her head to look toward Cale Henituse.</p><p>&rsquo;...That old hag!&rsquo;</p><p>Marquis Sand Ailan bit down on his lips.<br>That old woman was supporting Cale Henituse and not the crown.<br>The Marquis let out a deep sigh. He heard the crown prince continuing to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to do something if you want to survive.&rdquo;</p><p>The crown prince called out to Cale for support.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right, commander?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale slowly nodded his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, your highness.&rdquo;</p><p>Although it sounded as if only the two of them were chatting, not many other people could speak right now.</p><p>&ldquo;With that being said, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any reason for me to be here anymore since I am finished with my report.&rdquo;<br>Marquis Sand Ailan flinched before looking toward Cale.</p><p>&rsquo;He's leaving? Already? He&rsquo;s not going to stay to see the results?&rsquo;</p><p>The Marquis could not understand why Cale would leave without hearing about the results of the Caro Kingdom business. He observed Cale's face to see if he could notice anything until Cale's next words clarified it for him.</p><p>&ldquo;The rest is up to the nobles and I do not have any say as I am not a noble.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale was a commander but he was still just a young master who had not received his father&rsquo;s title.<br>However, his gaze was still looking down at them while he said that he did not have the qualifications.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;</p><p>The Marquis let out a groan.<br>That was a warning and a treat.<br>It was a warning that he would be waiting to see what kind of decision the nobles ended up making. The Marquis could feel a headache brewing inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Then, goodbye.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale casually said goodbye.</p><p>&ldquo;I am leaving now in order to survive.&rdquo;</p><p>The nobles were quiet and the crown prince gave him permission to leave.<br>Cale leisurely turned away from the nobles and headed for the entrance.</p><p>&rsquo;The Dominating Aura truly is best to scam or scare people.&rsquo;</p><p>His footsteps were light as he managed to take care of this annoying business earlier than he had expected. Of course, only he knew the lightness of his footsteps.</p><ul><li>I will remember the faces of that Marquis and Duke.</li></ul><p>Cale almost flinched at Raon's mumblings but just let it go as he stood in front of the door.<br>He then happily pushed the door open.</p><p>Screeech- Bang!</p><p>The door opened with a loud noise.</p><p>&rsquo;Eek!&rsquo;</p><p>Cale gasped but made it so nobody would notice.<br>Choi Han and Mary were standing right outside the door.</p><p>He had told them to stay outside the door, but he did not expect they would be right outside of it. Cale had to calm his heart.</p><p>He then started to move quickly.</p><p>Tap. Tap.<br>Cale's hands landed on Mary and Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>It would be bad if Choi Han started to speak and acted terribly or if Mary used her GPS-like voice and said something nice.</p><p>Cale then took his hand off of their shoulders and started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>The two started to follow Cale who walked forward without looking back.<br>That was why he was unable to see all of Choi Han and Mary's movements.<br>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;</p><p>The Marquis subconsciously clenched onto the arm rest.<br>Cale Henituse. The two people in black who were standing outside the door.</p><p>One was a man with black hair and black eyes while the other was wearing a black robe that made it impossible to see any part of their face or body.<br>Those two were probably the sword master and the necromancer.</p><p>Seeing the two of them wearing black as well made the Marquis feel chills down his back.<br>The two of them slowly started to move after the commander&rsquo;s order to, &rsquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rsquo;</p><p>The Marquis could see Cale Henituse leaving without any regrets.<br>Furthermore, he could see the sword master and necromancer who were looking around the hall.</p><p>Choi Han and Mary looked around the hall as they slowly turned around to follow behind Cale.</p><p>Mary&rsquo;s black robe made it so that the nobles could not see her gaze that was full of curiosity and wariness. She took a quick look around before following behind Cale.</p><p>However, Choi Han&rsquo;s gaze was fully visible to the nobles.</p><p>The highest-grade expert, Marquis Sand Ailan. He felt as if he could not breathe after seeing the sword master's gaze on him.<br>Choi Han only looked at those who had opposed Cale.</p><p>"Are you not coming?&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han stopped glaring after hearing Cale&rsquo;s voice. Cale had stopped walking and turned around to see what was going on. He then turned away from the nobles and quickly followed behind Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Nothing, Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale started to walk again as Choi Han approached him.</p><p>The door slowly closed and the view of Cale&rsquo;s back slowly disappeared.</p><p>Screeeech- boom!<br>The commander could no longer be seen once the door completely closed. Crown prince Alberu's voice filled the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us start the voting for this issue.&rdquo;</p><p>The process moved quieter than ever before.</p><p>One hour later, Cale was able to hear the results through the crown prince.</p><p>They had approved it.<br>Other than a few votes, the rest supported the decision to send reinforcements to the Caro Kingdom.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Daddy, do you think I'll get to meet the Commander-nim?&rdquo;</p><p>The father smiled as the child asked while banging on his silver shield.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Isn&rsquo;t that why we got up so early to stand in the front like this?&rdquo;</p><p>The child laughed at his father&rsquo;s words as joy and anticipation was evident on his face. The father was looking at the child with a nostalgic gaze.</p><p>A few months ago.<br>He had cheered for the crown prince and young master Cale on their way to the Mogoru Empire. The father still clearly remembered what young master Cale had said to his son who was cheering for him.</p><p>&rsquo;I want to be a cool person like you, young master-nim!&rsquo;</p><p>The noble who was heralded as a hero had said something unexpected when his son had said that.</p><p>&rsquo;You won&rsquo;t be cool at all if you are like me.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;Take after your father instead. Only your parents are cool enough to hug you and lift you up like this.&rsquo;</p><p>He had never seen a noble who said things like this.<br>Recalling that moment made him still full of pride. He remembered how his son's eyes had sparkled as he looked at him after hearing young master Cale&rsquo;s words.</p><p>And today.<br>He was back to the streets with his son once again.</p><p>He was here to greet Commander Cale Henituse on his way to the Caro Kingdom.</p><p>Bang. Bang.<br>He could hear his son banging on his shield. He heard some of the people around him speaking at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think it is okay for us to send the Commander-nim to the Caro Kingdom when the war is not over yet?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He's even taking the sword master-nim and the necromancer-nim with him. Some of the knights and the First Mage Brigade are going as well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But the navy and the Knights Brigade are not going. The other Mage Brigades are not going either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but.&rdquo;</p><p>The citizen continued to speak as if he was calming his scared friend.</p><p>&ldquo;The Commander-nim personally said to his highness that he would teleport right back if the Roan Kingdom was in danger. He considers our Roan Kingdom to be the most important.&rdquo;</p><p>He started to get emotional and raised his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you not hear about the conversation the Commander-nim had with his highness?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I heard the rumors.&rdquo;</p><p>A rumor spread like wildfire through the capital yesterday.<br>It was supposedly a conversation between Cale and the crown prince. They had no way of knowing if it was true or not, but it sounded like something the two of them would say.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember what the Commander-nim said during that conversation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...The Roan Kingdom is strong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes. Although everybody thinks we are nothing, the Roan Kingdom managed an overwhelming victory and showed our strength is what he said. He said we should trust in ourselves more since we are strong and help out those who are in need. He said we should let the world experience the strength of the Roan Kingdom once again.&rdquo;</p><p>The father who was caressing his son&rsquo;s head nodded at the citizen&rsquo;s statement.</p><p>You could trust the words of the person who protected the Roan Kingdom.</p><p>&ldquo;Furthermore, we have the heroes, the sword master-nim and the necromancer-nim. So let&rsquo;s trust them.&rdquo;</p><p>This was indeed the case.<br>There were two very strong heroes.</p><p>&ldquo;...But to call a necromancer a hero...&rdquo;</p><p>The man who was holding his son started to frown after hearing that comment. He opened his mouth to speak. However, the person talking to that citizen was faster.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with the necromancer-nim? The necromancer-nim is a hundred times, no, a thousand times better than those other northeast region's nobles who did nothing! Did you not see the video? It was a Dragon, a Dragon! How great and mighty did those Dragon bones look? Did you think that was evil?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, but still. You know those stories we've heard about.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who cares about those stories? What matters is that we survive.&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Good, he&rsquo;s saying what I want to say.&rsquo;<br>The man smiled with satisfaction before lifting his son up to his arms.<br>It was at that moment.<br>Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-</p><p>The sound of a trumpet could be heard.</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo;</p><p>He fixed his excited son in his arms and looked toward where his son was looking.</p><p>Clang. Clang.</p><p>Swords were being drawn up toward the sky.<br>All sorts of colorful mana orbs shot up to the air as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;</p><p>The child watched the knights and mages walking toward them while in his father&rsquo;s arms. He then shouted toward his father.</p><p>&ldquo;That mister must be the sword master-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>He could see a man with black hair and black eyes at the center of the knights. The only sword master in the Roan Kingdom.<br>It was a man with a pure yet strong face. He also looked handsome enough to draw people's gazes toward him.</p><p>The child with the shield watched everybody walk by.<br>The Mage Brigade, the knights, and the sword master. He saw them all.</p><p>However, the person the child was searching for could not be seen.</p><p>Cale Henituse.<br>He was not visible.<br>They could only see a carriage behind the sword master.</p><p>&rsquo;Is the Commander-nim inside the carriage?&rsquo;</p><p>The child&rsquo;s eyes sparkled.<br>The carriage window slowly lowered as if it understood the child's thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;</p><p>Necromancer.<br>He could see the necromancer wearing a black robe. The child cheered for this hero he had never seen before.</p><p>&ldquo;···Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>However, his face was full of confusion.</p><p>He could not see him.<br>He felt as if there should be one more person in the carriage and that it would be Commander Cale-nim. However, the Commander-nim did not show himself.</p><p>Naturally, this was because Cale did not want to show himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Young master-nim, they are all calling for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mary, they are calling you too.&rdquo;</p><p>There were cheers for the necromancer in the crowd as well. Of course, there weren&rsquo;t as many as the cheers for Choi Han, however, nobody was cursing her.</p><p>&rsquo;His highness said that he would take care of it.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale felt as if the crown prince had done something.<br>He had told Cale not to worry as they would only receive cheers during this progression. Cale had not asked about it because it was annoying.<br>&ldquo;Still.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale pretended not to see the hesitating Mary as he leaned back into the chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Young master Shield-nim!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Commander Silver Light-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haaaa.&rdquo;<br>He could not help but sigh.<br>&rsquo;Can't they stop with these cheesy nicknames?&rsquo;</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, young master-nim.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I'm not looking outside.&rdquo;</p><p>He bluntly responded back but Mary hesitated for a moment before continuing to speak. Even Raon who was invisible started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Young master-nim, one child is desperately calling for you.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Weak human! It is the same child who shook his shield for you last time! I thought he would grow well and he did grow quite a bit in just a few months!</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Damn it.&rsquo;<br>Cale frowned quite a bit before moving toward Mary's side. He then peeked out the window.</p><p>&rsquo;Aigoo.&rsquo;<br>He could see the child who had an even fancier shield than last time.<br>Cale remembered this child.</p><p>&rsquo;You won&rsquo;t be cool at all if you are like me.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;Take after your father instead. Only your parents are cool enough to hug you and lift you up like this.&rsquo;</p><p>This child had made him speak nonsense as he was nervous.<br>Cale looked toward the father-son duo who shook their shields fervently once they made eye contact with him before moving back to a corner of the carriage.</p><p>He then put his hand up to his face.</p><p>The number of shields had increased.<br>He could see people with silver shields, swords painted black, and even some wearing black robes as they cheered.<br>However, the number of shields was more than the others.</p><p>&rsquo;...Damn it.</p><p>What if the shield becomes even more trendy?&rsquo;<br>Cale's expression turned serious. He turned to the side to see Mary. He knew Choi Han would be looking cool as he walked in the front as well.</p><p>&rsquo;I need to make sure to show off the two of them this time.</p><p>If I do that and make the Dark Elves heroes as a group...<br>If we manage an overwhelming victory...<br>They will definitely forget about me.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale who had heard about the number of troops heading toward the Caro Kingdom from Guardian Knight Clopeh dilligently, no, desperately thought about it over and over.</p><p>&rsquo;Let&rsquo;s take a back seat this time. Let&rsquo;s use less of my power this time. Let&rsquo;s not use the shield if I don't have to.</p><hr><p>Those were the thoughts in his head as he teleported to the Caro Kingdom and had to greet someone.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I knew you would be here now. Long time no see.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale was shocked.</p><p>The Caro Kingdom had requested reinforcements from the Roan Kingdom as well as the Mogoru Empire, the nation closest to them.<br>The two nations naturally agreed to send reinforcements.</p><p>Cale had thought about the reinforcements the Empire would send.<br>He was quite curious as to how the Empire would act and what kind of reinforcements they would send, since the Empire was on the same side as the Indomitable Alliance.</p><p>However, this person was not in his calculations.</p><p>&ldquo;...Have you been well, your highness, Imperial Prince-nim?&rdquo;</p><p>The Mogoru Empire&rsquo;s Imperial Prince Adin was smiling at Cale who was standing on top of the teleportation magic circle.</p><p>&rsquo;Why is this bastard here?<br>What about the Empire? Don't you need to defend the Empire?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale was flabbergasted.<br>The Imperial Prince smiled as he responded back.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Congratulations on the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s victory.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale held back a scoff.</p><p>&rsquo;Been well my ass.<br>You&rsquo;ve probably been unable to sleep in anger after seeing the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s victory.&rsquo;<br>He didn&rsquo;t need to see it to know that this two-faced bastard was angry about it.</p><p>However, Cale smiled back toward the Imperial Prince. It was unexpected that he ran into the Imperial Prince here at the Caro Kingdom.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you been well, young master Cale?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale responded back to the Imperial Prince happier than ever.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, your highness. I can stretch my legs and sleep well at night thanks to our victory.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale could see the corner of the Imperial Prince's lips shaking a bit.</p><p>He felt good doing this.</p><p>His smile became wider thinking about how there will be many other things in the future that would make him feel good.</p><ul><li>Weak human, it&rsquo;s been a while since you've smiled like this! Are you about to scam someone?</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Scam? No. I'm just smiling.&rsquo;<br>Cale simply let Raon&rsquo;s comments in one ear and out the other.</p> <a href="./chapter211.html" class="chapter-nav">
