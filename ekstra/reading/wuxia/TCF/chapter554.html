<p>A dull noise echoed in the hall along with the black smoke.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The two people&rsquo;s bodies slammed into the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! Why did you suddenly use your wind, w, what the...?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton groaned at the sudden impact and her eyes opened wide as she tried to look at Cale.</p>
<p>Her eyes were focused on the black smoke on top of the platform.</p>
<p>The black smoke was spreading thick and quickly, looking as if it could fill the whole area in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the other person who also crashed into the wall... Cale glared at Gersey who was on the other side of the black door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was almost tricked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then looked back at the black smoke.</p>
<p>This black smoke must have been the way to provide the feed to the monsters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can't get out of the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black smoke only roamed around the platform and did not flow out of it.</p>
<p>Cotton walked up to the platform and tapped on the air.</p>
<p>Tang tang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like there is a transparent barrier separating the platform and the area underneath the platform once the black smoke came out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She roamed around the platform and nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it needs to be like this so that Gersey can provide the feed and then he and his subordinates could safely get out.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t it seem like it would be impossible to steal the sculptures like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale got up and headed next to Cotton. He was now underneath the platform.</p>
<p>Gersey who was outside the black door could not see him.</p>
<p>However, Gersey clicked his tongue as if he could see what was going on. He had more blood flowing out from his mouth than Eruhaben did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How disappointing. I guess I have no choice but to overdo it a bit.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hehehe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his head after hearing someone laugh.</p>
<p>Bud was laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sad that you failed to give the feed to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corners of Gersey&rsquo;s lips started to go up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But thanks to that, you are unable to steal nor destroy the sculptures.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud who didn't know about the black smoke and the transparent barrier started to frown while Gersey laughed and turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you're here, your majesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eruhaben&rsquo;s eyes started to sink.</p>
<p>The White Star was walking over in the distance.</p>
<p>He spoke to Bud in his mind while Gersey greeted the White Star.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is bad. Looks like we need to escape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bud silently nodded his head.</p>
<p>He heard the White Star's voice at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so noisy starting the first day of the festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eruhaben retorted back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only loud because you are making it that way, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hahaha, is that so? Well, it looks like I need to get rid of you first before Cale Henituse can steal those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>A red sword shot out from the White Star&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will destroy the wall, your majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gersey grabbed his fan and charged toward the gold wall.</p>
<p>Tatap!</p>
<p>He lightly kicked off the ground, jumped up into the air, and struck down with the hand holding the fan.</p>
<p>The fan touched the gold wall.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang-!</p>
<p>The fan started to shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gersey stumbled as he landed on the ground.</p>
<p>The large cave started to shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That shaking had started from inside the black door.</p>
<p>Gersey instantly thought about something.</p>
<p>Based on Cale Henituse's past actions...</p>
<p>Is he using his ancient powers to destroy it-?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might have used his ancient powers to their limits.</p>
<p>Would the barrier be able to withstand his attack?</p>
<p>Was he planning on destroying this whole cave at the same time?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief Priest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard the White Star scold him at that moment.</p>
<p>"Can&rsquo;t you even feel what power it is?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Power?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gersey looked back toward the black door.</p>
<p>There was a gap on the door, but it was not wide enough to see everything.</p>
<p>However, he could feel the aura flowing out through the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...P, perhaps-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;That &rsquo;perhaps&rsquo; seems to be the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gersey turned pale after hearing the White Star's response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W, why is that honorable power coming right now-&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no longer an issue of their big plan being destroyed.</p>
<p>The honorable power had responded to Cale.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Why? That power should not be able to respond to Cale Henituse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gersey's mind started to turn white.</p>
<p>It looked like both their big plan and the current situation might end up twisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll go first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The White Star walked past Gersey who was somewhat out of it and swung his sword toward the gold wall.</p>
<p>He started to frown.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I never expected that power to respond to Cale Henituse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His relaxed expression had turned urgent.</p>
<p>That was why he was using the sword at full power.</p>
<p>Slash.</p>
<p>The wall was easily split.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eruhaben coughed up blood and moved back.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he had been preparing to escape, so he was not injured too much from the wall breaking.</p>
<p>However, he had no choice but to open his eyes wide and turn around.</p>
<p>&rsquo;How could such an enormous amount of power-!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He could feel a strong power behind his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also heard the White Star&rsquo;s angry shout.</p>
<p>Eruhaben could see the black door and the wall exploding.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton&rsquo;s body was curled up as she was flung out of there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud caught Cotton as he shouted in shock.</p>
<p>"What the hell happened?!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;T, the barrier broke and a weird power- a scary power-&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud was about to urge her to respond until he realized that her body was shaking.</p>
<p>He quickly looked toward where the door had been.</p>
<p>Bud subconsciously started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...What the?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then took a step back.</p>
<p>He had chills all over his body.</p>
<p>It was a natural reaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could see Eruhaben stumbling as he charged forward.</p>
<p>Bud had never seen Eruhaben moving so urgently before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it! No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The White Star was also shouting as he urgently rushed forward and passed Eruhaben.</p>
<p>His face showed both anger and anxiety.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bud finally thought to look for Cale. Cotton had been flung out, but Cale had not.</p>
<p>He overcame the fear that was filling his body and looked back toward that direction.</p>
<p>He saw Cale there.</p>
<p>Cale had plopped on the ground right in front of the thing that was giving him such terrible fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...What the hell is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s eyes opened wide as he sat there on the ground.</p>
<p>He had not been flung out with that explosion just now, but he was on the ground because he fell down.</p>
<p>He lowered his head.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His whole body was shaking.</p>
<p>The unranked monster that had killed all his teammates... A pressure that was much worse than when he had gone up against that monster was overwhelming him.</p>
<p>Cale lifted his head.</p>
<p>The thing giving him that fear was right in front of him.</p>
<p>It was a black hand.</p>
<p>The hand was so large that it could almost touch the ceiling of the hall.</p>
<p>What could be going on?</p>
<p>&rsquo;What is happening all of a sudden?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale recalled his actions just now.</p>
<p>&rsquo;All I did was get close to the platform.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All he did was move toward Cotton who was observing the black smoke and the transparent barrier.</p>
<p>But the black smoke inside the transparent barrier... That had suddenly disappeared and a large black hand shot up from the platform.</p>
<p>The power of that hand made the transparent barrier explode.</p>
<p>And Cale was looking at that black hand right now.</p>
<p>The eight sculptures?</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t paying them any attention right now.</p>
<p>He thought it was weird that they didn't have a scratch on them after such a large explosion, but he had no time to look into that right now.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>His heart was beating as if it wanted to explode and he had chills all over his body.</p>
<p>Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-</p>
<p>The black hand started to move while making that odd noise.</p>
<p>The palm stopped in front of Cale.</p>
<ul>
<li>You disturbed my slumber.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before Cale could even think about the meaning behind those words...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale! Dodge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale's mind was filled by a voice that seemed to come from the black hand as Eruhaben shouted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here is another punk who has found a way out of god&rsquo;s hand and escaped his fate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The black hand reached out and surrounded Cale while making an eerie noise.</p>
<p>Cale had instantly fallen into darkness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Bang, bang bang!</p>
<p>Lock had a confused expression after hearing someone banging on the door.</p>
<p>The Tiger warriors stationed outside would not knock like this.</p>
<p>"Who could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lock debated whether he should open the door or not. He wondered if he should call the adults who were all gathered in the strategy room.</p>
<p>He heard a voice from the other side of the door at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please open the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Huh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He recognized the voice.</p>
<p>It made sense why the Tiger warriors would have let this person through.</p>
<p>Lock quickly opened the door as he was relieved that it was someone he knew and welcomed the person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cage-nim!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Huff. Huff. Huff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage was outside the door trying to catch her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lock warmly welcomed her but Cage didn&rsquo;t even respond to his greeting as she urgently rushed into the black castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did something-&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lock was trying to ask what was going on in shock before stiffening up after seeing what, no, who, was in Cage&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W, wait- this person is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lock who barely managed to get some words out looked toward the person who was being dragged by the collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This person was Saint Jack who looked as if he didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was suddenly dragged here and I don't even know wh-&rdquo;<br>
"Dragon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saint Jack gave an awkward greeting, but... His greeting was drowned out by Cage&rsquo;s shout.</p>
<p>Cage looked toward Lock and started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the Dragon? The Dragon?!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>"A Dragon that can cast long-distance teleportation! Or at least Miss Rosalyn! No, it needs to be a Dragon, a Dragon!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Just what-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Young master Cale was cut!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lock became anxious after suddenly hearing her mention Cale but Cage looked around as if things were urgent before running toward the stairs.</p>
<p>Lock followed behind her as Cage continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know about the vow of death, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage continued to look around as if she couldn't even see Lock who was anxiously following behind her and then resumed speaking.</p>
<p>She seemed to be looking for someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master Cale and I made a vow of death, you know? There&rsquo;s a power you feel gathering around your hand when you make a vow. It is the power that lets you know whether that person kept or broke the vow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the eerie feeling that seeped into the bodies of the people making the vow of death.</p>
<p>"But that was just cut off.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack who had been dragged here without knowing why looked toward her in shock.</p>
<p>However, Cage didn&rsquo;t respond to his question and just continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be someone else who is feeling this right now. He should be feeling that something is weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>They then heard a door opening on the second floor.</p>
<p>Lock turned toward the door.</p>
<p>Choi Han was walking out of the strategy room with a confused yet serious expression.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Didn&rsquo;t hyung say that he had a lot of things to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han who said he had important business to take care of was coming out with a serious expression before finishing his work.</p>
<p>"Ah, Miss Cage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked extremely happy to see Cage. It was as if he had found the person who could answer his question for him.</p>
<p>Choi Han stepped onto the stairs and walked toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Cage, when did you get here? You see, umm, I made a vow of death with Cale-nim once-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;The presence that entered your body when you made the vow disappeared, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han flinched and looked at her.</p>
<p>Cage let go of Saint Jack's collar and continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who make a vow of death are able to tell whether the vow was kept or broken by that power in their body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Death was the result if the vow was broken.</p>
<p>The presence inside the body would tell the other person that the vow was broken and that the other party was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are times the presence itself disappears from a person's body. That means that the vow of death is cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage slowly walked over to Choi Han.</p>
<p>Her voice echoed through the staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one reason that a vow of death would be cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face stiffened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is when the vow becomes useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was only one reason a vow of death would become useless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means that the other person is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All expressions disappeared from Choi Han's face.</p> <a href="./chapter553.html" class="chapter-nav">
