<p>Rustle.<br>
A leaf crumbled under Cale's feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...For such a place to really exist...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mercenary King Bud looked around in disbelief and could not hide his shock.<br>
The group who slowly descended with Raon's flight magic had different emotions as they looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's even bigger than the Underground City!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It really is! Wow! Wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and Hong had their jaws dropped as they looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...I expected it to be similar to the Underground City...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han mumbled as he looked around.</p>
<p>The Dark Elves Underground City had many trees as well. There was even an artificial river.<br>
It was all thanks to magic and Elementals.</p>
<p>Choi Han had looked at that Underground City and thought that it was a nice city.<br>
It was a beautiful city where Dark Elves and humans could live together.</p>
<p>&rsquo;But this place is different.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This village that was multiple times the size of the City of Life could be called natural.<br>
It didn't give off any sense of it being created.<br>
Everything in this region that was surrounded by these large cliffs on all sides looked natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...It&rsquo;s free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han nodded at Bud&rsquo;s description and looked up.</p>
<p>There was a small orb that shined like the sun at the top of this large underground area.<br>
Trees freely grew underneath it.<br>
Flowers and other vegetation were freely growing as well.</p>
<p>It was not all beautiful.<br>
There were some dead and rotting plants and fruits.<br>
However, that was what made it look so natural.</p>
<p>Choi Han slowly turned a full circle.</p>
<p>This place was quiet, but full of life and freedom.<br>
Paradise was definitely a fitting word for this place.<br>
It didn't seem like the place to have wars nor anything of the sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han kept turning until he made eye contact with Cale. He subconsciously started to share his sentiments about this place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place is beautiful.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Do you feel that way even after seeing that over there?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Choi Han could see Cale's stiff expression.<br>
He looked toward the place Cale pointed out.</p>
<p>Cale was pointing at a spot near the cave that the group just came from.</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at the cliff with the cave.<br>
His expression stiffened up after looking at it.</p>
<p>He had not noticed it when they had descended close to the cliff.<br>
He had just thought that it was a rough cliff.<br>
It was because all of the other sides of the cliff looked normal.<br>
Bud who looked at the cliff as well started to frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Are those letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were large lines on the cliff.<br>
The lines looked so clear that they seemed as if they would never disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...This.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud started to step backward.</p>
<p>Just a bit farther.<br>
He needed to get farther away from the cliff.</p>
<p>He would be able to tell what these lines portrayed if he stepped back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud took many steps back before he could see the words written on the cliff.<br>
They were written in the Eastern continent&rsquo;s common language.</p>
<p>Bud read the words on the top row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Become strong. Then save the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a sword.<br>
He was certain that a sword was used to write these words on the cliff.<br>
The person who did this had to at least be a sword master.<br>
No, forget whether they could use aura or not, this person was extremely skilled in sword arts.</p>
<p>Bud drank some alcohol to wet his dry throat.<br>
It could not be helped.<br>
Underneath the first row that he read...<br>
There were other words that he had not read yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...These look like they were written by someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The style and calligraphy of the words underneath were different.</p>
<p>These people were able to write on the cliffs with swords as if they were using pens.<br>
They needed to be extremely skilled to be able to do that.</p>
<p>He looked toward the others.<br>
They had all been able to read the Mercenaries Guild&rsquo;s directory using Eruhaben&rsquo;s translation magic.<br>
They should have seen these words as well.</p>
<p>However, Bud still read the other words written on the cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will rule the world. Do not resent me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first row.</p>
<p>&lt; Become strong. Then save the world. &gt;</p>
<p>The row underneath it.</p>
<p>&lt; I will rule the world. Do not resent me. &gt;</p>
<p>Bud could not tell who wrote the first row.<br>
However, he felt as if he could tell who wrote the second row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...The White Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was certain that the White Star, the last Dragon Slayer, wrote those words.<br>
He probably wrote it for the villagers right before he went to destroy Sheritt&rsquo;s castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is...beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud could hear Cale's disapproving voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear any birds nor insects. All I see are vegetation, a fake sun, and these suffocating cliffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud made eye contact with Cale.<br>
Cale casually commented with a stoic expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strongest people in the world must have been frustrated with having to live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started to walk as he added on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have felt like a prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prison.<br>
Bud could not say anything about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cat got your tongue?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Huh? No, I just-!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud scratched his head as he looked at Cale walk past him.<br>
However, Cale had not been talking to Bud.</p>
<p>He was speaking to the Scary Giant Cobblestone.</p>
<p>However, he did not hear a response.<br>
The ancient powers had been quiet ever since he blocked the White Star's attacks.</p>
<p>However, Cale needed the Super Rock.<br>
The first Dragon Slayer that the Super Rock had protected. He needed information about the first Dragon Slayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem. Cale, in response to your thoughts that this place could feel like a prison... I-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale made Bud shut up.<br>
Bud looked toward Cale with sorrow, but Cale just motioned to Raon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the center.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked up above the lush forest.</p>
<p>He could see a tall stone building standing between the trees.<br>
It was surrounded by vines, but he could still tell that it was a building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the village should be located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swoooooooosh-</p>
<p>The Sound of the Wind gathered around Cale's feet.<br>
He kicked off the ground.<br>
The others followed behind him.</p>
<p>Shhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Cale moved forward while pushing aside the leaves.<br>
This place that nobody touched for a thousand years felt like a jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han pointed in front of him.<br>
On and Hong who were both jumping through the trees shouted as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there's a village up there!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I can see buildings!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Human! It's over there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale was already looking at the place Raon was pointing at with both paws.</p>
<p>He could see a large open area.<br>
It was the center of the forest.</p>
<p>He could see buildings made of stone or wood.<br>
The buildings were so old that they were crumbling or covered in vegetation.<br>
There were two large statues at the entrance of this village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are swordsmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The large statues were of swordsmen kneeling on one knee.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Choi Han took out his sword.</p>
<p>Paat!</p>
<p>The eyes of the two statues flashed.</p>
<p>&rsquo;There are guardians I created at the village entrance. They are there to protect the village.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Everybody recalled one of the things that Lord Sheritt had said.</p>
<p>Boooom-!<br>
Boom!</p>
<p>The two statue guardians raised their bodies that were covered in vines after being abandoned for 1,000 years.</p>
<p>Crackle!<br>
Crack!</p>
<p>The vines surrounding their bodies started to rip away.<br>
The two statue swordsmen took out their large stone swords at the same time.<br>
The points of those swords were pointing toward Cale's group.</p>
<p>However, Cale's group did not slow down. In fact, they started to speed up as they got closer to the village.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The guardians started to move. They got into a position to defend the village.<br>
These guardians were three times as tall as Choi Han.<br>
They raised their swords high into the sky.</p>
<p>As their swords headed back down...</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll see you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale charged forward.<br>
Choi Han&rsquo;s sword swung down vertically in response.</p>
<p>Slaaaaaash!</p>
<p>The vines blocking Cale's way were slashed away by Choi Han&rsquo;s aura.<br>
There was nothing in Cale&rsquo;s way anymore.</p>
<p>Boooooooong!</p>
<p>A stone sword was slashing down toward Cale.<br>
And then...</p>
<p>Boom!<br>
Boom!</p>
<p>The stone swords fell to the ground.<br>
The guardians started to move at the same time.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The large guardians&rsquo; two knees created craters on the ground.<br>
The swordsmen knelt down.<br>
Their stone swords were stabbed into the ground.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>Between the two guardians.<br>
Cale who was surrounded by wind easily landed on the ground.</p>
<p>Lord Sheritt had said the following.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Once the guardians appear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The white crown was on Cale's head as he descended to the ground.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Cale Henituse, become a king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two guardians lowered their heads toward Cale.</p>
<p>&rsquo;That village is a place for Dragon Slayers. All things there will welcome the return of the king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked past the kneeling statues.</p>
<p>The stone building that he could see from the distance was now fully visible in front of him.</p>
<p>&rsquo;There is a stone building at the center of the village.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale started to walk toward the stone building.</p>
<p>&rsquo;There is a barrier surrounding that building. The first Dragon Slayer and I created it together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a half-transparent barrier surrounding the stone building that was covered in vines.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Plants and water can freely approach that building, but humans and animals cannot get past the barrier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale walked straight forward.<br>
Nothing was getting in his way.</p>
<p>He took a step toward the barrier.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>The white crown on his head started to shake.</p>
<p>Paat!</p>
<p>The barrier surrounding the stone building disappeared at the same time.<br>
He looked back to make sure the others were following him before entering the stone building that nobody had entered for 1,000 years.</p>
<p>&rsquo;That stone building was the first Dragon Slayer&rsquo;s home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a building that only the person with the Dragon Slayer's crown could enter generation after generation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...How interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others looked toward his back after hearing him mumble.<br>
However, Cale did not look back at them as he walked past the old stairs and headed toward the center of the building.</p>
<p>There was an altar at the center of the empty first floor hall.<br>
Cale walked toward the altar as he started to speak again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traces of people have not disappeared even after a thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud's expression stiffened up after hearing that.</p>
<p>They had not seen any skeletons since coming down from the cave. It could be said that they all returned to dust after such a long time, however, there were traces of clothing.</p>
<p>There were traces of children&rsquo;s toys in the plaza as well.<br>
There were no people, but their traces had remained.<br>
Traces that showed that they must have been full of life.</p>
<p>It was as if people who were living peacefully had suddenly met their ends and all that remained for a thousand years were their belongings and traces of them.<br>
Bud started to think that what he described might have actually been how it happened.</p>
<p>He quickly snapped out of it and followed Cale to the altar.</p>
<p>Lord Sheritt had told them about it.<br>
She had said there would be a record book that the first Dragon Slayer created.<br>
She had said that everything would be written inside it.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Look through the record book on top of the altar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said that they would be able to find the White Star&rsquo;s weakness in the book.</p>
<p>&rsquo;That book is something only someone who can put the crown on their head can grab.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bud looked toward the crown on top of Cale&rsquo;s head.<br>
Cale was the only one here who could grab the record book.</p>
<p>Bud could see a very thick book once he approached the altar.<br>
The book that was covered in a thick barrier looked fine even though 10,000 years had passed since the first Dragon Slayer.</p>
<p>It was soon time for this book to end up in Cale's hands.<br>
Bud could feel his heart beating wildly.<br>
It was from excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Cale-nim?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Human?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Bud's expression stiffened after hearing the group calling for Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Hey, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale was standing in front of the altar with an odd expression.<br>
Bud had never seen such an expression on Cale before.</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s face was completely pale.</p>
<p>Cale clenched his fists.<br>
The tips of his fingers were shaking. He brushed his face with his shaking fingers.</p>
<p>He could see the book on top of the altar.<br>
This record book had survived for 10,000 years underneath this barrier.</p>
<p>He could see the title and author written on it.</p>
<p>&rsquo;The Birth of a Hero.<br>
Nelan Barrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It had the same title and author as the book that Kim Rok Soo had laughed at and read until volume 5.</p> <a href="./chapter375.html" class="chapter-nav">
