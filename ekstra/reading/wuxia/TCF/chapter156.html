She seemed to be shocked.<br>That made Cale realize something.</p><p>&rsquo;It is not an ordinary item.&rsquo;</p><p>Jack started to speak as if he knew what Cale was thinking about.</p><p>&rsquo;It is a divine item.&rsquo; <span id="footnote-ref-0e25"><a href="#footnote-0e25">[1]</a></span></p><p>A divine item.<br>An item gifted by the god.<br>The thief that was the owner of the Sound of the Wind ancient power had died while running away with a divine item.<br>That was how precious they were. The reason that the secret organization Arm was able to kill the strong Blue Wolf tribe was because they had a divine item.</p><p>That was why Cale was excited as he asked.</p><p>&rsquo;Where is the Condemnation of the Sun located? I will retrieve it.&rsquo;</p><p>However, Jack shook his head with a bitter expression.</p><p>&rsquo;I do not know.&rsquo;</p><p>Jack had only heard about the existence of divine items while being taught by the pope the ways of a Saint. After that, the pope responded to Jack's questions of, &rsquo;Are there divine items?&rsquo; with, &rsquo;Divine items? Something like that does not exist.&rsquo;</p><p>The fake Holy Maiden, Hannah, who had been quietly listening to Jack, let out a scoff.</p><p>&rsquo;The Pope said that it does not exist. That means that it is definitely somewhere. That greedy old man probably hid it somewhere safe.&rsquo;</p><p>Jack said something interesting at that moment.</p><p>&rsquo;However, the Pope would not have been able to use the divine item even if he knew where it was located.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;Why is that?&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;The Popes have not directly been appointed by the Sun God since the Pope from about 500 years ago. The rest since then were all selected in a meeting by the church&rsquo;s leaders.&rsquo;</p><p>Hannah put on another smirk.</p><p>&rsquo;Meeting of leaders my ass. It was more of an ugly fight for power.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale listened to the crazy priestess, the Saint, and the fake Holy Maiden chat for a while before asking Jack a question.</p><p>&rsquo;What kind of divine item is the Condemnation of the Sun?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale set a goal for this trip after hearing Jack&rsquo;s response.</p><p>He decided to steal it if he got lucky enough to find it.</p><p>&rsquo;But I don't really have a way to find it.&rsquo;</p><p>There was no way Cale would know the location when neither the Saint nor the Holy Maiden knew about it. That was why he added the part about luck.</p><p>Tap.<br>Cale turned his head toward the hand on his shoulder.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p><p>It was the crown prince.<br>Cale, the rest of the Roan Kingdom's investigation team, and the Empire&rsquo;s administrators all responded to Alberu.</p><p>Cale, Choi Han, Eruhaben, and the Vice Captain all followed behind Alberu as they headed into the Vatican.</p><p>There was still evidence of the explosion in the plaza outside the Vatican.<br>Part of the Vatican itself was still destroyed from the magic bomb as well.</p><p>There was a barricade along the site of the incident along with a large group of people gathered in the plaza just outside the barricade.</p><p>&ldquo;Catch those terrible twins who destroyed the Church and killed our citizens!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Church of the Sun God is disbanded! A church that seeks power is no longer a church!&rdquo;</p><p>Many different voices could be heard.</p><p>&ldquo;Catch and kill those devils who killed the Pope-nim!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Empire does not need the Sun God! The Church of the Sun God that kills people, be gone!&rdquo;</p><p>The Empire had revealed many things about the Church of the Sun God that they had discovered during their terror investigation. As a result, the Vatican was empty because the priests, as well as anybody else that was involved with the Vatican, were all currently under investigation.</p><p>&rsquo;The Empire is quite an interesting place.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale could tell that the Empire's royal family was letting these people do this on purpose. There were bound to be moles from the crown among those people as well.</p><p>However, Cale did not care about it.</p><p>-Human, human! Let&rsquo;s find a lot of treasures!</p><p>Cale slightly nodded his head at Raon's voice.<br>He then lifted his head up.</p><p>He could see the Alchemists&rsquo; Bell Tower which was visible from all locations within the Empire.<br>He could see the tall tower that looked as if it could stab the sun.</p><p>In contrast, the Vatican was quiet and destroyed.</p><p>&rsquo;Ah, so thrilling.&rsquo;</p><p>That was what the fake Holy Maiden, Hannah, had said.</p><p>&rsquo;I told Arm about the secret room. It is a location that only the Pope and the leaders know about. A lot of the Vatican&rsquo;s treasures are located there.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;However, I did not tell them about the secret table inside of the secret room.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;That is the path to the real treasure.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale was more serious than ever before.<br>The path to the treasure. He needed to be focused. Cale had already chatted about things with Alberu.</p><p>&rsquo;Cale Henituse. Let&rsquo;s proceed with the plan on the last day of the investigation.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;Is it because the celebration is the next day?&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;Yes. We will swipe it when the Empire is busy with the preparations.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;Sounds great. Then I guess I need to act like a dedicated investigator until then.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale's solemn expression as he finished recalling the conversation made the Empire's investigation squad members stiffen up.</p><p>Rustle.<br>Cale stepped on some rocks that had fallen off the broken buildings as he slowly entered the Vatican.</p><p>&ldquo;Do we just need to investigate as we want?&rdquo;</p><p>The Empire's administrator lightly nodded his head at Alberu&rsquo;s question.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir. However, we ask that you let us know of the location in advance and have one of us with you at all times.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hmm, is that so? Whatever. We'll do as you have asked.&rdquo;</p><p>The administrator let out a sigh of relief after seeing Alberu not getting upset. Alberu divided up the investigation squad and gave some orders.</p><p>&ldquo;These five people including myself will investigate the central building.&rdquo;</p><p>The central building. The eastern Annex. The western administrative offices. Alberu distributed the team and pointed to the last building as he looked toward Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;Young master Cale Henituse, you and inspector Ben will investigate the rear garden and the tower with the spire behind it.</p><p>Cale and Ben made eye contact.<br>Ben was one of Alberu&rsquo;s secretaries who had been named as an inspector based on his investigation abilities. He was, naturally, a disguised Dark Elf.</p><p>Cale started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not need any other guards as I have three of my knights with me, your highness.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu nodded his head as if that was not an issue.</p><p>&ldquo;Do as you like. You, Ben, and an administrator from the Empire. Three knights should be fine for the three of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu gave the order for all of them to start moving.<br>Cale put Ben in front of him and slowly headed to the garden.</p><p>&rsquo;There is nothing in the garden.&rsquo;</p><p>The fake Holy Maiden, Hannah, had said that there was nothing of value in the garden.<br>Cale could see the Empire's administrator smiling awkwardly as soon as they entered the garden.</p><p>&ldquo;...Mm, it is pretty ugly isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>The administrator could see the flowers that were trampled. There were also blood stains, making it look more like a battlefield rather than a garden. The administrator could not help but smile awkwardly to show them such a terrible sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale started to speak to the administrator.</p><p>&ldquo;It just makes me sad to think about that terrible moment.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>The administrator recalled that this young master in front of him was the one who put himself in harm&rsquo;s way in order to defend his kingdom. He leaned his ear toward the just noble&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;I pray that we can find the perpetrators in order to console the souls of the dead as well as the hearts of those they left behind.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Those are very touching words.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale acted like a just noble as he walked through the garden. He could see the tower behind the garden. There was a very small window at the top of it.</p><p>The administrator started to speak once he noticed that Cale's gaze was on the tower.</p><p>&ldquo;It is said that there was a heretic when the Vatican was created hundreds of years ago. They supposedly locked the heretic up at the top of the tower.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale had heard this from Jack as well.</p><p>&ldquo;It is a building with a staircase leading up to the top and nothing else. It is a pretty useless building. It has not been used for a couple hundred years.&rdquo;</p><p>That was what Hannah had said as well.</p><p>&rsquo;...But what is going on?&rsquo;</p><p>Boom! Boom!<br>His heart was beating wildly.</p><p>It had started from the moment he looked at the tower. Cale kept his gaze on the tower as he started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Ben, let us split up and look. I will go toward the tower.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes sir. I understand.&rdquo;</p><p>The Empire's administrator retreated to the entrance of the garden and started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Please take your time. I will be right here.&rdquo;</p><p>It meant that he would be watching them.</p><p>Cale did not say anything as he started to walk toward the tower.</p><p>&ldquo;What is going on, Cale-nim?&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han was following behind Cale.<br>Hilsman was with Ben while Eruhaben was with the Empire&rsquo;s administrator.</p><p>Cale casually responded to Choi Han&rsquo;s question.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, my heart is just beating.&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Heart?&rsquo;<br>Choi Han seemed to be confused.<br>It was at that moment.</p><p>It was as Cale got closer to the tower.<br>The moment that he could see the only door into this 15-story tower that looked cold and cruel.</p><p>Choi Han saw it.</p><p>&ldquo;Cale-nim, in your hand-&rdquo;</p><p>He could not say the rest as he looked around. He then quickly moved to Cale's side in order to block the view of the Empire's administrator.</p><p>Choi Han then pointed to Cale's right hand.</p><p>Swooooooosh-</p><p>A small gust of wind was forming on Cale's right hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha, haha-&rdquo;</p><p>A low laughter echoed in the area. The quiet laughter was filled with both admiration and shock.<br>It was Cale. Cale could not prevent himself from laughing.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!<br>His heart was beating wildly.</p><p>His feet felt lighter as well.</p><p>It was the Sound of the Wind.<br>The Sound of the Wind was roaring in his mind more than ever before. Cale recalled the information about the former owner of this power.<br>The greatest thief who had stolen a divine item.<br>She was as bold as she was fast.</p><p>Swooooooosh-</p><p>The gust of wind on his hand kept wanting to fly toward the tower.</p><ul><li>Human, what is going on? Why are you causing the wind? Are you trying to destroy the tower with the whirlwind?</li></ul><p>Raon's serious voice echoed in his mind.</p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t do that! I saw your hands shaking last time! The great and mighty Raon Miru can easily destroy a tower like that if you want! I can destroy the palace as well!</li></ul><p>Cale quietly responded back.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t destroy it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>... You are not going to destroy it?</li></ul><p>Choi Han asked with confusion while Raon responded with an oddly disappointed tone.<br>Cale brushed his face with his left hand.</p><p>He recalled the information Jack and Hannah had told him about the tower.</p><p>&rsquo;Although they call her a heretic, the leaders get to know the truth. The woman who was imprisoned in the tower was the last real Holy Maiden.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;You're right. She supposedly tried to reveal the church&rsquo;s wrongdoings, but she failed and ended up having to live the terrible life of being imprisoned in the tower forever.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;The Pope tried to brainwash us from an early age that acting like that Holy Maiden would only lead to a pitiful life.&rsquo;</p><p>The tower where the last real Holy Maiden lived.<br>She had looked down at the church from the small window at the top of the tallest tower in the Vatican.</p><p>Cale remembered the question he had asked Jack, as well as Jack's response.</p><p>&rsquo;What kind of divine item is the Condemnation of the Sun?&rsquo;</p><p>Jack had an awkward smile as he responded back.</p><p>&rsquo;It is the Sun&rsquo;s judgment. Although it is hard to believe...&rsquo;</p><p>He shook his head as he continued to speak.</p><p>&rsquo;It is supposed to prevent the night. A white night. It is said to bring forth a bright night.&rsquo;</p><p>The Condemnation of the Sun.<br>An item that destroys the darkness.<br>It was a divine item that only the Church of the Sun God could own.</p><p>Cale looked toward the tower again.</p><p>It is here.<br>The thief who owned the Sound of the Wind was quietly reaching out to him.</p><p>It is here.<br>The divine item is here.</p><p>Cale started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We will secretly leave the palace tonight.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;···Excuse me?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale didn&rsquo;t even look toward the shocked Choi Han as he started to speak to Raon.</p><p>&ldquo;Raon.&rdquo;<br>-What is it, Human?<br>&ldquo;Show the assassin in my room some illusions tonight. Make him think that I am peacefully sleeping in the room.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>He is pretty strong, so I will need to create a magic circle with a magic stone.<br>&ldquo;Use it.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Cale didn't care.<br>Why would he care about a magic stone when they were going to find a divine item?</p><p>Cale started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Tonight. We will loot this tower tonight.&rdquo;</p><hr><div id="footnote-0e25"><p>1. I changed god&rsquo;s item to divine item.
