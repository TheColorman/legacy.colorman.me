<ul><li>Human, what is it? You are acting odd!</li></ul><p>Cale could not say anything even though Raon's voice filled his mind.</p><p>&rsquo;I've been found out.&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han seemed to have figured everything out.<br>The fact that he mentioned his nephew's friend alone was enough to show that he knew about Choi Jung Soo and Kim Rok Soo. Furthermore, he seemed to have noticed that Kim Rok Soo was the current Cale as well.<br>No, it wasn&rsquo;t that he seemed to have noticed, he knew for sure.</p><p>&ldquo;...Haha.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale started to laugh awkwardly before slowly avoiding Choi Han&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>The cheapskate&rsquo;s fiery thunderbolts were continuing to purify the dead mana and turn it into rose-gold colored ashes as that happened.</p><p>The fiery thunderbolts and the rose gold colored ashes.<br>The combination of this looked beautiful from a distance.<br>However, it was causing people around it to run away as they feared death, although the people at the center were not in a situation to notice what was going on.</p><p>Choi Han started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;...Kim Rok Soo.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han nonchalantly saying his name made Cale look toward a mountain in the distance. Of course, the only things he could see were the fiery thunderbolts that blocked his view.<br>The disappearing black liquids were also there.</p><p>Choi Han just quietly observed Cale.</p><p>&rsquo;...Kim Rok Soo.&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han repeated that name in his mind once more.<br>He then tried to put Cale and Kim Rok Soo together.</p><p>During the time he had been Choi Jung Soo...<br>He had met many people as he followed through Choi Jung Soo's memories in his dream.</p><p>Choi Han had not thought much about it when he met Kim Rok Soo inside the dream. However, the smart Choi Han realized that Kim Rok Soo reminded him of someone as soon as he woke up.</p><p>No, they were the same.<br>That person was Cale Henituse.</p><p>Their way of speaking.<br>Facial expressions.<br>Personality.<br>But most importantly...</p><p>&rsquo;You have to pay for your meals.&rsquo;</p><p>The things Kim Rok Soo had said in the dream...</p><p>&rsquo;My dream is to be a slacker. A rich slacker. If that is difficult, just a regular slacker. Got it?&rsquo;</p><p>Those words overlapped with someone else&rsquo;s statements.<br>He had also seen how both Kim Rok Soo and Cale Henituse used the 'record&rsquo; ability.<br>He also saw how they coughed up blood or ended up in pain after using their abilities.</p><p>Finally, the conversation he saw in Choi Jung Soo&rsquo;s memories...<br>Choi Jung Soo had been chatting with his teammates during a short period of peace.</p><p>&rsquo;Are you reading a fantasy novel again?&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;Unfortunately, not this time.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;Huh? It really isn&rsquo;t a fantasy novel. It&rsquo;s rare for you to read anything else.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;It happens every so often.&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Jung Soo smiled at his sunbae before making eye contact with Kim Rok Soo who was next to him.</p><p>&rsquo;Hey, do I look a bit smart?&rsquo;</p><p>Kim Rok Soo just shook his head sideways at Choi Jung Soo.</p><p>&rsquo;Ahem.&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Jung Soo didn't care about Kim Rok Soo's response as he continued to speak.</p><p>&rsquo;My family researched ancient sword arts and martial arts for generations. Since my ability is related to the sword as well, I thought about creating a new sword art that fits the modern world! Isn&rsquo;t that cool? Ahh, I can feel just how cool I am.&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;...Sigh.&rsquo;</p><p>Kim Rok Soo had sighed before looking at the book in Choi Jung Soo&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&rsquo;What does creating your sword art have to do with a book on pure Korean?&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s very important! Hey, the name is everything! Look, look, there are a lot of great pure Korean words!&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Jung Soo opened the book. He then smiled as he looked at a word on the page he opened.</p><p>&rsquo;Oh look, there&rsquo;s a great word as soon as I opened it! I'm going to use our cool pure Korean words to come up with a name for my sword art. Being cool is the best! Hahahaha!&rsquo;</p><p>That page had pure Korean words starting with, &rsquo;&#12601;, and &#12609;.&rsquo; <span id="footnote-ref-924a"><a href="#footnote-924a">[1]</a></span><br>Choi Han had seen it because Choi Jung Soo had seen it.</p><p>Two words were clearly visible on the page.<br>Raon and Miru.<br>Joyful Dragon.</p><p>&rsquo;Choi Han! I like my name the best and it is great! Raon Miru! I am the great and mighty Raon Miru!&rsquo;</p><p>He recalled how happy the black Dragon had been that Cale had given him a name.<br>Choi Han did not know that Raon was a pure Korean word before seeing it.<br>However, Choi Han came to a realization after all of the information gathered in his mind.</p><p>Kim Rok Soo and Cale Henituse might be the same person.</p><p>That thought filled him with all sorts of emotions.<br>Shock, anger, happiness, sorrow, and joy.<br>Choi Han had never felt so many emotions overwhelm him as he did during the short duration of time it took to wake up and teleport here.</p><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s hand headed to his scabbard.<br>He touched the sword that Cale had given him.<br>He tightly grabbed onto the scabbard.</p><p>There was something that came to his mind through all of those emotions...<br>It suddenly hit him.<br>It was a thought that truly did suddenly pop into his mind.</p><p>&rsquo;Cale-nim...<br>Did he come here by choice like Choi Jung Soo could have done? If not, how did he end up here?&rsquo;</p><p>The God of Death had given Choi Jung Soo a choice to come to this world.</p><p>&rsquo;Did Cale-nim, did Kim Rok Soo make a similar choice?<br>Or did Cale end up here unexpectedly as he had?&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han continued to think without saying anything.</p><p>Click. Click.</p><p>His eyes looked deep in thought as he slowly touched the scabbard.</p><p>&rsquo;Damn it!&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s actions made Cale scared.</p><p>Click. Click.</p><p>Every time Choi Han touched his scabbard with the deep look in his eyes...</p><p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p><p>Cale's heart was beating wildly. Cale&rsquo;s shoulders unintentionally curled slightly forward in fear.<br>He started to think.</p><p>&rsquo;Is he going to beat me up with the scabbard?&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Why did you trick me? Huh? Why didn&rsquo;t you say anything? You damn punk who is much younger than I am! You tricked me all this time when you are my nephew&rsquo;s friend? Huh?&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Is he going to say something like that as he beats me up?&rsquo;</p><ul><li>Both the human and Choi Han are acting weird!</li></ul><p>Raon's words could not reach Cale right now.<br>Cale was looking at the fire as he peeked toward Choi Han&rsquo;s scabbard every so often.</p><p>&rsquo;...Ah, damn it, do I just close my eyes and let him hit me?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale started to debate what to do.<br>It was at that moment.</p><ul><li>...I'm working hard to purify the dead mana.<br>&ldquo;Cale-nim.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Cale ignored the cheapskate after hearing the cheapskate and Choi Han&rsquo;s voice at the same time.<br>He better do a good job at purifying after gobbling up all that money.</p><p>&ldquo;...Huh? What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>He awkwardly asked back.</p><ul><li>...Human, are you trying to scam Choi Han? Why are you being weird and putting on that fake good guy expression? Something is weird! Don&rsquo;t scam Choi Han! You can use it on the White Star!</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Like hell I'm trying to scam him!&rsquo;</p><p>The corners of Cale's lips slightly shook after hearing Raon's comments.<br>He heard Choi Han's calm voice at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Kimchi, cup ramen, pork belly, green onion pancakes, veggie tempura.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale subconsciously responded with a blank expression.<br>It could not be helped.</p><p>&ldquo;Don't you want to eat those things? You seemed to eat them a lot.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Gochujang, doenjang-jjigae, jokbal. <span id="footnote-ref-7b76"><a href="#footnote-7b76">[2]</a></span> You don't crave them?&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han was smiling as he gently asked, and Cale blankly responded.</p><p>&ldquo;...Of course, I do?&rdquo;</p><p>Who wouldn't?<br>Even though he never brought it up, who wouldn't want to eat things they grew up eating but have not been able to enjoy for a few years?<br>Cale looked toward Choi Han with an expression that seemed to be asking why he was asking such an odd question.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha, hahahaha-&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han started to laugh.<br>He then suddenly stopped laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;It looks like we need to have a long and deep conversation alone in a quiet location.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han was speaking gently, but Cale became scared.</p><p>Click. Click.</p><p>It was because Choi Han was still touching the scabbard as he said that without even the slightest trace of a smile on his face.</p><p>Choi Han stared at Cale for a moment before continuing to speak.</p><p>"Will you honestly tell me everything?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale didn't even hesitate for a second as he responded.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you asking such an obvious question?&rdquo;</p><p>How could he hide anything when it looked like Choi Han had already figured everything out?<br>Choi Han chuckled at the grumbling Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;There is something I wish to ask right now though. Is that okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale nodded his head.<br>Choi Han opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>However, he could not say anything.<br>Cale turned his head.</p><p>Baaaaang! Bang! Baaaaang!</p><p>A formless power was destroying the fiery thunderbolts and the path of fire every time Dorph punched.<br>The red pillar was slowly breaking down, allowing them to be able to see Dorph&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t let you burn all of that precious dead mana.&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph smiled with a relaxed expression and Cale could see the ground behind Dorph.</p><p>&ldquo;This bastard!&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah sent out another aura attack toward Dorph&rsquo;s back.<br>Cale could see that Hannah had minor injuries all over her body.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my, so energetic.&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph half-heartedly swung his fist toward the back.</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah barely managed to defend against Dorph's formless attack with the face of her sword. However, her body was sent flying back to the roof of the tower.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Hannah managed to somehow land on both feet.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm going to kill that bastard!&rdquo;</p><p>She then shouted toward Cale who was visible through the pillar of fire that Dorph was breaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Hehe, truly a passionate swordsman.&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph chuckled before starting to destroy the fire and the thunderbolts again.</p><p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>The explosions continued and Cale made eye contact with Choi Han.</p><p>&ldquo;It looks like we have to fight?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale casually commented and Choi Han responded calmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, let me ask just one thing bef-&rdquo;</p><p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Choi Han had to stop talking again because of the sound of Dorph punching.</p><p>&ldquo;Hehe, it looks like it is Choi Han standing next to you. Seeing another warrior makes me want to fight fair and square again! What do you say we take care of Cale Henituse and then fight?&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph shouted with joy as he continued to punch.</p><p>Baaaaang!<br>Bang! Baaaaang!</p><p>A fiery thunderbolt was destroyed with each punch. Dorph was slowly approaching Cale's location.<br>Choi Han quickly resumed speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Cale-nim, the thing I am curious about-&rdquo;</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>&ldquo;I'll just ask about that before I go. Only then will I be at pea-&rdquo;</p><p>Bang! Baaaaang!</p><p>Dorph shouted as he continued to punch.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the last one!&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han resumed speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Going back-&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph slammed down on the pillar of fire at that moment.</p><p>Baaaaaaaaaang!</p><p>A loud explosion much louder than the others echoed out.<br>Cale could see a large hole through the fire.<br>Dorph stepped into the center area where Cale was standing through the hole as he smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Finally, the place to fight has-&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You're being so loud.&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph had no choice but to raise his arms and curl his body before he got to finish what he was saying.</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>A violent black aura slammed down on Dorph.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, you truly are strong.&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph lowered his arms as he smiled at Choi Han. However, he had to quickly raise them back up to guard.</p><p>Baaaaaang! Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>Black aura continued to attack Dorph without stopping.<br>Dorph could hear Choi Han&rsquo;s voice.<br>His voice was calm but cold.</p><p>&ldquo;You are being too loud. Why don&rsquo;t you shut the f*ck up?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale could see Choi Han speaking to Dorph with a vicious expression on his face.</p><p>&rsquo;...So, who told him to make so much noise when other people were talking?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale clicked his tongue as he looked at Dorph.<br>&rsquo;He&rsquo;s going to get beaten to a pulp now.&rsquo;</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Choi Han took out his sword.</p><p>&rsquo;Vicious bastard.&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han had attacked Dorph with aura around his scabbard until now.<br>Cale shouted while looking at Choi Han who took his sword out to fight for real.</p><p>&ldquo;Fighting!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han chuckled at Cale speaking Korean. He then turned around and looked at Cale.<br>Cale continued to speak with a serious expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I ask you something too?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That, if you are Jung Soo's paternal cousin once removed, shouldn&rsquo;t I treat you as a respected elder?&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han looked shocked, but Cale was being serious.<br>It'd be one thing if Choi Han was an ancestor from a few generations ago, but he couldn&rsquo;t keep talking so casually to an elder of Jung Soo's family from the generation right above them.<br>It happened as Choi Han opened and closed his mouth a few times without being able to say anything.</p><p>&ldquo;If you get distracted while facing me-&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph charged toward Choi Han.</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>Choi Han sent out another aura attack before looking at Dorph with an annoyed expression.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you that you are being too loud.&rdquo;</p><p>He then responded to Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;I don't need that.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t need to be treated as an elder.<br>Something like that was not necessary.<br>Choi Han pushed aside the conversation with Cale for the time being and moved toward Dorph.</p><p>The thing he wanted to ask Cale was the following.</p><p>&rsquo;Cale-nim, are you happy that you ended up here? Do you not regret it?&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han kept that to himself for now as he raised his sword.</p><p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>The Lion King and Choi Han, the sword master.<br>The fist and the sword started to properly clash against each other.</p><p>Cale started to think as he watched them fight.</p><p>&rsquo;Ah, what a relief.<br>That bastard will get beaten up on my behalf.&rsquo;</p><ul><li>Human! Why do you suddenly have a happy smile on your face?</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Looks like Choi Han is not as angry with me as I thought.<br>He really is a good guy.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale could only think that Choi Han was a very understanding and good person.</p><p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>Cale calmed down hearing the sound of fighting echoing around him.</p><hr><div id="footnote-924a"><p>1. 2 Korean consonants <a href="#footnote-ref-924a"><svg class="svg-inline--fa fa-hand-point-left fa-w-16" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="far" data-icon="hand-point-left" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" data-fa-i2svg=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M0 220.8C0 266.416 37.765 304 83.2 304h35.647a93.148 93.148 0 0 0 7.929 22.064c-2.507 22.006 3.503 44.978 15.985 62.791C143.9 441.342 180.159 480 242.701 480H264c60.063 0 98.512-40 127.2-40h2.679c5.747 4.952 13.536 8 22.12 8h64c17.673 0 32-12.894 32-28.8V188.8c0-15.906-14.327-28.8-32-28.8h-64c-8.584 0-16.373 3.048-22.12 8H391.2c-6.964 0-14.862-6.193-30.183-23.668l-.129-.148-.131-.146c-8.856-9.937-18.116-20.841-25.851-33.253C316.202 80.537 304.514 32 259.2 32c-56.928 0-92 35.286-92 83.2 0 8.026.814 15.489 2.176 22.4H83.2C38.101 137.6 0 175.701 0 220.8zm48 0c0-18.7 16.775-35.2 35.2-35.2h158.4c0-17.325-26.4-35.2-26.4-70.4 0-26.4 20.625-35.2 44-35.2 8.794 0 20.445 32.712 34.926 56.1 9.074 14.575 19.524 27.225 30.799 39.875 16.109 18.374 33.836 36.633 59.075 39.596v176.752C341.21 396.087 309.491 432 264 432h-21.299c-40.524 0-57.124-22.197-50.601-61.325-14.612-8.001-24.151-33.979-12.925-53.625-19.365-18.225-17.787-46.381-4.95-61.05H83.2C64.225 256 48 239.775 48 220.8zM448 360c13.255 0 24 10.745 24 24s-10.745 24-24 24-24-10.745-24-24 10.745-24 24-24z"></path></svg><!-- <i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i> --></a></p></div><div id="footnote-7b76"><p>2. different Korean foods. <a href="#footnote-ref-7b76"><svg class="svg-inline--fa fa-hand-point-left fa-w-16" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="far" data-icon="hand-point-left" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" data-fa-i2svg=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M0 220.8C0 266.416 37.765 304 83.2 304h35.647a93.148 93.148 0 0 0 7.929 22.064c-2.507 22.006 3.503 44.978 15.985 62.791C143.9 441.342 180.159 480 242.701 480H264c60.063 0 98.512-40 127.2-40h2.679c5.747 4.952 13.536 8 22.12 8h64c17.673 0 32-12.894 32-28.8V188.8c0-15.906-14.327-28.8-32-28.8h-64c-8.584 0-16.373 3.048-22.12 8H391.2c-6.964 0-14.862-6.193-30.183-23.668l-.129-.148-.131-.146c-8.856-9.937-18.116-20.841-25.851-33.253C316.202 80.537 304.514 32 259.2 32c-56.928 0-92 35.286-92 83.2 0 8.026.814 15.489 2.176 22.4H83.2C38.101 137.6 0 175.701 0 220.8zm48 0c0-18.7 16.775-35.2 35.2-35.2h158.4c0-17.325-26.4-35.2-26.4-70.4 0-26.4 20.625-35.2 44-35.2 8.794 0 20.445 32.712 34.926 56.1 9.074 14.575 19.524 27.225 30.799 39.875 16.109 18.374 33.836 36.633 59.075 39.596v176.752C341.21 396.087 309.491 432 264 432h-21.299c-40.524 0-57.124-22.197-50.601-61.325-14.612-8.001-24.151-33.979-12.925-53.625-19.365-18.225-17.787-46.381-4.95-61.05H83.2C64.225 256 48 239.775 48 220.8zM448 360c13.255 0 24 10.745 24 24s-10.745 24-24 24-24-10.745-24-24 10.745-24 24-24z"></path></svg><!-- <i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i> --></a></p></div> <a href="./chapter415.html" class="chapter-nav">
