<p>&rsquo;Why did this Vampire come here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale was shocked.<br>
He thought this Vampire was going to send him an invitation, and furthermore, how the hell did he know he was here?</p>
<p>Flutter.</p>
<p>The black bird didn&rsquo;t care whether Cale was shocked or not and slightly flew up and moved elsewhere.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>The bird landed on Alberu Crossman's bed.</p>
<p>Chhhhh!</p>
<p>The black bird opened up its shiny beautiful black wings and with some elegant movements...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your highness, Alberu Crossman. Nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It greeted Alberu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Duke Fredo Von Ejellan of the Endable Kingdom. I currently lead the Vampires of the two continents.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hooo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu quietly mumbled in amazement before slightly bowing toward the black bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu was speaking somewhat respectfully to follow the proper etiquette of addressing a foreign nation's Duke. The black bird&rsquo;s eyes slightly curled up in response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished to meet your highness at some point, but I apologize for suddenly barging in like this.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Not at all. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Your highness, you truly are as wise and benevolent as I've heard.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hahaha! Duke Fredo, you are the one who seems quite wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Oh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked toward the black bird and Alberu who were chatting peacefully with each other in disbelief.<br>
Alberu noticed Cale's gaze and started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little brother, have you ever thought about learning such cool etiquette like Duke Fredo's?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;What nonsense is this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale just said whatever came to mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I plan on being a slacker, so I don't think I&rsquo;ll have anywhere to use that etiquette even if I learned them.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu sighed.<br>
Cale found Alberu&rsquo;s pitying gaze to be odd.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...Why is he looking at me like that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Although he didn't know the reason, it made him feel extremely iffy that Cale slightly started to frown as he looked at Alberu.<br>
Alberu shook his head and then started to speak toward Duke Fredo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Based on what I heard, Duke Fredo was unconscious. Are you okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Alberu started to smile.<br>
He had a sharp gaze toward Duke Fredo as if they had not been speaking peacefully to each other at all.<br>
The black bird who received his observing gaze directly shared his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooo. You've heard about my condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swish.</p>
<p>The black bird turned toward Cale.<br>
The black bird&rsquo;s eyes flashed as they looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm extremely curious as to how his highness knew about my condition. My current condition should have been a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale just shrugged his shoulders toward the black bird.</p>
<p>&rsquo;There&rsquo;s no need to tell him that the Wind Elementals told me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to share that information with someone who was not his ally.<br>
Duke Fredo seemed to notice this as he did not ask further.</p>
<p>Flutter.</p>
<p>He flapped his wings and flew up into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your highness, if it is okay with you, may I have a conversation with young master Cale Henituse in secret?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Of course. Do whatever you need.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Thank you very much, your highness. I will come bade goodbye before I leave.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale observed the bird and the crown prince in a stiff position as he thought to himself.</p>
<p>&rsquo;They work well off each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale chuckled and got up from his seat.</p>
<p>He was the one Duke Fredo wanted to chat with the most.<br>
He had no reason to decline that conversation.<br>
It was even better that he didn&rsquo;t need to go looking for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go chat in my bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They couldn't talk in the reception room nor an office because this was the Stan Lord&rsquo;s Castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke Fredo happily left with Cale.<br>
...While landing on Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What the hell is he doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Duke Fredo who gracefully landed on Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulder with shock.<br>
Duke Fredo didn't care and patted Choi Han's shoulder with his foot before speaking in a satisfied voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm. This shoulder is nice because it is the firmest. This is satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale could see Choi Han's pupils shaking after being taken back by this development.<br>
Duke Fredo who did not notice this at all patted Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulder with his feet again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choi Han, you escort me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale could see something at that moment.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What is up with this bastard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He could tell that Choi Han was swearing in his head just by looking at his eyes.<br>
Cale subconsciously took a step away from Choi Han and headed toward the bedroom door.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human!</li>
</ul>
<p>Raon was invisible and right behind him.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it okay for that fearless Vampire to move around like this after claiming to be unconscious?</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;I know, right?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale kind of bowed toward Alberu who was waving his hand and grabbed the doorknob.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, human, also! You cannot get close to the God of Death at all! The God of Death seems to be cunning! Don&rsquo;t worry, I won't let even a god get away with messing with you!</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;Oops. I forgot about the God of Death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale had forgotten about the God of Death issue because of Duke Fredo's sudden appearance.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Cale turned the doorknob and headed outside.<br>
A couple of Royal Knights were standing a bit away while guarding the area around Alberu&rsquo;s bedroom door. Cale greeted them before starting to walk toward his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master-nim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his head after hearing someone calling his name from behind him.<br>
Cage walked out from behind Choi Han, who was walking with the black bird on his shoulder, and approached Cale.</p>
<p>She stood next to Cale and quietly whispered something in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master-nim, is it fine to consider that you are declining the offer for sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale answered sternly without even a second of hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was one thing to land a punch on the God of Death, but he did not want to move according to a god&rsquo;s will.<br>
Cage blinked a few times after hearing his response before mumbling to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm, I don't know if he&rsquo;ll listen. He&rsquo;s a persistent god. He&rsquo;s such a blockhead that you can't really talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale flinched.</p>
<p>Cage who was mumbling to herself slowly looked up at Cale&rsquo;s face and observed him.</p>
<p>Smile. </p>
<p>She then started to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will figure out a way.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Human! Cage is smiling like when you and the crown prince are scamming someone! No, she&rsquo;s smiling in an even scarier way!</li>
</ul>
<p>That smile soon turned to her usual refreshing smile and she bowed to Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then see you next time.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale watched Cage leave in the opposite direction before his expression turned stiff.<br>
He turned away from Cage and started to walk toward his room.</p>
<p>&rsquo;The God of Death...things are getting annoying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His expression continued to stiffen from the frustration he felt as he thought about his situation.</p>
<p>The invisible Raon and Choi Han... As well as Duke Fredo on Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulder followed quietly behind Cale.<br>
Cale&rsquo;s group could no longer see the area around Alberu's bedroom.<br>
There were many people who had watched them from the beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Wasn't his expression too vicious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of one of the knights in the hallway filled the area.</p>
<p>Peek peek.</p>
<p>The knights guarding the crown prince's room stopped looking solemn and serious and peeked at each other.</p>
<p>&rsquo;This is weird.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;His expression...was very serious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The battle had ended.<br>
But Cale Henituse, the person who could be said was the one to end the battle, had entered the crown prince's bedroom looking weak and down but left with a stiff and serious expression and headed somewhere.<br>
His steps looked firm and urgent.</p>
<p>All of the knights had ominous feelings.<br>
They were the ones who were responsible for guarding the crown prince and protecting the kingdom after all.<br>
That was why they were worried that another war or something big would happen.</p>
<p>The Knight Captain was not there right now, so one of the knights cautiously started to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think...something happened to young master Cale-nim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sunbae knight let out a fake cough before adding on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks that way. He&rsquo;s always working for the Roan Kingdom...he&rsquo;s always busy and unable to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the quietest Knights started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be for the entire world and not just the Roan Kingdom. Didn't you guys see it just now too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knights all looked toward him as it was rare for him to speak.<br>
He usually did not speak because he was a deep thinker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Young master Cale-nim chatting with someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They recalled the person who had just whispered to Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...You mean the lady wearing the priestess robe?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;That madam-, isn&rsquo;t she Lord Stan&rsquo;s close friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knights had not reacted to her being here because they were clear about her identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo;<br>
"What do you mean?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I think I can answer that for you.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knight chatting with the quiet knight looked toward his hoobae knight who had been the first to speak.</p>
<p>Peek peek.</p>
<p>The hoobae knight looked around in order to make sure that they were the only ones there before he cautiously started to speak.<br>
He needed to be even more cautious as this was the Stan Lord&rsquo;s Castle and not the palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady from earlier is indeed Lord Stan's close friend, however...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>He gulped and continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...She is also an excommunicated priestess of the Church of the God of Death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knights who had been quietly listening to him reacted to that statement.</p>
<p>"Excommunicated?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;The God of Death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was because it was difficult and rare for a priestess to be excommunicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She was excommunicated from the church of the God of Death, but you see...&rdquo;</p>
<p>The important information was here.<br>
The hoobae knight shared the story he had heard from his close friend who was a knight at the Stan Lord&rsquo;s Castle.</p>
<p>"She was excommunicated, but the Church of the God of Death does not dare to touch her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shared his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And based on what I've heard, that excommunicated priestess-nim can still use powers like the vow of death that the God of Death gives to his priests.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...How is that possible?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peek peek.</p>
<p>The knight looked around once more before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that the church does not dare to touch that priestess-nim is because the God of Death still considers her to be his child. Such a person came urgently looking for young master Cale-nim. She then chatted so closely with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knight known for being silent started to speak again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially right after that evil White Star bastard told us that thing about young master Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A priestess who was excommunicated but still remained the child of a god.<br>
That priestess urgently came looking for Cale and chatted so closely with him until just a moment ago.</p>
<p>Cale had turned stiff after that conversation.<br>
The White Star had just said that Cale was someone who had received the will of a god.<br>
Of course, the White Star did not say which god it was. He just considered Cale to be an envoy of a god.</p>
<p>Young master Cale was saying that that was not the case, but...</p>
<p>A scenario popped up in the knights&rsquo; minds.<br>
They all subconsciously looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knights all looked toward the quiet Knight. He stood up straight after receiving their gazes and started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just shared my hypothesis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then shut up again.<br>
All of them shut up.<br>
They felt as if they figured out something they were not supposed to know.</p>
<p>Silence filled the hallway once more.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cale closed his bedroom door and looked toward the center of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, why did you come to find me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flutter.</p>
<p>The black bird that elegantly started to flutter its wings on Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulder approached Cale.<br>
It then made eye contact with Cale once it was about a step away.</p>
<p>The bird&rsquo;s beak opened again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, it looks like you'll need to go to the Endable Kingdom with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;...Since when am I your friend?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale was flabbergasted.</p> <a href="./chapter528.html" class="chapter-nav">
