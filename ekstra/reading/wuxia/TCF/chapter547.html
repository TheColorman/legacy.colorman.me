<p>Count Mock who had been heading toward the forest turned around before leaving with Squad 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vice Commander!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, Commander-nim!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You lead Squad 3.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Please leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Squad 3 consisted of Cale, the Vampire warriors, and the Vampire Knights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu walked up to Count Mock and handed him four maps at his calling.<br>
Mock handed those maps to the squad leaders leading the squads heading to the north, east, and west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody remembers the details of the plan?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Mock made eye contact with each person responsible for a squad before saying one thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vice Commander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale raised his hand at Mock's calling.</p>
<p>Three nimble-looking Vampires stepped forward.<br>
Mock looked over them before nodding his head.</p>
<p>"They are informants and people who have each been to the Forest of Darkness at least once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He motioned with his hand and the three Vampires moved so that one of them was with Squad Leaders 1, 2, and 3.<br>
Alberu moved next to Count Mock and Squad 4 at the same time.</p>
<p>Mock finally turned back around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Squad 4 that was made of Dark Elves headed toward the south side of the Black Castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be on our way, sir.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;See you soon, Commander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The noble awaiters who were serving as Squad Leaders for Squads 1 and 2 showed the map to their respective Vampire informants and quickly started to move as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time for us to go too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Squad 3 that Cale was leading started to move toward the west side of the Black Castle as well.</p>
<p>Cale made eye contact with Alberu Crossman who turned around and looked at him before he left.</p>
<p>&rsquo;See you in a bit.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Yes, your highness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two of them communicated with a short eye greeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll look after Alberu Crossman too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cale nodded his head after hearing Eruhaben&rsquo;s voice and started to move toward the west side of the Black Castle.</p>
<p>Shhhhhhh- shhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Squad 3 started to move while matching Naru&rsquo;s movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody should have started moving by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale changed directions as soon as he heard Solena's voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are heading north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was going back the way he came even though his Squad 3 was responsible for the west side.</p>
<p>Swiiiiiish- Swiiiiiiiish-</p>
<p>His ancient powers had been hidden thanks to Fredo's armband, but the Sound of the Wind now swirled at the tip of his feet.<br>
Although this power did not suit young master Naru-nim, no Vampires questioned this right now.</p>
<p>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The Vampires silently followed behind Cale.<br>
The slightly over 100 Vampires all headed north.<br>
Cale served as their guide in the front.</p>
<p>Shhhhh- shhhhhhh-</p>
<p>They brushed past branches and bushes and immediately turned north once they returned to the place they had teleported to.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak once they were following behind Squad 1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shhh.</p>
<p>One of the large trees started to shake.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Cale turned his head after hearing a loud noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, young master-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiger shaman Gashan welcomed him.</p>
<p>Crunch. Crunch.</p>
<p>The large Tiger warriors slowly raised their heads from the shadows of the trees along with the sound of crunching leaves.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Mm!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Solena had heard about this, but her hands still became sweaty after looking into the eyes of the Tiger warriors who had been hiding.</p>
<p>&rsquo;It's starting now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She tensed up after realizing that the true plan was starting.<br>
She was excited as well.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dark Elves&rsquo; Elementals have headed south with Squad 4.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elementals that Count Mock's subordinates controlled...<br>
Those Elementals were said to eat other Elementals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is our chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The golden top's whip was in Cale's hand.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Just tell me what to do. Chaos, destruction, happiness.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;It&rsquo;s been a while! I've been so bored ever since you told me to wait in the Forest of Darkness!&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Sigh. It was so hard hiding from the Dark Elves&rsquo; Elementals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Caw. Caw.</p>
<p>Cale lifted his head.</p>
<p>The three Wind Elementals and the crows started to appear one or two at a time and started to cover the sky above the Forest of Darkness.</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The operation name is &rsquo;Hunt.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>He ordered the first step of the operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will capture Squad 1 first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Squad 1's leader was swordsman Andrei who was said to be one of the strongest of the noble awaiters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vampires and Tigers started to move north.<br>
Their movements were swift but stealthy.</p>
<p>Squad 3 started to chase behind Squad 1.</p>
<hr>
<p>Squad 1's leader, swordsman Andrei.</p>
<p>"Squad leader-nim, it is to the left.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed the Vampire informant and turned left with a faint smile on his face.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Soon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was one of the top noble awaiters.</p>
<p>He was lacking in comparison to the original nobles, but he was skilled enough to be able to receive the best treatment if he had gone to any other organization.<br>
This was because he was a sword master.</p>
<p>Ooooooooong-</p>
<p>His sword started to vibrate.<br>
A faint aura smoke started to appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked back for a moment after hearing a voice right behind him.<br>
Another noble awaiter was smiling as he sucked up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrei looked stern as if to ask the person who spoke what they were talking about in the middle of the plan.<br>
The person who spoke smiled even brighter after seeing his expression.</p>
<p>"Aw come on, you know exactly what I mean, sir.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ahem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrei let out a fake cough and turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Please keep the useless chatter for later.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I'm only saying it because we are on our own now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrei peeked toward the Vampire informant after hearing that. It was his way of telling the other person that they were not &rsquo;on our own,&rsquo; with this Vampire here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other noble awaiter finally closed his mouth.<br>
However, he still smiled wickedly toward Andrei.</p>
<p>He was not the only one.<br>
Andrei's subordinates, as well as the 24 noble awaiters who made up his squad, all had bright expressions.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Hehe. It&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t understand why he feels that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Andrei understood the other awaiter quite well.</p>
<p>The Black Castle destruction plan.<br>
The plan was to destroy the castle while Cale Henituse and his core group of friends were not around and take the people inside as hostages.</p>
<p>&rsquo;It won't be easy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even without Cale Henituse and the core individuals, the chances that Cale Henituse left the castle empty because there were enough defenses set up were high.<br>
That was why he thought that the difficulty of the plan would be considered high between high, medium, and low.</p>
<p>&rsquo;But it is not so dangerous that I might die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was what was making the members of Squad 1 all have bright expressions.<br>
This was especially true for Andrei, who was full of anticipation.</p>
<p>If this plan was a success...</p>
<p>&rsquo;I should receive a noble title if we succeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was a squad leader after all.<br>
He had to temporarily become Count Mock's subordinate because of it, but he wasn&rsquo;t planning on quietly staying there.</p>
<p>Andrei composed his expression and started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody focus!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then gave an order to the informant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are increasing our speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was planning on quickly getting to the discussed location and surrounding the Black Castle.</p>
<p>Andrei's desires were almost overflowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I will increase my speed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The informant quickly moved with the map in his hand.<br>
Andrei followed behind him as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The informant's body suddenly fell forward at that moment.</p>
<p>"What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrei looked toward the informant in shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M, my foot-!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The informant reached for his ankle with a shocked expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrei&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>He saw a gold rope that shot out of the ground and grabbed the Vampire informant&rsquo;s ankle.</p>
<p>"A rope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Is this one of Cale Henituse's traps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His back suddenly turned cold as he had that thought.</p>
<p>&rsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He felt as if something was clenching him from all directions.<br>
That was why he realized it.</p>
<p>&rsquo;This is not just a simple trap!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned away from the Vampire who was still on the ground clenching his ankle.</p>
<p>He happened to see something land on his arm at that moment.<br>
Andrei had been quickly charging forward until now. That was why he had not noticed it earlier.</p>
<p>That thing had landed on the back of his hand silently and so gently that he didn't even feel it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Powder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gold powder was surrounding him and the rest of Squad 1.<br>
The amount of powder started to exponentially increase.</p>
<p>&rsquo;This is dangerous! I can tell that this is very dangerous!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Andrei shouted as soon as he felt that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Dodge! Step back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to move back as he shouted.</p>
<p>The gold powder.<br>
He couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was, but his intuition as someone who just barely made it past the hump to become a sword master was telling him that this was a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>But it was already too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ugh! My body!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ahhh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The powder instantly gathered together and increased in size.<br>
It then started to bind the bodies of Squad 1's members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N, no!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t move my body!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shining golden rope was too strong to be a regular rope.<br>
It was hard for them to even twist their bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! How is this so strong?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrei's body had been bound before he could even take out his sword.<br>
It was so quick that he couldn't even dodge.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Is it a trap?&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was not it.<br>
He quickly got rid of the thought that these ropes were traps that Cale had left behind.</p>
<p>&rsquo;This is someone attacking us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This power had accurately aimed for all of them.<br>
That was only possible if someone was looking at them right now.</p>
<p>There was also something else he realized.</p>
<p>&rsquo;This person is strong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was able to become the squad leader because he was a sword master, but most of Squad 1's members were quite strong as well.<br>
There were mages in the group too, but this enemy had tricked all of them and had instantly suppressed them.</p>
<p>Andrei started to sweat.<br>
He held back his fear and raised his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?! Who dares to ambush us like this?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked around and raised his voice.<br>
His hand was doing everything it could to get free and reach for his scabbard.</p>
<p>&rsquo;If I can just get my sword out!&rsquo; </p>
<p>He could just slash away this stupid rope with his aura if he could pull his sword out.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you looking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrei heard a foreign voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should raise your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flinch.</p>
<p>Andrei's shoulders flinched before he looked up.</p>
<p>He could see an Elf sitting on top of a thick branch on a tree.<br>
The beautiful Elf with white-gold hair started to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to return alive after stepping into a Dragon&rsquo;s lair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;What? A Dragon&rsquo;s lair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Andrei was definitely looking at an Elf, but his whole body felt chilly after looking into the Elf&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm. How disappointing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard a voice behind him.<br>
Andrei slowly raised his head.</p>
<p>It was a familiar voice.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Whose voice is this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He soon remembered the owner of this voice.<br>
He was confused because the way the person was speaking was completely different than normal, but he remembered.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...Young master Naru Von Ejellan!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were allies.</p>
<p>His head that had been slowly turning quickly turned in joy about seeing an ally before he could even question why Naru was here.<br>
Naru was smiling and approaching him.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak.<br>
He didn't sound like the pure and brave boy who just wanted to get revenge for his father. It was a cold voice that reached Andrei's ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very disappointing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naru was disappointed.<br>
The boy's gaze headed toward the white-gold haired Elf sitting on the tree branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you attack first like that, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;...What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Andrei's questioned his ears for a moment.<br>
However, that suspicion soon returned with a clear answer.</p>
<p>Naru looked at him and started to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was supposed to get him first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grrrrr-</p>
<p>Squad 1 quickly heard the roars of wild beasts surrounding them.</p>
<p>Crunch. Crunch.</p>
<p>However, the things that came out through the bushes were the Beast men of the Tiger tribe who were much scarier than wild beasts.<br>
Berserk Tigers completely surrounded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrei looked back and Naru and started to shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master Naru! What the hell are you doing? Did you betray us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Naru did not respond.<br>
Someone else responded in his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betray? How can you say such upsetting things?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Who are you?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the Vampire knights who had been standing behind Cale walked forward.<br>
The Vampires bowed their heads and made a path for him.</p>
<p>The knight removed the helmet on his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know my face, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhh, uhh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrei could not continue speaking because he was shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H, how are you here?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo was smiling after seeing his reaction.</p> <a href="./chapter546.html" class="chapter-nav">
