<p>&ldquo;October 25th, 11am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale quietly watched Lee Seung Won who was peeking at him while speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won hesitated before responding to Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyung, will this really be useful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked up after seeing the uncertainty in Lee Seung Won&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>He could see the clear sky.</p>
<p>He was currently on the roof of the central shelter building.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Cale-nim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale recalled the conversation he had with Choi Han last night.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What is it?&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;The God of Death said this in passing... But either way, this is what he said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han had wondered if it was important, but he still said it as if it was nothing.</p>
<p>&rsquo;The sealed god is not able to return to the past, but he is able to push his way into a different dimension.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han then shrugged his shoulders, saying that was it.</p>
<p>Cale, who had been extremely busy since last night, was finally able to think about it now that he had some time.</p>
<p>&rsquo;He's able to open a path into a different dimension?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Did that mean that this place was not a test created with his past as the background?</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Could this be a different place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or was it just an illusion created for his test?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rok Soo hyung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale turned his gaze.</p>
<p>"Can I ask you what you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale shrugged his shoulders at Choi Han's question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm? Oh, nothing much. I was just thinking about the dimension thing you mentioned last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han instantly understood what Cale was thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you thinking that a different dimension-&rdquo;</p>
<p>He peeked at Lee Seung Won for a moment before shutting up.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won was looking at Choi Han with interest.</p>
<p>&rsquo;He said that he was Rok Soo hyung&rsquo;s close dongsaeng?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were said to be like blood siblings.</p>
<p>&rsquo;He&rsquo;s the same age as me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were the same age, but Lee Seung Won found it difficult to speak to Choi Han for some reason.</p>
<p>Choi Han also stayed next to Rok Soo hyung and did not try to chat with the others.</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head at Choi Han who had stopped speaking after peeking at Lee Seung Won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I'm just thinking about that statement.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;But I came into your consci-, mm, anyway, that was the condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Choi Han had come into Cale's consciousness, he didn't think it was a different dimension or anything like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cale didn&rsquo;t trust either the God of Death nor the sealed god.</p>
<p>Gods. He had never seen them lie, but he had seen them not tell the entire truth many times.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Either way, whether this world is an illusion or a test or whatever...&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was going to treat it as if it was real.</p>
<p>Cale had already made up his mind.</p>
<p>He looked toward Lee Seung Won and started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked if this will be useful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the question Lee Seung Won had asked Cale just now.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Hyung, will this really be useful?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won cautiously nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Yes. Do you think it&rsquo;ll be useful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head at the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more that this world was real to Kim Rok Soo and Cale Henituse...</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won&rsquo;s ability was necessary.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter whether this world was an illusion or a test.</p>
<p>He needed to create a future for them.</p>
<p>He needed to give them hope.</p>
<p>Wouldn't that be the best way to get rid of his despair?</p>
<p>If getting rid of Cale&rsquo;s, or actually, Kim Rok Soo's despair was the conditions for passing this test...</p>
<p>That made it more important for Cale to create a future for them.</p>
<p>That way he could... Wash away the despair he had for not just this one moment, but the future that would come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his hand on the shoulder of Lee Seung Won, the boy who was only three years younger than him in this place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Data is the future. Even weak humans are able to defeat a monster if they know its weakness. Being able to think. That is the greatest strength humans have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won&rsquo;s ability.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Recording.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked at the small badge in Lee Seung Won&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>It was a random badge that had been rolling around inside the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seung Won. The information you create with your abilities will become the hope for this world.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...To survive-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that it&rsquo;s a useless power for survival?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won nodded his head and quietly responded to Cale who cut him off and asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Yeah.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale disagreed with Lee Seung Won without any hesitation.</p>
<p>There were no abilities that were useless for survival.</p>
<p>They needed every ability.</p>
<p>However, it was just the difference of whether it was needed now or for the future.</p>
<p>Cale looked down from the roof.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won also looked down at the ground as well.</p>
<p>They were looking at the area inside the boundaries where monsters did not come.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won took in all of it.</p>
<p>More people than ever were standing inside the boundaries.</p>
<p>He could feel the rowdiness inside the building right now.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won heard Cale&rsquo;s whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seung Won. Take a good look at today's battles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That whisper was very confident as if he was telling the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll see how even people without abilities can fight and win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won looked back toward Cale.</p>
<p>Cale was standing up at that moment.</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Park Jin Tae who had opened the door to the roof and was walking in.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae was with Lee Chul Min as they walked over to Cale.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I delivered your message to the other central shelters. We went to more temporary shelters as well.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they call you crazy?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Pfft.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Park Jin Tae chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they did. Who wouldn&rsquo;t? We were telling them that all of the shelters would be destroyed and that monsters will come charging in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From last night until this morning...</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae and a few others had urgently gathered teams to go visit the two central shelters close to this one.</p>
<p>They also stopped by the temporary shelters they knew of along the way as well.</p>
<p>They had informed all of those shelters about the things Kim Rok Soo had told Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>They also handed them the things Kim Rok Soo told them to deliver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also brought the people who believed us back, just as you wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One corner of Cale's lips went up after hearing Park Jin Tae&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it just because I wanted it? Didn&rsquo;t you bring them because you wanted to save them? Isn&rsquo;t that why you kept doing it all morning even though it was supposed to end at dawn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae had been busy since last night and all morning today bringing people over from many places.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae avoided Cale's smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Don't speak such nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smirk.</p>
<p>Cale smiled once more and Park Jin Tae started to frown as he started to speak again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I handed out all of our food except for one day's worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae did not give out all of the food they had gathered during the hunts.</p>
<p>They always put aside a portion of the food with long expiration dates.</p>
<p>They did it for the days that they couldn't hunt.</p>
<p>But he had given out a majority of their reserves today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody must have eaten until they were full.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s the only way for them to be able to deal with your plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae took a step toward Cale. He then started to speak in a concerned tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will starve in one day if you lied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale's calm eyes looked toward Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not believe me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked past Cale and at Choi Han.</p>
<p>He then looked at Lee Seung Won as well.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae then started to speak again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...I haven't seen any monsters nearby since last night. It&rsquo;s quiet even when we are out past the boundary. It looks as if the monsters are hiding from the humans.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the calm before the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have foresight, but I do have my intuition. It seemed as if there would be a storm soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min had a stiff expression while standing behind Park Jin Tae as well.</p>
<p>He seemed to have felt the eerie fear surrounding them as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandma Kim told me to give you a message. She said that the things you asked for are all prepared.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Then I guess I should go down now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale headed toward the door.</p>
<p>He then headed down.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae and Choi Han were right behind him.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won watched them for a moment before starting to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The current time is 11:45 am on October 25th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice sounded slightly anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All central shelters will be destroyed at 12:01 pm. The temporary shelters will slowly be destroyed as well. The monsters will continuously attack for 24 hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won closed his eyes for a moment before opening them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won's voice started to sound more energetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new central shelter will soon appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was being recorded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We plan on heading there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won hesitated before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kim Rok Soo has prophesized all of this and I, Lee Seung Won, believe everything he said. We will now start the first record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won clenched the badge and headed down from the roof.</p>
<p>It was so that he could follow behind Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Hmm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked around as he headed to the bottom of the building.</p>
<p>He could feel the whispers and anxious gazes being focused on him.</p>
<p>It was not very loud inside the building because everybody was speaking quietly.</p>
<p>That made people even more anxious.</p>
<p>But Cale's eyes were looking at something else instead of that anxiety.</p>
<p>&rsquo;We did as much as we could.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was only one day, but there were many things prepared throughout the building that Cale had asked for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Rok Soo.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Grandma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandma Kim was in charge of everything inside the building while Park Jin Tae was going to the nearby shelters last night.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae told people that he was leaving everything to her, so everything was able to quickly proceed as Grandma Kim had a good reputation with everyone.</p>
<p>Cale headed for the main door on the first floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jang Man Soo who was sitting on a chair near the door waved at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here. Take this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the item Jang Man Soo handed him.</p>
<p>It was a watch.</p>
<p>It was one of the few devices that still worked.</p>
<p>Tick tock.</p>
<p>Time was flowing by.</p>
<p>A lot of time had passed as he slowly came down while looking around.</p>
<p>The current time was 11:55 am.</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choi Han, move the mister.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, hyung-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jang Man Soo got on Choi Han&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Cale headed out the door.</p>
<p>In the open area outside the building... There were many ability users gathered in this area inside the boundaries of the central shelter.</p>
<p>They were looking at Cale with anxiety, distrust, confusion, and all sorts of other emotions.</p>
<p>Cale walked past them toward the edge of the boundary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won's older sister, Lee Jin Joo, awkwardly smiled and greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this my spot?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir. Choi Han, put the mister down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jang Man Soo was now next to Cale. He had been lowered right in front of the boundary.</p>
<p>He felt the soft blanket under him as he looked up at Cale.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...I didn't know he had this side to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was looking at Kim Rok Soo, who was standing up straight despite the anxious, fearful, distrusting, and angry gazes focused on him, in amazement.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's 1 minute left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae quickly raised his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody, get to your stations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>People quickly moved to their stations at Park Jin Tae's order.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae could see some distrusting gazes as he watched them move.</p>
<p>&rsquo;You trust what Kim Rok Soo said?&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;What the hell are we doing so early in the day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was what their gazes were saying.</p>
<p>Those were the grumbles and questions directed toward Park Jin Tae, the leader of this central shelter, who had been moving around because of Kim Rok Soo since last night.</p>
<p>&rsquo;This is driving me nuts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae was actually feeling the same way.</p>
<p>He wondered if they really should be doing this.</p>
<p>However, he decided to wait as well since he said he would trust Rok Soo.</p>
<p>Soon.</p>
<p>The moment Kim Rok Soo described would be here soon.</p>
<p>They heard Kim Rok Soo&rsquo;s nonchalant voice at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was still bright and the sky was clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody inside the central shelter looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>Their hearts were beating wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that moment...</p>
<p>The world turned dark.</p>
<p>Everybody felt as if they were losing strength in their arms and legs.</p>
<p>Their bodies felt as if they were going cold.</p>
<p>It was because they could imagine the terrible nightmare that was to start.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Kim Rok Soo was right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>From inside the darkness...</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae started to frown in this world where he could not see anything.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noona!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could hear Kim Rok Soo's voice through the darkness.</p>
<p>He was calling for Lee Jin Joo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noona! Speak as loudly as you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale put his hand on Lee Jin Joo's shoulder as she was curled up in fear from the darkness.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because of his body heat...</p>
<p>Lee Jin Joo started to speak.</p>
<p>{This is a message from the Park Jin Tae shelter.}</p>
<p>She had supposedly majored in Music.</p>
<p>Maybe that was the reason.</p>
<p>{Last night, or maybe early today. You should have received information from the Park Jin Tae shelter.}</p>
<p>Her voice echoed through the dark world.</p>
<p>Her ability was &rsquo;amplification.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was loud enough to reach the nearby shelters and the other two central shelters.</p>
<p>Normally, she would not use her ability as it would draw monsters to them, but it was different if the monsters were going to come anyway.</p>
<p>{Please use that information to persist.}</p>
<p>To the people in the other shelters who had not believed Cale&rsquo;s words that Park Jin Tae had delivered to them...</p>
<p>Her voice would be like a lighthouse.</p>
<p>{As mentioned in the information we delivered, a new central shelter will appear.}</p>
<p>The new central shelters would be the size of 3 - 5 current central shelters combined.</p>
<p>&rsquo;But that means that 3 - 5 of the original central shelters will disappear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>3 - 5 of the original central shelters would disappear and a large central shelter would take their place.</p>
<p>She continued to speak.</p>
<p>{You will hear my voice once every hour.}</p>
<p>It was about time for that voice to stop talking for a moment.</p>
<p>{I hope to see you all at the new central shelter. Let's all survive together.}</p>
<p>Cale who was listening to the ticking of the watch that still had batteries started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;10 seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;9, 8, .... 5, 4.&rsquo;</p>
<p>{Good luck.}</p>
<p>As Lee Jin Joo's first amplification came to an end...</p>
<p>&rsquo;3, 2.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1 second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The world brightened up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae subconsciously took a step back.</p>
<p>He had the chills.</p>
<p>Intense pressure was bearing down on him from all sides.</p>
<p>He felt as if he was going to be suffocated to death from the pressure.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae stopped walking back after looking out in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...F*ck......&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not see the end.</p>
<p>There were so many Grade 3 monsters that Kim Rok Soo mentioned moving toward them that he couldn't see the end.</p>
<p>The Grade 2 and Grade 1 monsters would be waiting their turn behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...My goodness! I, it really-!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae could hear Lee Chul Min's astonished voice.</p>
<p>Everybody couldn&rsquo;t help but feel fear and despair at the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>They had prayed that it wouldn&rsquo;t happen, but this nightmare, no, this real situation, was suffocating them.</p>
<p>They heard a sharp voice at that moment.</p>
<p>"Everybody snap out of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody turned toward Cale who was standing right in front of the boundary.</p>
<p>They were all looking at his back.</p>
<p>Cale had not even turned around.</p>
<p>But he needed to do something about the people who were afraid of the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>He needed to tell them they didn&rsquo;t need to be afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choi Han!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale and Choi Han made eye contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweep them away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han started to run toward the Grade 3 monsters charging toward them.</p> <a href="./chapter560.html" class="chapter-nav">
