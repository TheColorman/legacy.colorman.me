<p>&ldquo;Get them!&rdquo;<br>"We must save the Chief Priest-nim! Shoot the arrows!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Call for reinforcements!&rdquo;</p><p>There were people chasing the escaping Ron, Glenn, On, and Hong.</p><p>They were the priests serving the Demonic race as well as others.</p><p>&ldquo;Put dead mana on the arrows and fire!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go on top of the buildings! Pour dead mana on those bastards&rsquo; heads!&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;...Shit.&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu realized why Ron had sent such an urgent request.</p><p>The enemies were trying to attack using dead mana from who knows where.</p><p>Dead mana was extremely deadly for anyone except people like black mages, necromancers, and Dark Elves with the darkness attribute.</p><p>&rsquo;It makes sense that he is escaping.&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu quickly lowered the altitude and headed toward Ron.</p><p>He made eye contact with Ron at that moment.</p><p>Flick.</p><p>Ron leisurely greeted him even in such a situation.</p><p>&rsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s him being respectful or just casual.&rsquo;</p><p>Either way, this guy was definitely not normal.</p><p>&ldquo;Meeeeeeeeeeow!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Meeeeeow!&rdquo;</p><p>The Cat children greeting him weren't normal either.</p><p>&ldquo;Huff! Huff! Please save us!&rdquo;</p><p>Glenn, who was shouting with a desperate look on his face, was showing a normal reaction. This reaction was fitting for Mercenary King Bud's close friend.</p><p>&ldquo;I will take Ron Molan and the children.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu took out the Unbreakable Spear after hearing Beacrox's short response.</p><p>It was still in the shape of the beautiful white gun.</p><p>Tang! Tang!</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! That weapon--!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exploding! Dodge!&rdquo;</p><p>They did not have enough fighting force unlike when they were in Section 1 because there were so many priests.</p><p>Alberu used the opening created from the enemies becoming confused and quickly got closer to Ron.</p><p>&ldquo;Get on.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron dragged Gersey as he got on the skeleton wyvern&rsquo;s back.</p><p>Alberu reached out one hand.</p><p>Tap. Tap.</p><p>On and Hong quickly climbed up his hand and arm and jumped onto his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Huff. Huff! Me too-&rdquo;</p><p>As for Glenn...</p><p>&ldquo;Ahhh!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Please be quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>Beacrox grabbed him by the back of his clothes and safely dropped him on the back of the skeleton wyvern.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu looked toward Mary&rsquo;s skeleton monsters blocking the White Star and quickly started to move.</p><p>&ldquo;It looks like they realized that we have abducted the Chief Priest.&rdquo;</p><p>He saw that the White Star was looking at him with an extremely angry gaze and increased his speed.</p><p>Baaaaang! Bang, crackle!</p><p>&ldquo;You rat-like bastards-!&rdquo;</p><p>Multiple skeleton monsters started to crumble with a single slash from the White Star's sword.</p><p>But there were too many skeleton monsters.</p><p>Rumble, ruuuuuuuuumble-</p><p>The sky started to roar.</p><p>Alberu could see that the White Star&rsquo;s sky-attribute ancient power was making the sky roar.</p><p>&ldquo;Even if you use the sky power now... Pffft.&rdquo;</p><p>He just ignored it.</p><p>It could not be helped.</p><p>The moment they got out of the sinkhole...</p><p>&ldquo;Hurry up and get on the airship!&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu saw a large airship appear as he heard Eruhaben's shout.</p><p>It was the airship they had hidden in the forest nearby.</p><p>In the past...</p><p>Within the southern area of the Western continent... This airship that once belonged to the Mogoru Empire had tried to attack the Jungle's capital.</p><p>It had ended up in Rosalyn and Eruhaben&rsquo;s hands and the airship that had played a big role in the Mogoru Empire had reappeared today.</p><p>Of course, this airship was much more advanced than the one led by Bear King Sayeru that Cale had destroyed.</p><p>&ldquo;...She said that she was going to station this next to the Magic Tower-&rdquo;</p><p>He recalled something Rosalyn had said in the past before stepping onto the airship.</p><p>His allies...</p><p>The black orb with Cale inside...</p><p>The Wolf children...</p><p>Even Deputy Chief Priest Cotton and the others who had snuck out from the God of War&rsquo;s resting place while they were rescuing Cale...</p><p>Everybody got on.</p><p>Alberu and the others beside the Mercenary King and Glenn who had already been in the Eastern continent had come here on this airship.</p><p>Of course, they had used teleportation magic.</p><p>Glenn shouted in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;A, a teleportation magic circle to transport this large airship whole-?!&rdquo;</p><p>This highest-grade mage could not hide his shock.</p><p>Ooooooong-</p><p>This airship that was currently reacting to the mana and shaking was a large moving vehicle.</p><p>As for the captain of this vehicle...</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Glenn, please help me.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Rosalyn.</p><p>&ldquo;Y, yes, of course!&rdquo;</p><p>Glenn quickly headed to the center of the magic circle.</p><p>Raon and Rosalyn's mana were twisted together and glowing dark red.</p><p>Glenn supported them with his mana from the side.</p><p>All three of their magic levels were highest-grade, making them able to do something like this without practicing in advance.</p><p>&rsquo;My goodness.&rsquo;</p><p>But Glenn was shocked at this situation.</p><p>&rsquo;How much money did they spend?&rsquo;</p><p>He had never seen this airship before because he had been on the Eastern continent.</p><p>That was why he could only gulp after seeing that the entire ship had highest-grade magic stones every so often and was made of expensive materials.</p><p>&rsquo;...Most importantly-&rsquo;</p><p>Something else had shocked him.</p><p>&rsquo;A couple hundred people can fit on this.&rsquo;</p><p>This large teleportation magic circle that could transport hundreds of people at once...</p><p>This many people was pretty much an army.</p><p>And since the person controlling this teleportation magic circle was Rosalyn...</p><p>&rsquo;If she fills this airship with mages in the future-?!&rsquo;</p><p>That would be the birth of an unbelievable mage brigade.</p><p>She was the future master of the to-be-created Magic Tower after all. She will have troops equivalent to the troops of a kingdom even though she would not be a Queen.</p><p>&rsquo;...I'm glad she&rsquo;s on our side.&rsquo;</p><p>Glenn truly felt that way as he channeled his mana.</p><p>Rosalyn opened her eyes at that moment.</p><p>The sun was all the way out in the sky and the wind fluttered her hair.</p><p>That wind was caused by their casting of this large spell.</p><p>She was the one who had caused it.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>As the largest highest-grade magic stone at the center of the magic circle cracked and then exploded...</p><p>&ldquo;First destination. We are moving to the Mercenaries Guild.&rdquo;</p><p>She gave a short explanation before the airship started to teleport.</p><p>&ldquo;You bastards-!&rdquo;</p><p>They could see the White Star, who seemed to have made it past the skeleton monsters, in the distance.</p><p>Ancient Dragon Eruhaben, who was not within the teleportation magic circle, let out a short sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;My goodness, he&rsquo;s so persistent.&rdquo;</p><p>He then launched tens of gold arrows toward the White Star.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so annoying.&rdquo;</p><p>As his attack made the White Star hesitate...</p><p>On and Hong who were in Alberu&rsquo;s arms peeked their faces over Alberu&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bye nya!&rdquo;</p><p>They then waved their paws to say goodbye to the White Star.</p><p>&ldquo;See you next time.&rdquo;</p><p>Eruhaben gave the final goodbye as they all disappeared.</p><p>Now that they were gone...</p><p>It looked as if the airship had never been in the Endable Kingdom in the first place.</p><hr><p>As for where it appeared...</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve arrived at our first destination.&rdquo;</p><p>They were inside a forest.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the right place?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the exact location!&rdquo;</p><p>Bud smiled brightly and nodded his head after hearing Rosalyn&rsquo;s question.</p><p>&ldquo;The Mercenaries Guild's shelter is around here, so we can get off now.&rdquo;</p><p>Bud and Glenn.</p><p>The Mercenaries Guild's leader and his close friend who was just as strong had attacked the White Star today.</p><p>That was why the chief executives of the Mercenaries Guild all around the Eastern continent would go and hide in their respective shelters starting today.</p><p>&ldquo;Please take care of me.&rdquo;</p><p>Deputy Chief Priest Cotton. Cotton, the priestess of the God of War, was planning on staying here with Bud.</p><p>&ldquo;No worries. Our Mercenaries Guild members were able to survive thanks to you, Deputy Chief Priest-nim.&rdquo;</p><p>There had been some Mercenaries Guild members who not been able to make it out of the Endable Kingdom and had stayed in the God of War&rsquo;s resting place with Eruhaben.</p><p>Cotton waved her hand as if it was nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;I just did what was expected of me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t expected of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Bud smiled like a reliable leader as he shook Cotton's hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye Mercenary King!&rdquo;</p><p>Bud then responded to Raon's goodbye with a mischievous smile before being the last to get off the airship.</p><p>"We are now moving to our second destination.&rdquo;</p><p>Their second destination was also their final destination.</p><p>Alberu closed his eyes as he heard Rosalyn&rsquo;s statement.</p><p>He could feel his body slowly starting to teleport.</p><hr><p>Paaaaat-!</p><p>Alberu opened his eyes after feeling a bright light.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Sheritt.</p><p>She was out here to greet the airship.</p><p>Screech- screech-</p><p>They were in one of the Forbidden Regions on the Western continent.</p><p>They were in the Forest of Darkness within the Henituse territory.</p><p>Flying monsters screeched and shot up into the air as if they were scared by the sudden appearance of the airship.</p><p>Grrrrrr!</p><p>Kaaaaaaaa, kaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p><p>They could also hear the cries of mutant monsters that were difficult to find anywhere else in the Western continent if they carefully listened.</p><p>At the center of that forest...</p><p>A black castle was profoundly giving off its black glimmer even while under the radiant sun.</p><p>They were met by Lord Sheritt, whose attribute was defense.</p><p>The corners of Alberu&rsquo;s lips went up.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew I liked this place.&rdquo;</p><p>If they were to look for a place where Cale Henituse would be the safest and a place that would be ideal to fight against their enemies...</p><p>There was no better place than this.</p><p>He alighted from the airship and looked around.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm!&rdquo;</p><p>He then flinched.</p><p>&ldquo;Goldie gramps! I'm going to be first!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whatever then, little kid. I'm after you.&rdquo;</p><p>Raon and Eruhaben.</p><p>&ldquo;I'll do it too. I created a new magic circle and it was quite effective.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I'll go last then.&rdquo;</p><p>Rosalyn. And then Lord Sheritt.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm. Then we can add the power of incantation as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Even Gashan.</p><p>They were all looking at Cale who was inside the half-transparent black orb.</p><p>The five of them surrounded the black orb and started to cast all sorts of spells and incantations as soon as that orb was lowered down to the black castle.</p><p>&ldquo;...Oh my.&rdquo;</p><p>They were all strong spells and most of them were for protecting the orb.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm going to cast an attack spell as well! I won&rsquo;t leave them alone if they try to harm our human!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I already did that.&rdquo;</p><p>They added all sorts of attack spells as well.</p><p>&ldquo;...Mm.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu started to think.</p><p>&ldquo;...I guess I don't need to worry about Cale Henituse's safety.&rdquo;</p><p>He said that while sighing before turning away from the three Dragons, one mage, and one shaman.</p><p>&ldquo;......!&rdquo;</p><p>He was then shocked.</p><p>Clang. Clang.</p><p>Beacrox was grinding his sword.</p><p>Next to him were numerous daggers that had already been restored to the point that they were shining.</p><p>Beacrox was just grinding his swords while looking at the unconscious Chief Priest Gersey.</p><p>&rsquo;Mm.&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu held back his sigh after seeing that.</p><p>He pretended not to see the three layers of black gloves that were on Beacrox&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Your highness, you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu got the chills after seeing Ron&rsquo;s gentle smile and quickly turned toward On and Hong.</p><p>&ldquo;Please create some fog around the castle and the forest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I understand! That&rsquo;s easy, nya!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I'm going to put out a weak poison too, nya!&rdquo;</p><p>On and Hong nodded their heads with happy expressions on their faces.</p><p>Alberu started to smile because they looked so cute.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;</p><p>However, his expression soon stiffened up.</p><p>&ldquo;Then we'll be back soon, nya!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back soon, nya!&rdquo;</p><p>Before On and Hong said goodbye to the adults nearby and headed toward the forest that was pretty much their front yard now...</p><p>They picked up one of their paws and...</p><p>Slap!</p><p>Slap!</p><p>Each slapped one of the unconscious Gersey&rsquo;s cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Oo...ooooooooo. Grooooooan......&rdquo;</p><p>Gersey groaned, but On and Hong had already left toward the forest with feather-like movements.</p><p>&rsquo;...I've felt this before, but...&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu had a thought after watching all of this.</p><p>&rsquo;Cale Henituse has picked some peculiar people to be his friends.&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu was thinking that he did not fall under the same category.</p><p>That was why he checked that everybody was busy before starting to speak to Ron in a quiet voice.</p><p>"Ron Molan. Why were you running away?&rdquo;</p><p>Ron turned toward Alberu.</p><p>Screeeech.</p><p>He could see Alberu&rsquo;s blonde hair and blue eyes once he removed his helmet.</p><p>He could see that those eyes were sparkling with an odd gaze.</p><p>"What did you see?&rdquo;</p><p>He could hear Alberu calmly asking in a cold voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you can tell me right away.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked as radiant as the sun above him.</p><p>Ron started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw them transforming dead mana. That seemed to be the nutrients being injected into the sculptures that Raon-nim mentioned.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Transforming dead mana?&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu's eyes clouded over.</p><hr><p>Cale could hear the Super Rock's voice.</p><ul><li>Cale, isn&rsquo;t it a bit better now?</li></ul><p>&rsquo;It is. I feel much better.&rsquo;</p><p>About half of the pain in his body had disappeared.</p><p>&rsquo;Did they rescue me on the other side?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale realized that Alberu and the others must have done something and tried to stand up with a bright expression on his face.</p><p>He made an attempt.</p><p>However, there was someone who gently pushed down on his shoulders and made it so that he could not stand up.</p><p>&ldquo;Commander, you will lie down. That will be the reward for my faith.&rdquo;</p><p>Joo Ho-Shik, whose clothes were quite raggedy from doing who knows what, was looking down at Cale with his eyes opened wide and a vicious expression on his face.</p><p>His eyes were open so wide that...</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s a bit scary.&rsquo;</p><p>As Cale had that thought...</p><p>&ldquo;Please lay still. Do you understand?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait-&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have faith that you will do that, Commander-nim.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale closed his mouth and looked around after hearing Joo Ho-Shik's calm but oddly vicious tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Rok Soo.&rdquo;</p><p>But what he saw was...</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be inside the shelter soon. Just lie there. Got it? Okay, Rok Soo?&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk with a stoic expression that seemed even more vicious than Joo Ho-Shik and a silent Choi Han. He also saw the stiff expressions on the faces of the others.</p><p>"The Commander-nim is here!&rdquo;</p><p>Someone shouted at that moment.</p><p>Screeeech-!</p><p>The gate to the shelter opened.</p><p>Cale slowly turned away after seeing many pairs of eyes staring at him.</p><p>He then started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;...Where did you all get a movable bed like this?&rdquo;</p><p>Nobody responded to him.</p><p>Clunk. Clunk.</p><p>Choi Han just quietly pushed the head of the movable bed as Cale lied on it.</p><p>The moment when the yellow head ran away...</p><p>During that short lull in the battle...</p><p>&rsquo;Move!&rsquo;</p><p>Joo Ho-Shik had shouted loudly as if he was screaming before jumping over the castle wall and running toward Cale with the movable bed.</p><p>He had then said the following.</p><p>&rsquo;Let&rsquo;s lay him down.&rsquo;</p><p>It was the moment when Cale had realized that he could use &rsquo;Embrace&rsquo; to seal the sealed god with the stronger seal and was happy that he had found a way to smack the sealed god from the back.</p><p>Unfortunately, Cale could only quietly lie on the bed after Joo Ho-Shik&rsquo;s appearance.</p><p>He was being moved into the shelter while lying on the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm okay. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to use this for someone who is in a worse condition?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale quietly mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Commander-nim! Please don&rsquo;t shake my faith. Please?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rok Soo.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hey! You, you really!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Rok Soo hyung! Please!&rdquo;</p><p>He heard multiple people's voices.</p><p>Finally, once he heard even Choi Han say, &rsquo;Please!&rsquo;</p><ul><li><p>Cale. I think it is better to just be quiet.</p></li><li><p>Seems that way. Let&rsquo;s just go like this.</p></li></ul><p>Cale agreed with the Super Rock and the Kim Rok Soo of this world before quietly closing his eyes and letting the bed support his body.</p><p>He was carried into the shelter with everybody's eyes focused on him.</p> <a href="./chapter614.html" class="chapter-nav">
