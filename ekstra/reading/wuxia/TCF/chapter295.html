<p>Teaser: WTF?</p><p>&ldquo;I will give it my best.&rdquo;</p><p>Commander Cale responded to Imperial Prince Adin before turning around.<br>The nobles could see the dark blue hellfire that covered Cale&rsquo;s reddish brown eyes. Some of the nobles exchanged glances with one another.</p><p>&rsquo;Do you think he can do it? Especially when his face is so pale?&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;I don't know. He looks even skinnier than when he received the medal of honor too.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale looked paler and skinner than when he had received the Mogoru medal of honor last year.<br>Adin thought to himself as he observed Cale.</p><p>&rsquo;Looks like he is reaching his limit.&rsquo;</p><p>A death from the clashing of ancient powers. Adin could feel Cale reaching his end.</p><p>&rsquo;How entertaining.&rsquo;</p><p>He found it to be entertaining.<br>&rsquo;He doesn't seem like an idiot and seems to know what he is doing. So why does he always try to do the just and good deeds?&rsquo;</p><p>Adin approached Cale and asked with a concerned look on his face as he found all this to be entertaining.</p><p>&ldquo;How much of the water power can you use? I&rsquo;m sorry for asking for this but please use as much as you can!&rdquo;</p><p>He wanted to quickly see how Cale would look as he died.<br>Cale turned away from the dark blue flame and made eye contact with Adin, not knowing what Adin was thinking about.</p><p>&ldquo;...To be honest with you, I faced that fire once when I was fighting with the Breck Kingdom.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know. We ... Believe that it is the work of the Breck Kingdom as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale put on a concerned expression.</p><p>&ldquo;...This fire is even stronger than that fire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;<br>Some of the people around them let out gasps.</p><p>&ldquo;Cast water spells!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Use wind spells as well! Prevent the fire from spreading!&rdquo;</p><p>The Empire's mages quickly started to move.<br>They stopped the wind as much as possible, but the fire could not be stopped with water spells.</p><p>&ldquo;The fire is getting bigger!&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, the clashing of the Empire's wind with the Whipper Kingdom&rsquo;s wind fueled the flame even more to the point it looked like a fire tornado.<br>Cale put on a distressed expression on his face as that happened. The people around him knew what that expression meant.</p><p>&rsquo;He can&rsquo;t put it out completely!&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;...What do we do if you can't put it all out?&rsquo;</p><p>Magic did not work against this fire.<br>The chaos in their minds continued to grow. However, what they didn't see was that Cale's eyes were slowly moving although he had that distressed expression on his face.</p><p>&rsquo;...Some of the nobles don't seem to know about it.&rsquo;</p><p>Magic-resistant fire. Some of them did not seem to know that the Empire had that same type of fire.<br>Of course, the Alchemists&rsquo; Bell Tower was the one to make it, however, the Imperial Prince had already used it at the Jungle and at the first battle for Maple Castle.</p><p>&rsquo;It's the Vice Tower Master.&rsquo;</p><p>That was why Cale&rsquo;s gaze headed over to Vice Tower Master Metelona. She probably met frequently with the Alchemists&rsquo; Bell Tower's Tower Master.</p><p>&rsquo;...Who is that next to her?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale's gaze headed toward the man next to the Imperial Prince. The man slightly bowed and greeted Cale once their eyes met.<br>&ldquo;Nice to meet you. It is an honor to meet a hero. My name is Honte and I am the Tower Master-nim&rsquo;s disciple.</p><p>&rsquo;Ah, that person.<br>The miracle alchemist from the slums.<br>Probably one of the few people from the slums who survived.</p><p>This is great.&rsquo;</p><p>He found another person to drag into the Alchemists&rsquo; Bell Tower destruction project.<br>Cale slightly nodded his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us save the greetings for later. Right now-&rdquo;</p><p>The hero spoke with a stiff expression.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to put this fire out first.&rdquo;</p><p>It was at that moment.<br>He suddenly heard Raon's voice.</p><ul><li>Something is weird. Human, Honte seems to be dead.</li></ul><p>&rsquo;...Hmm?&rsquo;<br>Raon's comment came in like a hook.</p><ul><li>How does a dead thing move around?</li></ul><p>&rsquo;What did you say?&rsquo;<br>Cale&rsquo;s pupils shook for a moment.</p><ul><li>...Human, this is weird. He smells similar to Mary but there's no life coming from his body.</li></ul><p>&rsquo;There&rsquo;s no what?&rsquo;</p><ul><li>I don't know what that is.</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Oh my goodness.&rsquo;<br>Cale was completely anxious.</p><p>&rsquo;There&rsquo;s no life? He's dead?&rsquo;<br>Cale turned toward the Imperial Prince. He could naturally see the Vice Tower Master and Honte there as well. Honte was looking toward Cale and smiling.<br>He also seemed to be concerned about the Empire and the fire.</p><p>&rsquo;How can that be dead?</p><p>Is he a zombie?<br>What is going on?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale observed how Honte's gaze was focused on Hilsman and himself. The Imperial Prince approached him at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;...No need to put so much pressure on yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your highness-&rdquo;</p><p>Adin could see Cale's eyes shaking and his face turning paler, making him realize how much Cale wanted to save the Empire.</p><p>&rsquo;Is he going to become enemies with Rosalyn?&rsquo;</p><p>There was something else he was suspicious about as well but there was something more important.</p><p>&ldquo;I trust you.&rdquo;</p><p>Having the trust of the only Imperial Prince on the Western continent.<br>The weight of that trust was heavy. The nobles could see Cale&rsquo;s eyes starting to calm down. They were starting to feel pride for their Empire after seeing Cale calm down from hearing the Imperial Prince&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&rsquo;Trust me my ass.&rsquo;</p><p>However, contrary to what the nobles were thinking, Cale had calmed down after seeing how fake the Imperial Prince was being.</p><p>&ldquo;Huuuuuu.&rdquo;</p><p>He let out a deep breath and headed toward the center of the dirt wall.<br>He quietly walked over to the ledge of the dirt wall as the Empire&rsquo;s forces, the nobles, and everyone else around were looking at him.</p><p>Vice Captain Hilsman followed behind him with a sad expression on his face.<br>He gave off the vibe of a knight who was following behind his liege who had decided to sacrifice himself.</p><ul><li>Human, you said you'll control yourself! You promised me! I&rsquo;ll destroy everything if you don't!</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Ah, I really can&rsquo;t set the mood with him yapping like this.&rsquo;<br>Cale sighed at the mumblings of the six-year-old as he brushed the side of his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;...He seems to be afraid.&rdquo;</p><p>The nobles misinterpreted why Cale was acting like that.</p><p>&ldquo;Commander!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale turned his head after hearing a familiar voice.<br>The Caro Kingdom's crown prince Valentino. He appeared on the dirt wall again. He had a sad expression on his face.</p><p>&rsquo;...I can&rsquo;t understand how Commander Cale must feel right now.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale was controlling everything on this battlefield but still cutting away at his own life. Valentino felt as if Cale was extremely tall as he felt the weight on Cale&rsquo;s shoulders.<br>However, Valentino could see Cale reaching his hand out toward the large flame with a smile on his face.</p><p>Swooooooooooooosh-</p><p>Magic and the white skeleton birds. The wind caused by both sides crashed against each other.<br>The dark blue Dragon's Rage that was extremely hot heat up Cale&rsquo;s body.</p><p>&rsquo;Pretty much everyone here is the enemy.&rsquo;</p><p>Hilsman, Raon, and Valentino.<br>Everybody else other than the three of them were enemies.<br>That was why Cale made up his mind.</p><p>&rsquo;Let's just use enough to cough up a bit of blood.&rsquo;</p><p>There shouldn&rsquo;t be any danger since Raon was here.<br>However, the battlefield would become extremely chaotic if he used a lot of his strength and fainted.</p><p>Cale closed his eyes.</p><ul><li>Are you looking for me?</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Yes. I was looking for you.&rsquo;<br>The Sky Eating Water.<br>Her clear voice could be heard.</p><p>The water started to move following Cale's will.</p><p>Shaaaaaaa-</p><p>The wind was blowing.<br>The Imperial Prince looked toward Cale.</p><p>&rsquo;This is my first time seeing him use an ancient power other than the shield.&rsquo;</p><p>He had heard a lot of things from other people.<br>However, he had never personally seen Cale using this water ancient power.</p><p>&ldquo;···Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>One of the nobles subconsciously blurted out.</p><p>&rsquo;He's sparkling.<br>No. It is the water.&rsquo;<br>A half-transparent blue water was wrapping around Cale's waist.</p><p>&ldquo;...Oh, young master-nim.&rdquo;</p><p>Vice Captain Hilsman was watching that happen with admiration in his eyes.</p><p>One small person against the large fire.<br>The sparkling water that surrounded that human.<br>It didn't seem like much in comparison to the fire, but it was beautiful.</p><p>Cale naturally had no idea about this as his eyes were closed.<br>He was currently making a deal.</p><ul><li>Are you trying to eat up the XXX-like sky?</li></ul><p>&rsquo;No.&rsquo;<br>Cale thought about what he wanted and tried to make a deal with the Sky Eating Water.<br>Her clear voice rang inside his mind.</p><ul><li>Aha! That fire tornado must be hindering your freedom. Should I destroy it and make it XX so that it XXX? <span id="footnote-ref-6175"><a href="#footnote-6175">[1]</a></span></li></ul><p>&rsquo;This crazy water.&rsquo;<br>Cale shared his intentions with the water.<br>&rsquo;Let&rsquo;s just use enough power to barely put out that tornado.&rsquo;</p><ul><li>Alright. I will put out that tornado as you wish. &rsquo;Just enough so I don't fall over or faint.&rsquo;</li></ul><p>Cale could feel the water starting to move following his will.</p><p>It was different than the Dominating Water.<br>It was smooth.</p><p>It was like the slow spring rain or the drizzle that slightly wet your cheeks.<br>This was the first time Cale had this thought as he used an ancient power.</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s quiet.&rsquo;</p><p>He felt the power being as quiet as the lake he found it in.<br>He was worried at first because it was his first time using this power, however, he was relieved now.</p><p>He heard the Super Rock's voice for the first time in a long time.</p><ul><li>The predator stealthily and silently approaches before snapping the neck of its prey.</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Huh?&rsquo;</p><ul><li>The Sky Eating Water. Don't forget the meaning of its name.</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Perhaps?&rsquo;<br>It was the moment Cale flinched.<br>One of the Empire's mages shouted as his closed eyes squinted.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel an extremely large power!&rdquo;</p><p>That was the beginning.</p><p>&ldquo;S, something seems to be flowing underground!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is gathering together! They are all gathering together in one spot and creating an extremely large source of power!&rdquo;</p><p>Underground.<br>Water was flowing underground.<br>The small streams of water underground were all gathering together in one spot.</p><p>Only the high-grade mages around the Imperial Prince could feel this flow of water. Their pupils were shaking as they turned toward Cale.</p><p>A power different than mana.<br>The source of this power was nature.</p><p>A strong force was gathering underground.<br>And once that large force finally stopped growing in size...<br>Cale opened his eyes.<br>The Empire's forces could see something at the same time.</p><p>Craaaack-</p><p>The ground was cracking.<br>They could hear the sound of the ground cracking.</p><p>They could then see water shooting up from underground.<br>No, a sharp water spear shot out from the ground.</p><p>They could see the large dark blue fire tornado caused by the clashing of winds.<br>They turned toward that hellfire that was large enough to swallow up a city.</p><p>Booooooooooooom-</p><p>The water spear cut through that hellfire.<br>The spear made of blue water cut through the center of that dark blue tornado from the bottom up.</p><p>Baaaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>The flash and noise of the explosion made it so people could not properly use their ears or eyes for a moment.</p><p>The water ate up the dark blue fire.<br>The spear pierced through the center of the tornado and ripped it apart.</p><p>&ldquo;...M, my goodness-&rdquo;</p><p>All of the Empire&rsquo;s forces were looking at one spot.<br>That hellfire was slowly disappearing.<br>The water spear slowly started to disappear into the sky as well.</p><p>However, there was one existence that was not disappearing.<br>Their gazes all headed toward one person's back.</p><p>Commander Cale Henituse, the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s hero.<br>They could personally feel the miracle that the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s hero had created. They all had goosebumps on their skin.</p><p>Cale also got goosebumps.</p><p>&rsquo;...What the hell?&rsquo;</p><p>The fire was completely out.<br>No, it had disappeared without a trace. He could clearly see Maple Castle in front of him.</p><p>&rsquo;That was a fire made by ancient Dragon. It was able to get rid of that this easily?</p><p>I didn't even use that much strength, did I?&rsquo;<br>The Sky Eating Water took less time that the Dominating Water to eat up the Dragon's Rage.</p><ul><li>I can eat up anything and everything including the sky.</li></ul><p>He could hear the clear voice of the water again.<br>Cale slowly lowered his head and looked at his hands. His hands were shaking. He had a question as he looked at his hands.<br>He was not the only one.</p><ul><li>...Human, are you not coughing up blood? You're fine even after using that much power!</li></ul><p>&rsquo;That&rsquo;s exactly how I feel.&rsquo;<br>Raon and Cale had the same question.<br>The Super Rock chimed in at that moment.</p><ul><li>Water moves stealthily and quietly before launching a single hit.</li></ul><p>Cale flinched.</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;ll be calm until everything rushes in at once.</li></ul><p>Cale started to frown. His hand was slowly starting to shake faster and faster.<br>&rsquo;Perhaps?<br>Really?&rsquo;</p><ul><li>The aftershock of the water has always been strong. Be strong.</li></ul><p>Cale started to shout in anger.</p><p>&ldquo;Son of a, cough!&rdquo;</p><p>It was at that moment.<br>The dark red blood coming out of Cale&rsquo;s mouth caught the attention of everyone as the dark blue flame and the blue water had all disappeared.<br>The hero who had sacrificed himself was slowly falling to the ground.</p><hr><div id="footnote-6175"><p>1.
