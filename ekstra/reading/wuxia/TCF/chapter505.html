<p>&ldquo;That is not allowed.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale turned his head.<br>He could see Choi Han&rsquo;s stiff expression. He looked toward Cale and started to sternly speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what thoughts you are having right now, but no matter what they are, they are not allowed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Please let me tell you a fact.&rdquo;</p><p>Clang.</p><p>Choi Han slightly pulled his sword out of the scabbard.</p><p>&ldquo;You will die if you are stabbed in the heart. Blood is not allowed.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s vicious glare made Cale&rsquo;s already wildly beating heart beat even faster.</p><p>Forget being his senior or whatever, that gaze was really scary no matter what.<br>Extremely scary.<br>That was why he subconsciously responded like this.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you crazy? I'm someone who dreams about living a long life as a wealthy slacker!&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Ah.&rsquo;</p><p>He really ended up sharing his honest sentiments.</p><p>&ldquo;......&rdquo;</p><p>However, Choi Han just quietly observed him without saying anything.</p><p>&rsquo;...Why does it look like you are looking at me with pity?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale looked away as he could not meet Choi Han&rsquo;s gaze any longer. Pendrick started to speak at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, I delivered the World Tree-nim's message.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale looked at Pendrick and thought about the World Tree.</p><p>&rsquo;Does she know about the Vitality of the Heart that I have?&rsquo;</p><p>He felt iffy after thinking that the World Tree might know about all of his ancient powers.</p><p>&rsquo;...I thought she said my future was not visible.&rsquo;</p><p>Did she lie when she said that it was difficult to see the futures of people with ancient powers?</p><p>&rsquo;I don't think that it is that.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale had a lot to think about.<br>The problem was that this was not the time to thoroughly think things through.</p><p>&ldquo;Grooooooooa-&rdquo;</p><p>There was a shaman on the ground twitching and groaning in pain.</p><p>Baaaaaang!<br>Boom.<br>Boobooboooooooooom-!</p><p>He also heard things breaking in all directions.</p><p>&rsquo;Aren't they all just destroying things without thinking about what to do after that?&rsquo;</p><p>Everybody seemed to be using all their powers as if there was no tomorrow. He needed to stop that.<br>They needed to conserve some strength to escape from the palace and reunite with Bud&rsquo;s side.</p><ul><li>...Excuse me.</li></ul><p>The fake World Tree cautiously started to speak at that moment. They could chat because there were branches still holding Cale up.<br>Cale looked toward the World Tree.</p><p>&ldquo;Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p><p>However, Choi Han called out to him, making him motion for Choi Han to hold on for a moment. However, he turned toward Choi Han after hearing what he said next.</p><p>&ldquo;This fake tree is being controlled by Elisneh. It is resisting it right now, but it can only maintain that for about 20 more minutes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...20 minutes?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes. That is why we planned to destroy the maze during that time, injure the enemies as much as possible, and leave with you, Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale started to frown.<br>It was only 30 minutes if he added the time he had been unconscious. It was a short amount of time.</p><p>&ldquo;Were you all attacking at full strength because you didn't have much time?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is correct. I thought that escaping was the most important thing right now. I also thought that it would be difficult for Elisneh to cast an illusion properly if we were running wild like this.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han was correct.</p><p>&rsquo;That is true, but...&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han. You can&rsquo;t use all of your strength without saving any for when an urgent situation might pop up later. Make sure nobody goes overboard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...I understand.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han was silent for a few seconds before responding.<br>However, Cale turned his gaze after feeling an odd sensation only to find Pendrick looking at him with an odd expression.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it? Do you have something to say?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;N, no.&rdquo;</p><p>Pendrick was shaking his head but still looking at Cale with disbelief.<br>He could clearly see that Cale was pale and had dry blood on his lips from using his ancient powers. That was why he couldn't believe what Cale was saying.</p><p>&rsquo;...He truly cares more about his friends than his own body. No wonder he was able to overcome the illusion.&rsquo;</p><p>Pendrick understood what Choi Han, who was standing there with a stiff expression, must be feeling. Anybody serving such a liege would feel frustrated but also respect that person.</p><p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;First, let the others know that I woke up-&rdquo;<br>-H, h, humaaaaaaaaaaan-!</p><p>&rsquo;...Ha. Something always pops up when I try to do something.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale started to frown as he thought about the invisible Dragon that was probably charging toward him right now.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He then flinched.<br>Something had slammed into the tree.<br>He was certain it was Raon.</p><p>&ldquo;...Raon. Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Human! You woke up?</li></ul><p>However, Raon didn't seem to hear Cale&rsquo;s question.</p><ul><li>I'm relieved! Human, I'm destroying the maze right now! I'll turn the maze walls into sand!</li></ul><p>...The six-years-old Dragon's vocabulary was increasing, but it seemed to be moving in a dangerous direction.</p><ul><li>Weak human, you sit still. We will take care of everything! Hey black tree, don't let him out! The human will faint if you let him out!</li></ul><p>Squeeze.</p><p>The black tree enveloped Cale a little tighter.<br>Cale could not help but sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Haaaaa.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Ah right! We got a call from the crown prince!<br>&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</li></ul><p>A video communication device suddenly appeared in the air and headed for Choi Han&rsquo;s hand.<br>The red video communication device was immediately connected.</p><ul><li>Why did you take so long to answ-! ...Dongsaeng. Are you captured somewhere?</li></ul><p>Alberu who had answered the call with a look of urgency looked confused.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing much, sir. What is going on?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Tsk.</li></ul><p>Alberu lightly clicked his tongue.<br>Cale&rsquo;s appearance was terrible for it to be nothing much. It even made him debate if he needed to find some good medicine for Cale.<br>However, Alberu did not have time to think about such things right now.</p><ul><li>We got information that some suspicious individuals have entered the northwest region.</li></ul><p>Cale&rsquo;s gaze instantly changed. His body automatically leaned closer to the video communication device.</p><p>The White Star needed to go to the Roan Kingdom's northwest region, the third potential spot for the earth attribute ancient power.<br>The White Star could openly invade the Roan Kingdom, but Cale had thought it was more likely for him to stealthily have his subordinates infiltrate the Roan Kingdom's northwest region.</p><p>That was why Alberu had sent people throughout the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s northwest region to look for suspicious people.</p><ul><li>They seems to be the White Star&rsquo;s subordinates as we expected.<br>&ldquo;I see. In that case-&rdquo;</li><li>That is why I am busy. I will send the important info via messages.<br>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</li><li>I'm busy. Until later then. Take care of your body.</li></ul><p>Click.</p><p>The call ended.<br>Cale was silent for a moment.</p><p>Ooooooooong-</p><p>He heard the video communication device go off again. It happened as Cale was about to turn back toward the video communication device expecting it to be Alberu's message.</p><p>&ldquo;...How-! How did you already!&rdquo;</p><p>He could hear Elisneh&rsquo;s piercing scream.<br>Elisneh who was shocked after seeing that Cale was awake was heading toward him with the shamans. Cale's gaze headed toward them.</p><p>&ldquo;The young master-nim is awake! Block them!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Commander-nim is awake! Increase the speed even more and focus on getting out of here!&rdquo;</p><p>Tasha and Jeet thought about Cale&rsquo;s condition and gave orders to their respective subordinates.<br>Elisneh was still looking at Cale with a shocked expression. She seemed even more shocked than when Choi Han had come out of her illusion.</p><p>&ldquo;T, t, that sir said that it was an illusion that would make a person face their greatest fear-!&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t much of a fear.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale snorted. He did not see Choi Han&rsquo;s vicious gaze or invisible Raon's sparkling eyes because he was looking at Elisneh.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>He suddenly heard a suppressed groan.<br>Cale looked toward the direction of the groan in shock. He saw someone flying away at a distance.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The shaman with glasses fell to the ground and rolled. He looked limp as if he had fainted, and the person who had kicked him pulled out his sword.</p><p>&ldquo;Three left.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han said that as he headed toward Elisneh and the shamans. He said one more thing as he moved.</p><p>&ldquo;Please get some rest.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, he had thrown the video communication device to Cale.</p><p>Shhhh.</p><p>The black tree&rsquo;s branches made a gap to catch the video communication device and handed it to Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;Ho.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale gasped while looking at what happened. He then had an odd expression on his face.</p><p>&rsquo;...It looks like they&rsquo;ll be able to take care of most bastards on their own even without me.&rsquo;</p><p>He thought that things might get a little easier for him as he looked down at the video communication device. He needed to check the crown prince&rsquo;s message.</p><p>He then became anxious.</p><p>Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep-</p><p>The sharp noise of an alarm echoed in his ear and made Cale's face freeze.</p><p>&ldquo;...As I expected.&rdquo;</p><p>He bit down on his lips for a moment after seeing who was calling.<br>He had expected it. That was why he connected the call immediately.<br>He had an ominous feeling about this red light that was even brighter than the one from Alberu earlier.</p><ul><li>Human, I'm connecting it right away!</li></ul><p>Cale nodded his head and looked toward the screen with concern.<br>It must be an emergency if this person was calling.</p><ul><li>Cale-nim.</li></ul><p>Clopeh Sekka's cold and stiff face appeared on the screen.</p><ul><li>We found Lion King Dorph in the forest near the Lake of Despair.</li></ul><p>Cale&rsquo;s eyes started to sink after hearing that what he expected but didn't want to happen was happening.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Cale-nim, we found Lion King Dorph in the forest near the Lake of Despair.&rdquo;</p><p>Clopeh Sekka sent that message as he looked down.</p><p>&ldquo;Captain-nim.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>He quieted his subordinate. His cold gaze was looking at a spot on the ground.</p><p>&rsquo;It is as Cale-nim expected.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale and crown prince Alberu had contacted Clopeh a few days ago to talk about an urgent need to cooperate.<br>It was not for the Paerun Kingdom but just for Clopeh.</p><p>&lt; We believe it is highly likely that the White Star's subordinates will infiltrate the Lake of Despair, one of the Five Forbidden Regions. We are requesting your cooperation during that situation. &gt;</p><p>Clopeh recalled the contents of that contract.</p><ul><li>It is as I expected.</li></ul><p>Cale&rsquo;s voice sounded cold and low.<br>Cale had been worried about something while planning the trip to the fake World Tree.</p><p>&rsquo;The Elves already tried and failed once.&rsquo;</p><p>The reason for it was the dead mana liquid.<br>Cale had thought about this attempt through the White Star's perspective instead of the Elves.<br>He would think that the Elves would attempt to come to destroy the fake World Tree again.</p><p>&rsquo;He probably expected for me to be involved as well.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale had a connection with the Elves after saving the Ten Finger Mountains&rsquo; Elf Village in the past.<br>The White Star's side would have expected the Elves to ask for Cale&rsquo;s help and that they would come in large numbers.<br>That was why once they thought about Cale and the Elves coming to the Eastern continent...</p><p>&rsquo;They would have expected the Western continent to be empty as well.&rsquo;</p><p>If Cale was the White Star, he would try to protect the fake World Tree while attempting to destroy the real World Tree at the same time.<br>That suspicion was correct.</p><ul><li>You remember our plan?</li></ul><p>Clopeh gave a short, &rsquo;yes, Cale-nim,&rsquo; in response.<br>He had naturally agreed to take part.<br>It helped that the contract had discussed the benefits for Clopeh, but...</p><p>&rsquo;...Most importantly, it is getting involved in the path of a legend.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Keke.&rdquo;</p><p>The corners of Clopeh&rsquo;s mouth slowly started to go up.<br>An unbearable level of passion-filled him up.<br>Cale had sent him a separate message along with the contract.</p><p>&lt; I told a few wyverns to follow you for a set amount of time. &gt;</p><p>Of course, Choi Han was actually the one to order the wyverns.</p><p>&lt; The wyverns will follow your orders. You may use the wyverns as you please in addition to our request during that time. &gt;</p><p>Clopeh licked his lips with his tongue.</p><p>&rsquo;I should be able to organize the north a bit after taking care of this situation.&rsquo;</p><p>His eyes sparkled.<br>Someone else was the hero and the legend, but shouldn't he at least be the ruler of the north?</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;We are going down.&rdquo;</p><p>There were tens of wyverns. The knights on top of those wyverns started to quickly descend to the spot Clopeh pointed out.</p><p>Clopeh also headed down to the forest.<br>He heard Cale&rsquo;s voice at that moment.</p><ul><li>Win. If you can't win, persist. Persisting for as long as possible is the most important part.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Cale-nim.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>&rsquo;I need to help out in writing a page in your legend.&rsquo;</p><p>Clopeh turned toward a direction.<br>He saw Lion King Dorph who looked just as Cale described, quickly moving toward the Lake of Despair with the Lion tribe.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm!&rdquo;</p><p>He could see Dorph being shocked to see the descending Clopeh.<br>He had a twisted smile on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! Looks like you found us.&rdquo;</p><p>Clopeh immediately gave an order to the knights.</p><p>"Get ready!&rdquo;</p><p>The knights tightened their grips. Their arms and shoulders swung back with long steel spears in their hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Throw!&rdquo;</p><p>The long spears flew toward the forest once Clopeh gave the order.</p><p>&ldquo;You bastards!&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph had recognized Clopeh right away. A dark barrier was created by his hands.<br>The rest of the Lions took out shields or hid behind trees to dodge the spears.</p><p>Baaaaaang!<br>Boom- boom! Bang! Baaaaang!</p><p>Dorph&rsquo;s&rsquo; black barrier and the knights&rsquo; long spears crashed and caused quite some loud noises.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph frowned after blocking the long spears and then glared at the person coming down toward the forest.</p><p>&ldquo;...Clopeh Sekka.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh. You know who I am?&rdquo;</p><p>Clopeh put on his holy-looking knight&rsquo;s smile.<br>Dorph looked relaxed again as he snorted toward Clopeh.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! Clopeh Sekka! Do you even know what is here? You bastard.-&rdquo;<br>&rsquo;That&rsquo;s none of my business.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</p><p>Clopeh didn&rsquo;t know what was in the Lake of Despair.<br>However...</p><p>&ldquo;I'm just helping out in the path of a legend. I don&rsquo;t care about anything else.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...What kind of, this crazy bastard-&rdquo;</p><p>Dorph shouted with a shocked expression.</p><p>&ldquo;You're supposed to be the Guardian Knight of the North but you just do whatever Cale Henituse orders you to do?&rdquo;</p><p>The smile disappeared from Clopeh's face at that moment.<br>Clopeh started to speak with a stoic expression as a calm but firm voice flowed out.</p><p>&ldquo;You're so stupid.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What reason do you need to help out in the process of a legend and a hero being created?&rdquo;</p><p>The corners of Clopeh's lips rose again and his eyes started to sparkle.<br>Before Dorph could think that he had the gaze of a lunatic...</p><p>Rustle. Rustle.</p><p>As he heard the sound of leaves...</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>Some trees were split in half as a whip burst out between them.</p><p>Flick-</p><p>The whip instantly grabbed one of the Lions who were hiding behind a tree to avoid the long spears.</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>The Lion groaned after they heard the noise.</p><p>The Lake of Despair and the World Tree.<br>Clopeh Sekka was Cale&rsquo;s first safety net to protect this place.<br>The second safety net had now appeared as well.</p><p>Dorph started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;...The Whale has come out of the water.&rdquo;</p><p>The Ruler of the Ocean, Witira had appeared through one of the split trees.</p> <a href="./chapter504.html" class="chapter-nav">
