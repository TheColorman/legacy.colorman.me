<p>Tang! Tang! Tang!</p>
<p>The chains fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The Ranger Brigade members started to stretch their bodies that felt light after finally having their chains come off.</p>
<p>Peek peek.</p>
<p>They continued to peek somewhere as they did that.</p>
<p>They were peeking at Deputy Chief Priest Cotton.</p>
<p>Flip, flip.</p>
<p>She was quickly flipping through the document in her hand.</p>
<p>Her chubby hands that were holding the document were shaking.</p>
<p>Tap!</p>
<p>She finished reading and handed the document to Solena as she turned toward Cale.</p>
<p>She then started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such crazy shit......!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Can a Deputy Chief Priest talk like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale gently smiled. However, Cotton's gaze was fierce.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...He got it good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She wanted to grab Duke Fredo by the collar and shake him right now because of this sudden change in plans.</p>
<p>However, it had already happened. She had no choice but to go along with this new plan.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Most importantly, it&rsquo;s not a bad plan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked away from Cale Henituse who had a sly expression on his face.</p>
<p>Cale chuckled in response and turned toward Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let's go.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud walked toward Cale, Rosalyn, and Eruhaben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leader?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud smiled at the Ranger Brigade members who were looking at him in confusion.</p>
<p>Sniff sniff. </p>
<p>He sniffed with his nose like a dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They need my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn walked past Bud and stood next to Glenn.</p>
<p>Bud pointed at Rosalyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be taking my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn smiled and shook Glenn's hand.</p>
<p>She looked toward the Ranger Brigade members and Cale as she started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will finish all preparations so that we can move as soon as we get your signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale slightly bowed toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Thank you. See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn waved her hand while Cotton's baggy priestess robe fluttered as she headed toward the entrance of the underground hideout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She handed priest robes to the people who followed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are my trusted subordinates&rsquo; priest robes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were small markings on the shoulder of those robes.</p>
<p>She handed them masks and hats as well as she continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be easy changing your hair colors with magic, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was talking to Cale but her gaze was focused on Eruhaben.</p>
<p>Eruhaben lightly snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>Cale, Bud, and Eruhaben&rsquo;s appearances changed with that small snap.</p>
<p>They all now had the common brown hair. Of course, the shades of the hairs were all different.</p>
<p>Cale brushed his light brown hair back and put the priest robe over his clothes.</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Priest opened the door.</p>
<p>"We are heading to the Temple of the Demonic God. Follow me closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deputy Chief Priest's true trusted subordinates were already waiting outside.</p>
<p>Cale, Bud, and Eruhaben headed to the center of those trusted subordinates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton took the lead and the trusted subordinates followed.</p>
<p>Cale, who was standing at the center of the formation, looked toward the center of Section 2.</p>
<p>He could see the oddly-shaped white marble temple.</p>
<p>That was the Temple of the Demonic God.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;I, I cannot do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Mock shook his head with a pale expression.</p>
<p>However, the person standing in front of him slightly tilted his head to the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in a position to say that you can&rsquo;t do something right now?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What kind of-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead if you can't do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The lips underneath the black half-mask smiled as beautifully as a painting.</p>
<p>&rsquo;This crazy-!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Count Mock glared at Informant Bob who was smiling at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he soon groaned as the rope binding him tightened.</p>
<p>He then heard a firm voice behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't we just kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Mock's face turned pale.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of the Dark Elf half-blood in front of him. This bastard was unique because he could use magic, but that wasn&rsquo;t a big obstacle for Mock.</p>
<p>However, he could not say the same for the woman behind his back right now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want to get rid of anything related to the White Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pressure she then gave off was even stronger than Dragon Fear.</p>
<p>Mock was sweating bullets because of this pressure that was focused solely on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo hoo. Count Mock, you look terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mock started to frown at Duke Fredo who was smiling at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...You damn traitor-&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A sharp sword appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk too much. Just hurry up and answer whether it is possible or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han&rsquo;s sword was pointed at him.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Motherfucker!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mock truly felt upset at this situation.</p>
<p>&rsquo;How did I, the great Mock, end up like this?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His insides felt like they were flipping over.</p>
<p>Nobody cared and the weakest but most heinous bastard pushed a document toward Mock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, that&rsquo;s your script.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu gently continued to speak to Count Mock who was glaring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just report to the White Star following the script when I give you the signal later.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...How can I lie to my liege that I conquered this Black Castle?&rdquo;<br>
"What's wrong? It&rsquo;s not that hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mock was at a loss for words at Informant Bob's response. Alberu didn&rsquo;t care as he got up and patted Count Mock's shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're dead if he finds out because you're so stiff like earlier. Let&rsquo;s practice a lot so that you look natural. You have to do it naturally. Got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mock&rsquo;s shoulders slumped down.</p>
<p>Alberu left him in the room and walked out with Duke Fredo and Choi Han.</p>
<p>It was because Lord Sheritt said that she would watch over Mock.</p>
<p>The three of them walked into the next room.</p>
<p>Raon, who was sitting in front of a video communication device, fluttered his wings as soon as they came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The human hasn&rsquo;t contacted us yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the strategy room.</p>
<p>Alberu pointed to a seat in the strategy room next to Duke Fredo, who still thought that he was actually Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we sit down and wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu, Choi Han, and Fredo all sat down inside the strategy room.</p>
<p>They just had to wait for Cale to contact them now.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Deputy Chief Priest-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A priest slightly bowed toward Cotton with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please work hard a little longer as it is a tiring but happy day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gently cheered on the priest whose arms were full of gifts for the citizens and entered the Temple of the Demonic God.</p>
<p>Her trusted subordinates were walking right behind her.</p>
<p>Of course, her trusted subordinates were holding gifts and other items as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Deputy Chief Priest-nim! Did everything go smoothly with what you needed to do?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Of course. I brought back everything we needed.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Oh! I'm relieved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every priest they passed talked to her or respectfully greeted her.</p>
<p>Cotton heard someone right behind her start to whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton quietly whispered with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut the hell up.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You're quite an amazing talker, Deputy Chief Priest.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;This much is good for the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton lightly responded to Cale who was following behind her while disguised as a priest.</p>
<p>Cale was stealthily looking around rather than looking at her.</p>
<ul>
<li>The atmosphere here is not as evil as I had expected it would be.</li>
</ul>
<p>He heard Eruhaben's voice in his mind. Cale nodded his head without making it look too visible.</p>
<p>The Temple of a Demonic God.</p>
<p>This place that the Chief Priest was said to take special care to maintain was pretty empty even though it was festival time.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Most of them are in the garden outside the building.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Temple of the Demonic God had set up close to a hundred long tables in the garden to treat the visiting citizens.</p>
<p>Sniff sniff.</p>
<p>He heard Bud sniffing behind him.</p>
<p>Cotton headed deeper into the Temple as Bud&rsquo;s sniffing became more frequent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton stopped walking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who are carrying things, deliver the goods to their respective locations. The rest of you come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave orders to her trusted subordinates and over half of them started to move elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cotton only took Cale's group and a few of her trusted subordinates as she walked forward again.</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be over there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cale heard Eruhaben's voice and observed the large door in front of him.</p>
<p>A black door that did not fit this white building was blocking their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deputy Chief Priest-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Multiple priests stationed outside the door holding swords and spears recognized her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are working hard even during a day like today.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Not at all. Deputy Chief Priest-nim, did you come to pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton nodded to the priests who were serving as the guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a joyous day, so I wanted to show my respects before it became busier.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priests opened the door.</p>
<p>The door seemed to be so heavy that multiple people had to push it.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>The door slowly opened.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Ho-&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale barely managed to hold back his gasp.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What is that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the large empty area...</p>
<p>There was a seriously heinous looking human sculpture on the high platform at the center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let's go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton walked into the area.</p>
<p>Cale matched the trusted subordinates&rsquo; movements as he walked in as well.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...It's cold in here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This area was cold unlike the outside.</p>
<p>The air in here was colder than in the other parts of the temple. That temperature and the heinous human sculpture together gave him the chills.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The black door closed again.</p>
<p>Cale turned toward the closed door. He heard Cotton&rsquo;s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody bothers my prayer time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned toward Cotton. Her trusted subordinates quickly walked over to the black door and stationed themselves there as she motioned with her hand.</p>
<p>Clang.</p>
<p>Of course, they took weapons out of their pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since this place was created, the rule is that nobody opens the door while Gersey, the White Star, or I am praying in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smile. </p>
<p>Cotton started to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the only way for the White Star to progress with becoming a member of the Demonic race without any disturbances. And that is going to be advantageous for us right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She finished speaking and started to head toward the sculpture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to go underground using the hidden passage in this sculpture. Just wait a little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked at the sculpture as he waited.</p>
<p>Bud walked up next to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I'm not sure either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eruhaben was the one who answered.</p>
<p>He was looking at the sculpture as if he found it odd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This human's face looks extremely heinous and as if he has fallen into despair. But I cannot tell who it is.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Me neither. But it must be someone related to the White Star if he would create this sculpture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud agreed with Eruhaben's assessment before turning toward Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was just asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud, Eruhaben, and Cotton all looked toward him in shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton was the one with the most shocked reaction. She stopped opening the passage and turned toward Cale in shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you see him?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I have no plans on telling you, so just open the passage.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ha..........&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton started to frown as she resumed moving the device to open the passage. It seemed to require a special power to activate, as the ring on her finger was giving off some kind of power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale shook his head at Eruhaben's question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Star&rsquo;s face without a mask.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ho-&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eruhaben gasped in shock.</p>
<p>&rsquo;How shocking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eruhaben who had been looking at the sculpture while wondering if a human being could have such a heinous expression had to look at the sculpture in a different light now.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What...is making the White Star have such an expression?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He felt an odd sensation as a question filled his mind.</p>
<p>As the Deputy Chief Priest had mentioned...</p>
<p>&rsquo;How does Cale know about the White Star&rsquo;s bare face?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eruhaben had not heard about the information Cale had gathered from Duke Fredo yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has such a vicious expression. He wouldn't look so heinous if he had a regular expression on his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Bud's assessment of the sculpture.</p>
<p>As for Cale, he was looking at the sculpture of the White Star&rsquo;s bare face with an odd sensation.</p>
<p>&rsquo;My face really looks despicable with that kind of heinous expression.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Seeing this face on a sculpture made him really think that Kim Rok Soo and the White Star looked quite similar.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I need to make sure to destroy this thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo never had such an expression.</p>
<p>Cale walked up to the sculpture with an iffy expression.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Did the White Star want people to worship him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale found it laughable that such a sculpture existed at the center of the Temple of the Demonic God.</p>
<p>It made him think that the White Star really was out of his mind.</p>
<p>Cale walked a little closer. He wanted to take a closer look.</p>
<p>Screeeeeeeech, screeeeech-</p>
<p>Cale saw the sculpture move up at that moment. He stopped walking and turned toward Cotton.</p>
<p>Cotton pointed to the passage that appeared now that the sculpture had moved up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in, so follow me closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked into the passage without any hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to hurry because you wasted some time with the hostages.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it still plenty of time before one hour is up?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Did you not look at the information Duke Fredo gave you?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale responded as he walked down.</p>
<p>It seemed like a typical underground passage, however, it was extremely large. It was wide enough for ten adults to walk side by side.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Something is weird.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The coldness he felt in the area above became even colder.</p>
<p>He could clearly tell that the temperature here was much lower than outside.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...This is weird.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For some odd reason, it made Cale start to have an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>This unexplainable sense of uncertainty swept over him. It gave him the chills.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Why do I feel this way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He heard Cotton&rsquo;s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the information Duke Fredo gave you should have said, the underground facility is divided into three locations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She quickly walked down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gersey and the White Star can go to all three places. I am only allowed in two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>The sound of the four people walking down echoed through the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the most important place is the third location. The place I can't go. We must go in there and destroy it today.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What proof do you have that the third location is the most important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale asked since the reasoning was not mentioned in the information he received last time.</p>
<p>Why was Cotton emphasizing that the third location was the most important?</p>
<p>They reached the end of the staircase.</p>
<p>Cotton started to speak with a serious expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don't have time, so I&rsquo;ll explain on our way over. I definitely have proof to back me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes seemed confident that the proof she found was reliable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the staircase... This place looked like a naturally constructed cave.</p>
<p>However, the things inside were not natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a dead mana storage facility. The White Star absorbs the dead mana here periodically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The numerous large beautiful glass containers were full of black liquid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These were all someone&rsquo;s life in the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud had a bitter expression on his face.</p>
<p>However, Cale calmly counted the number of glass containers as he started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should move all these black liquids elsewhere.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Looks like I need to step in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eruhaben walked toward the glass containers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eruhaben said it was easy, but it was actually difficult. There were quite a lot of them.</p>
<p>Shh. </p>
<p>Eruhaben put his hand on one of the glass containers.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep- beeeeeeeeeeeeeep-</p>
<p>A sharp noise echoed around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Shit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton turned pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found us!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale walked over to her in shock.</p>
<p>Cotton took an orb out of her pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the signal my trusted subordinates were to send if they were caught! Who is it? Who found us? It&rsquo;s not the White Star!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Cale and urgently continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gersey! I'm sure Gersey is the one who found us! My trusted subordinate would not have been able to send me a signal if it was the White Star! They&rsquo;d be dead long before they could do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bit down on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Gersey was supposed to come an hour later, so why did he come here earlier? He&rsquo;s kept this rule for many years, so what changed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes looked chaotic.</p>
<p>Beeeeeep- Beeeeeeep-</p>
<p>The alarm started to get louder.</p>
<p>Bud who was watching this walked over to Cale in shock.</p>
<p>"Hey, what do we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Cracks were starting to appear on the orb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton threw the orb into the air.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>The orb then exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...This orb is connected by the power of those who serve the Demonic race. Only another priest could destroy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cotton's eyes filled with fear and urgency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain. Gersey has found us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will chase after us.&rdquo;</p> <a href="./chapter550.html" class="chapter-nav">
