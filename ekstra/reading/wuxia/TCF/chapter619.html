<p>Cale started to walk down the stairs of the watchtower.</p><p>The first thing he saw was Choi Han waiting for him.</p><p>Pat.</p><p>Cale put his hand on Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Rok Soo hyung, are you done with your chat?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han's gaze headed over Cale&rsquo;s shoulder toward Lee Soo Hyuk who had walked down as well.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm sure there is a reason our Han is so courteous to Rok Soo as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han showed a level of politeness that could not be simply explained through a hyung-dongsaeng relationship.</p><p>He could sense a deep bond between the two.</p><p>Choi Han nodded his head at Lee Soo Hyuk's statement.</p><p>&ldquo;I am Choi Jung Soo&rsquo;s paternal cousin once removed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk blankly asked back while Cale calmly added on.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a senior. A total senior. He&rsquo;s even older than Grandma Kim, hyung-nim.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk was silent for a moment before he started to speak.</p><p>"This is the most shocking thing I've heard.&rdquo;</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>Taaaaap- taaaaaap-</p><p>They heard some footsteps and saw Kim Min Joon running toward them with walkie-talkies.</p><p>"Commander-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>The monster has appeared.</p><p>He was about to shout that before stopping himself. It was because he realized that Cale must have already seen everything from the watchtower.</p><p>Instead, he just handed a walkie-talkie into Cale&rsquo;s outstretched hand.</p><p>"Are you okay, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Min Joon cautiously asked.</p><p>Smile.</p><p>He could see the corners of Cale&rsquo;s lips moving up.</p><p>The Commander walked past Kim Min Joon.</p><p>&ldquo;Let's go.&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Min Joon quickly turned around and looked at his commander's back.</p><p>His back was not shaking.</p><p>It was small, but it felt as if it was the largest and strongest back.</p><p>&rsquo;This time!&rsquo;</p><p>We can finally see the end of that monster this time.</p><p>His instincts were telling him that that would be the case.</p><p>Kim Min Joon followed behind Cale, Lee Soo Hyuk, and Choi Han and walked along the shelter wall.</p><p>Cale was walking toward his destination without any hesitation.</p><p>&ldquo;Commander!&rdquo;<br>"Commander-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>Many people greeted him as he walked along the wall.</p><p>The monster had appeared again.</p><p>The yellow head was charging toward them through the fog that was covering the sun.</p><p>Could they win?</p><p>The people were half-filled with fear and half-filled with worry, but they all clenched their weapons after seeing the calm and peaceful demeanor of the person in charge.</p><p>&ldquo;...Commander.&rdquo;</p><p>Heo Sook Ja was guarding the shelter gate.</p><p>She made eye contact with the approaching commander.</p><p>&ldquo;Please open the gate.&rdquo;</p><p>Heo Sook Ja did not say anything back to Cale.</p><p>She just gave the signal.</p><p>Screeeech-</p><p>The gate opened and wind gathered around Cale's ankles.</p><p>He then jumped over the ledge and fell down.</p><p>Swiiiiiiiish- Swiiiiiiiish-</p><p>The wind carried him down before he landed on a fluffy back.</p><p>&ldquo;What day is it on the other side?&rdquo;</p><p>The owner of the fluffy back responded to Cale's question.</p><p>&ldquo;I fell asleep one minute into November 9th.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale picked up the walkie-talkie and started to speak after he heard Alberu's response.</p><p>&ldquo;All units, to your positions.&rdquo;</p><p>The Dark Tiger's radiant black mane was fluttering as it rushed forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhsss!&rdquo;</p><p>He could see the yellow head in front of him.</p><p>It was no longer bleeding, but there were large scars where its eyes should have been. The poisonous fangs were no longer present either.</p><p>Crackle. Crack.</p><p>However, the currents surrounding its body...</p><p>Chhhhh-</p><p>The water...</p><p>And finally...</p><p>Craaaaaaack.</p><p>The dirt pillars shooting up through the ground as if to protect the yellow head were all present.</p><p>The dirt pillars were spinning like whirlwinds as if to prevent the enemies from approaching.</p><p>&rsquo;It also has its sound ability and its scales.&rsquo;</p><p>But those things weren't very difficult for Cale to handle now.</p><p>He spoke into the walkie-talkie.</p><p>"We will proceed as planned.&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae shouted from on top of the shelter wall as soon as he said that.</p><p>&ldquo;Blast it!&rdquo;</p><p>He then pulled the trigger of his gun.</p><p>The bullet shot out into the air.</p><p>It then exploded.</p><p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>That was the beginning.</p><p>People all around the shelter walls were launching long-distance attacks into the air.</p><p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>The explosions were continuing without stopping.</p><p>It made their ears go numb.</p><p>&ldquo;Chhhhhhhh!&rdquo;</p><p>The yellow head started to frown.</p><p>Cale started to smile.</p><p>"All you can hear are explosions from every direction, right?&rdquo;</p><p>If they made a blind monster unable to listen to anything either...</p><p>"Then what will you be able to do, you little bastard?&rdquo;</p><p>If it could not see and if it could not hear...</p><p>&ldquo;Is all that you have left your sense of touch?&rdquo;</p><p>In that case...</p><p>&ldquo;Then we just have to tie that down as well.&rdquo;</p><p>The preparations had been completed a long time ago.</p><p>&ldquo;We will destroy the dirt pillars around the monster first.&rdquo;</p><p>His message reached Kim Min Joon and was directed to a different group.</p><ul><li>Yes, hyung-nim.</li></ul><p>Choi Han.</p><ul><li>Got it.</li></ul><p>Lee Soo Hyuk.</p><ul><li><p>I understand, sir!</p></li><li><p>Yes, sir! I understand!</p></li></ul><p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum.</p><ul><li>This walkie-talkie is too small for my hands.</li></ul><p>The final individual was the large White Rabbit, Mr. Rabbit, and his hands that were too big for the walkie-talkie.</p><p>While the yellow head had been away...</p><p>Everybody at the shelter had not just been relaxing as they waited.</p><p>They had hunted most of the monsters around the Seomyeon central shelter.</p><p>Thanks to that, there were much fewer monsters to run wild along with the appearance of the unranked monster such that Mr. Rabbit was able to participate in this battle as well.</p><p>"We will move after them!&rdquo;</p><p>The other attack squads would follow behind this group in the front.</p><p>And in the sky...</p><p>&ldquo;My little dongsaeng! I brought this crazy bastard!&rdquo;</p><p>The Steel Feather Hawk opened her wings out to the side.</p><p>Joo Ho-Shik who was on her back clasped his hands together and started to shout.</p><p>&ldquo;I have faith!&rdquo;</p><p>A wide-area buff surrounded the attackers in the front.</p><p>&ldquo;I never expected to be so happy to hear him say that crazy shit!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My words exactly!&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Min Ah's spear shot out toward a large dirt pillar in front of her.</p><p>Swooooooosh-</p><p>Bae Puh Rum supported her with his wind.</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>One of the dirt pillars crumbled after being pierced by the spear.</p><p>Kim Min Ah's Herculean Strength had become even more amplified because of Joo Ho-Shik's faith ability.</p><p>But she looked around and shook her head in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;My goodness.&rdquo;</p><p>Slash.</p><p>A sword slashed through the hair with a quiet noise.</p><p>A few moments later...</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>There was a loud explosion as a dirt pillar was cut in half.</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk moved past the crumbling dirt pillar with a stoic expression before slashing toward the next dirt pillar.</p><p>He was fast.</p><p>But there was someone who was even faster.</p><p>Baaang, baaaang, baaang!</p><p>Dirt pillars were falling down nonstop.</p><p>Dirt pillars were crumbling without any resistance every time a black light shot out from Choi Han's sword.</p><p>"Wow, he's no joke.&rdquo;</p><p>Bae Puh Rum was shaking as if he was scared.</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk and Choi Han seemed amazing to him.</p><p>&ldquo;...Bae Puh Rum.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s increase our speed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I'm overflowing with energy right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Clench.</p><p>Veins were popping out of Kim Min Ah's hand that was clenching the spear.</p><p>Bae Puh Rum quickly nodded his head after seeing her smiling as if this was fun.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay! I'm suddenly full of energy too!&rdquo;</p><p>The two of them proceeded to silently destroy dirt pillar after dirt pillar.</p><p>But they stopped moving after seeing someone who was destroying them even faster than Choi Han.</p><p>&ldquo;Hoo hoo. How easy.&rdquo;</p><p>Boom.</p><p>He jumped up.</p><p>&ldquo;I just.&rdquo;</p><p>A large pair of white ears moved in a diagonal line.</p><p>&ldquo;I just need to slap it with my damn ears.&rdquo;</p><p>Boooooooom-</p><p>The dirt pillar in the way of the ears crumbled to the ground.</p><p>Boom.</p><p>The White Rabbit then gently landed on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm. I suppose it is not bad to learn about them since they are enemies I will need to face in the future.&rdquo;</p><p>His red eyes looked toward the unranked monster.</p><p>Now that he had made up his mind to build a home in Korea... Unranked monsters were enemies that Mr. Rabbit had to fight, regardless of the fact that they were stronger than him.</p><p>&ldquo;Until later then, cute children-nims.&rdquo;</p><p>He gave a gentle goodbye before moving past Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum.</p><p>He then jumped up looking as light as a flower petal before swinging his 'damn ears&rsquo; toward another dirt pillar.</p><p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>Dirt pillars were crumbling all around them.</p><p>There was a Dark Tiger that was continuously charging forward through the crumbling pillars.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I just need to keep charging forward?&rdquo;</p><p>He asked Cale who was on his back and Cale grabbed the mane tightly as he calmly responded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Hyung-nim, I will destroy anything that gets in your way.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ha, haha-&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu laughed at that response.</p><p>He then mischievously asked back.</p><p>"And I just carry my dongsaeng to that monster?&rdquo;<br>"That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a very easy job.</p><p>Alberu started to speak as he continued to charge toward the yellow-headed monster.</p><p>"Cale, there&rsquo;s something you need to know.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is it, your highness?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale lowered his head to look at Alberu.</p><p>Alberu responded in a calm voice.</p><p>"We failed to destroy the sculptures.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale also responded in a calm voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. They were transforming dead mana into something before feeding it to the sculptures as nutrients.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that so? From where, no, who did they kill to get dead mana this time?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale shook his head and continued to speak as if he had come to a conclusion.</p><p>&ldquo;What a crazy bastard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He sure is. Oh, also.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu&rsquo;s voice was still calm.</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know whether it will be the sealed god or the sculptures, but... It looks like the White Star is planning on barging into Puzzle City to cast some kind of summoning ritual.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale started to speak immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;That crazy trash-like son of a bitch. I guess he wants to get fucked up.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I couldn't have said it better myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Clench.</p><p>Cale clenched Alberu&rsquo;s mane.</p><p>Puzzle City.</p><p>That was a part of the Roan Kingdom.</p><p>It was extremely close to the Henituse territory in the Roan Kingdom's northeastern region.</p><p>Cale started to recall the memories associated with that location.</p><p>The city of rock towers disowned by the gods.</p><p>A city that made rock towers not for the gods but for themselves.</p><p>The place where Cale got his Vitality of the Heart ancient power and first met Taylor and Cage.</p><p>The White Star was planning on barging into that place?</p><p>He would need more details to understand all of what was going on, however...</p><p>For now...</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take care of this quickly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu started to move even faster.</p><p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p><p>There were explosions still blasting all around them.</p><p>That, plus the sounds of the dirt pillars breaking, made it difficult for the yellow head to move.</p><p>Cale was the person who was moving closest to the yellow head.</p><p>&ldquo;Cale.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, your highness?&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu and Cale were casually chatting even though they were charging forward and getting close to the enemy.</p><p>&ldquo;I might wake up in the middle. I told priestess Cage to wake me up if there was an emergency.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did she say she would wake you up?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...She said she wouldn&rsquo;t make me bleed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then it should be fine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p><p>Both of their gazes were cold, unlike their peaceful conversation.</p><p>"Ah, Cale. We also informed the Henituse Duchy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...What did you tell them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I just told them an appropriate amount.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale nodded his head.</p><p>Alberu would have known what was appropriate to tell them.</p><p>Cale trusted Alberu.</p><p>Of course, the fact that the Henituse Duchy was placed in a state of emergency with Duchess Violan at the center after hearing Alberu&rsquo;s message...</p><p>And the fact that Duke Deruth Henituse was busy summoning the nobles for a meeting to rally them together...</p><p>Cale had no idea about anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah. I also informed our allied kingdoms with a short but thorough explanation of the situation because the White Star might be coming to the Western continent.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale nodded his head.</p><p>That was something they had to do.</p><p>Having even one more person helping them out would be beneficial.</p><p>&ldquo;I left Miss Rosalyn to take care of the details since I didn't have time to plan before coming here. I thought Miss Rosalyn would do a great job of explaining things to them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Miss Rosalyn would indeed do a great job.&rdquo;</p><p>Rosalyn was perfect for the job to deal with the representatives of each kingdom since she was originally a princess and would become the future Tower Master of the Magic Tower.</p><p>It also helped that Rosalyn knew the situations in each Kingdom very well.</p><p>&ldquo;That's right. Eruhaben-nim and Sheritt-nim are by her side as well. They will help Miss Rosalyn with whatever she needs.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an even more reliable group.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu and Cale both smiled.</p><p>It was because they were thinking about their trustworthy friends.</p><hr><p>At that moment.</p><p>Rosalyn was quietly looking at the representatives of each kingdom who were visible through multiple video communication devices in front of her.</p><p>Most of their allied kingdoms other than the Mogoru Kingdom that was busy with other issues were participating in this video call.</p><p>Eruhaben and Sheritt were standing behind her covered in robes while looking like mages who were guarding her.</p><ul><li>...That-</li></ul><p>On one of the video screens... Litana, the Queen of the Jungle, was speaking as if she couldn't believe what she had heard.</p><ul><li>That, is that true about young master Cale?</li></ul><p>Rosalyn slowly nodded her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, your majesty. It is the truth.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Ho.</li></ul><p>Crown prince Valentino was shaking his head in disbelief.</p><ul><li>Hahahaha! My friend, my friend is truly! Amazing!</li></ul><p>Commander Toonka of the Whipper Kingdom was banging on his desk and laughing out loud. But he was frowning at the same time.</p><p>It looked as if he was having a hard time holding in his anger.</p><p>They heard quiet laughter at that moment.</p><p>Rosalyn turned toward the screen with the person who had laughed.</p><p>It was a man with white hair and green eyes.</p><p>Guardian Knight Clopeh who was here as the representative of the Northern Kingdoms on the Western continent was smiling as he continued to speak.</p><ul><li>As expected of Commander Cale Henituse.</li></ul><p>His hands that were clasped together were slightly shaking.</p><p>Clopeh's eyes were sparkling quite a bit as well.</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s wonderful enough that he rejected the opportunity given by the sealed god unlike the White Star and is currently dealing with a god&rsquo;s test to bring peace to this land, but... He was almost ruthlessly killed by the White Star?</li></ul><p>Queen Litana held back a groan and clenched her eyes shut.</p><p>She had heard bits and pieces about Cale&rsquo;s condition while working with the Roan Kingdom.</p><p>But to hear that he had almost been killed while he was defenseless and that his friends had rushed over to save him...</p><p>&rsquo;...Something like this......&rsquo;</p><p>Litana could not say what was on her mind.</p><p>He would have died a terrible death all alone if they had not managed to save him.</p><p>All of the representatives heard Clopeh&rsquo;s voice.</p><ul><li>He would not have been in such danger if he just went along with the will of the sealed god. There is no way for me to not admire his great conviction.</li></ul><p>His voice was calm but full of vigor.</p><ul><li>The North will participate in the Roan Kingdom's battle, no, the war for the peace of this land no matter what.</li></ul><p>Litana raised her head as if to respond to his fervent aura.</p><ul><li><p>We will be with you as well.</p></li><li><p>We will do whatever we can to help.</p></li><li><p>My friend saved us! It is our turn to save him!</p></li></ul><p>Rosalyn nodded her head after hearing the comments from all of the representatives.</p><hr><p>Alberu decided to push aside the thoughts about what he asked Rosalyn to do for now. He then looked forward and asked Cale a question.</p><p>&ldquo;Dongsaeng. What are you going to do about the currents and the water?&rdquo;</p><p>Crackle, crackle.</p><p>The yellow head was spreading currents all around it.</p><p>There was also water surrounding it as if waves were all around it.</p><p>&ldquo;Chhhhhh!&rdquo;</p><p>Electric currents and water.</p><p>Those two things made it difficult to fight the monster.</p><p>&ldquo;Tie it down of course.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You're going to charge forward?&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu was confused but continued to move forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Your highness, I was able to use one of my ancient powers at full power while you were gone.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale calmly responded while explaining what had happened while Alberu was gone.</p><p>&ldquo;That bastard&rsquo;s ability is not strong enough to defeat my ancient power at full power.&rdquo;</p><p>He knew that that was the case because his trees had been able to tie the yellow head down even when he had been in a terrible condition.</p><p>That power was the Indestructible Shield.</p><p>Paaaaat-</p><p>Silver half-transparent wings surrounded Alberu and Cale.</p><p>The silver shield appeared in front of Alberu.</p><p>&ldquo;That bastard&rsquo;s powers are not strong enough to break through my shield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I guess I just need to keep charging forward then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, sir. And...&rdquo;</p><p>Cale calmly continued to speak.</p><p>Charge forward. And after that...</p><p>"We just need to take its life.&rdquo;</p> <a href="./chapter618.html" class="chapter-nav">
