<p>&ldquo;Min Ah, should we go down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah who heard Bae Puh Rum's question was staring at Cale with a piercing gaze before she responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we are going down, how can we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum nodded his head while looking south with a concerned gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it. I hate snakes.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...The problem is that it is a snake-headed human.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This monster that had the head of a snake but the body of a giant that could be seen in mythologies was approaching them.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah looked at the other monster next to it while calmly speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...And the other has a head of a bird but the body of a snake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two monsters were slowly approaching. They seemed to be enjoying a nice walk.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum pulled at his hair as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...What the hell do they want? Why did these monsters appear?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It just means it&rsquo;s a terrible crisis.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Exactly! I'm scared of reptiles...&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;But isn't it doable since they&rsquo;re both just half and half?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Min Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah looked away from Bae Puh Rum who sounded as if he wanted to cry.</p>
<p>She knew Bae Puh Rum was a punk who acted this way on purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, let&rsquo;s go do-&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah flinched as she was about to say that they should go down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s taking you so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale was gently stepping on the ledge and walked onto the roof.</p>
<p>Swoooooooosh-</p>
<p>A light breeze was surrounding him like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>"Are you not coming down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale sounded as if he was saying they were walking to the convenience store just outside or something.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae walked forward at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Kim Rok Soo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale turned toward Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>"I want to go next.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...I guess you're getting antsy?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae had his gun in his hand and looked extremely heated to fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Cale sternly shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This monster matches well with the Kim Min Ah-Bae Puh Rum pairing.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae started to frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can these children be useful? It&rsquo;s better for me to go first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale reinterpreted Park Jin Tae's words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you saying children should stay back because it is dangerous while adults like you should fight, Mr. Park Jin Tae?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...What are you talking about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae instantly started to frown and looked away from Cale.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae then heard Kim Min Ah's voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey mister, I'm stronger than you.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked toward Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah took out a hair tie and tied her straight hair into a ponytail as she continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you fighting earlier, mister. I'm better than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum scratched his head and walked in between Park Jin Tae and Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem, umm, hyung-nim? Min Ah, Min Joon-hyung, and I have survived with just the three of us. That should be all I need to say, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae started to smile after seeing Bae Puh Rum speak awkwardly but confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pretended to be a fool on purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum awkwardly smiled in response. Kim Min Ah smacked Bae Puh Rum's back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You're going down together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah looked to one side.</p>
<p>Choi Han had put his hand on the decently healed Kim Min Joon's shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took care of the urgent parts. We can check on him later to make sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandma Kim removed her hand from Kim Min Joon&rsquo;s injury with a tired face.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>The infected wound that had been covered in pus and blood still had left a scar, but it looked much better.</p>
<p>Her healing ability was shocking.</p>
<p>This was the reason Park Jin Tae and the others all listened to Grandma Kim even as they expanded their level of influence in the central shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, grandma.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;No need to thank me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandma Kim shook her head at Cale and reached her hand out toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale took a step back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...You too-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a bruise.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;On the corner of your mouth-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;That is an internal injury.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;......Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly wiped away the dried blood by his mouth.</p>
<p>Grandma Kim looked at him with a concerned expression before stepping back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandma.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, Jin Joo. Seung Won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Jin Joo and Lee Seung Won helped to support Grandma Kim.</p>
<p>Cale approached the siblings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Seung Won.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You come down too.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale then looked toward Kim Min Joon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kim Min Joon?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had heard about most of the situation while Bae Puh Rum carried him over. He had seen Kim Rok Soo take care of two Grade 1 monsters in less than thirty minutes while he was being healed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re able to use your ability, correct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum stepped forward after hearing Cale's question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me. Hyung-nim should probably-&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kim Min Ah grabbed his arm. Bae Puh Rum could see the cold look in Kim Min Ah's face.</p>
<p>She calmly started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oppa&rsquo;s ability is not related to the injury at all. Also...&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked around the roof.</p>
<p>She could see the two approaching monsters and everybody looking at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it makes sense to try to get some rest in this situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah and Kim Min Joon made eye contact.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s an urgent situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked toward Kim Min Joon.</p>
<p>&rsquo;A military uniform.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Although the clothes were a mess, he could tell it was a uniform. Even his shoes were military boots.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon reached his hand out toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon had seen Choi Han&rsquo;s sword art that had destroyed the Grade 3 monsters while on the other building with Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you please help me?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han put Kim Min Joon on his back.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Kim Min Joon and Lee Seung Won while starting to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kim Min Joon and Mr. Lee Seung Won will move together during this battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale continued to speak as Kim Min Joon looked toward Lee Seung Won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lee Seung Won&rsquo;s ability is recording...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon&rsquo;s eyes clouded over at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...And Mr. Kim Min Joon's ability is message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale pointed to his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Voice delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won and Lee Jin Joo looked toward Kim Min Joon.</p>
<p>Cale quietly watched the three people looking at each other before turning around.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The snake-headed giant's club struck down on the ground.</p>
<p>The two monsters that were slowly approaching had gotten close.</p>
<p>The two monsters stepped on the burnt corpses of the monsters from earlier.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>The corpses of the two monsters they had feared until now crumbled and turned into ashes.</p>
<p>People gulped while watching that before looking toward Cale.</p>
<p>Cale then patted someone's shoulder as he walked back to the ledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please come down and wait with Lee Chul Min. You are up next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swoooooooosh-</p>
<p>He then headed down while being surrounded by the wind once again.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum followed behind him while carrying Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Lee Chul Min!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, leader-nim!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min hesitated after hearing Park Jin Tae's order but followed behind him as if he had no choice.</p>
<p>Of course, Choi Han, Kim Min Joon, and Lee Seung Won were already going down the stairs.</p>
<p>Cale, Bae Puh Rum, and Kim Min Ah were already on the ground.</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum became tense as soon as he saw the snake-headed monster and the snake-bodied monster getting closer.</p>
<p>&rsquo;They really are different.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Unlike when he faced off against other monsters, just looking at these monsters made him fearful.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Can I win against that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum quickly started to think. He then looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Mm!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made eye contact with Cale who was looking at him.</p>
<p>Pfft. </p>
<p>Cale chuckled while looking at Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>Cale was having this thought while looking at Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s interesting seeing him this naive too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>He was a government worker in the newly created Korean Seoul Central Shelter &rsquo;Ga&rsquo; Precinct.</p>
<p>Cale recalled what Kim Min Ah had told him in the past.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Bae Puh Rum? He's on paternity leave right now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Unlike the past where mayors and aldermen were elected, a new system of government officials was created after the cataclysms with the central shelters at the core.</p>
<p>Each precinct appointed a leader who was in charge of the administration.</p>
<p>Each leader of the central shelter was called the &rsquo;Precinct Leader.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umm, what do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale put his hand on Bae Puh Rum who was cautiously asking him a question.</p>
<p>&rsquo;They said he&rsquo;d be at the Precinct Leader level in ten years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale remembered that Bae Puh Rum was in charge of the Seoul Central Shelter &rsquo;Ga&rsquo; Precinct's region defense as a section chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Something about bringing in the wind.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>People had said that Bae Puh Rum controlled the wind as he moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bae Puh Rum.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You use the wind to fly in the sky, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum flinched at Cale&rsquo;s question before awkwardly responding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Have you not thought about using the wind in a different way?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I did, but it didn&rsquo;t work too well. Haha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat. Pat.</p>
<p>Cale patted Bae Puh Rum's shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then watch what I do and try to do the same thing.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum asked back, but Cale didn&rsquo;t pay him any attention.</p>
<p>Instead, he turned toward Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah was observing the Grade 1 monsters with a sharp gaze. She seemed to be inspecting them.</p>
<p>Cale stood next to her as he started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your ability to its maximum level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah's shoulders started to shake.</p>
<p>She was still looking at the monsters as she started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...But I can&rsquo;t control it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corners of Cale&rsquo;s lips started to go up.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah could not control her ability at this time.</p>
<p>She didn't know how to use it properly either.</p>
<p>That was why she could not fend off a single monster properly.</p>
<p>There was a requirement to be in charge of an attack team in the vanguard at the company where Kim Rok Soo was a team leader.</p>
<p>A Grade 1 Ability user specialized in attacking.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah easily met that requirement.</p>
<p>Cale quietly continued to speak to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will control it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>Cale looked into her shaking pupils and continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All you need to do is use your ability as much as you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her shaking pupils calmed down.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah quietly nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll give it a try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>"W, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min&rsquo;s eyes opened wide as he was about to walk out of the building through a window on the second floor.</p>
<p>He was looking at Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The ground shook at that moment.</p>
<p>It was not because of the monsters&rsquo; footsteps.</p>
<p>A huge half-transparent spear had struck down on the ground.</p>
<p>There was a person holding onto that spear.</p>
<p>It was Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>She was easily grabbing this spear that was three-times her height.</p>
<p>"Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min gasped in astonishment.</p>
<p>However, he couldn't say anything after seeing what happened next.</p>
<p>All he could do was stand there with his jaw dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Crazy bastard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae couldn&rsquo;t help but swear.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah looked to her side.</p>
<p>Her pupils started to shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just-&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah couldn&rsquo;t help but ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could see Cale in front of her.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Another large spear struck down on the ground and caused the dust to rise.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>Water was swirling to create a large spear.</p>
<p>The spear was pointing its sharp blade toward the sky as if it was going to pierce the sky.</p>
<p>A portion of the Sky Eating Water's power was being activated in Cale&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&rsquo;It really is weak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale could once again feel that only a portion of the ancient powers had been absorbed by his soul.</p>
<p>But he was not disappointed that it was weaker than usual.</p>
<p>The method the ancient powers gave him to make them stronger...</p>
<p>&rsquo;Gobble up our existences. Each time one of these voices disappears... You'll become stronger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale had rejected that method.</p>
<p>That was why he could feel the wills of the owners of the ancient powers and he could always be with them.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I'm sure they&rsquo;ll throw a fit when I go back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale thought about how the Super Rock and the other owners of the ancient powers would be concerned about him once he returned to his original world.</p>
<p>Pfft.</p>
<p>Cale chuckled as he grabbed the spear.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The water covered his hand and then pointed at the enemies instead of the sky.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah was blankly staring at him.</p>
<p>She made eye contact with Cale at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale kicked off the ground and said one more thing.</p>
<p>"This is attribute tutoring, so watch carefully and do what I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the second lesson.</p> <a href="./chapter566.html" class="chapter-nav">
