<p>At the central shelter closest to the one Cale was at...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung who was taking on the role of supporter at this location was frowning with both of his hands shaking.</p>
<p>The tree trunks coming out of his hands were tightly binding a large iron door.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>But the iron door looked ready to break at any moment from the banging.</p>
<p>No, it was already starting to break.</p>
<p>The door had dents here and there and it was starting to bend, slowly causing gaps to appear on the sides.</p>
<p>And beyond the iron door...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kihehehe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard the laughter of an animal that resembled a monkey.</p>
<p>The banging on the iron door became louder every time it laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started to frown.</p>
<p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s toying with us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The monster was toying with the people who were hiding inside and doing everything they could to resist.</p>
<p>But that was slowly coming to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyung-nim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho, the &rsquo;General&rsquo; at this central shelter, clenched his hand that was holding a piece of paper after hearing Jae Ha-Jung's desperate voice.</p>
<p>It was the information that Park Jin Tae, the leader of the nearby central shelter, had brought him last night.</p>
<p>He had thought that the fearless Park Jin Tae had finally gone crazy after hearing that it was information from one of his shelter&rsquo;s ability users with the power of foresight.</p>
<p>But everything on that paper was true.</p>
<p>The monsters appeared along with the solar eclipse. The weaker Grade 3 monsters came charging in first.</p>
<p>Then, seven taster monsters appeared.</p>
<p>This extremely accurate foresight gave him the chills, but this information allowed them to last until now.</p>
<p>...Yes, until now.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t look as if they could last any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Huff, huff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were injured people groaning in pain behind Bae Cheol-Ho.</p>
<p>And in front of him...</p>
<p>Beyond the breaking iron door...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kihehehe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could hear the red monkey monster&rsquo;s laugh as the other monsters started to approach.</p>
<p>He could see the Grade 2 monsters getting closer through the only crack on the boarded windows that they had purposely left in order to be able to look out.</p>
<p>The other Grade 1 taster monsters that had been leisurely enjoying the situation from the rear were approaching as well.</p>
<p>This all started to happen once the Steel Feather Hawk disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyung-nim!&rdquo;<br>
"General-nim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho could hear people shouting for him from multiple directions.</p>
<p>The veins on the hand clenching the paper looked ready to burst, but he was just looking at the iron door that was on the brink of breaking with a stoic expression.</p>
<p>But he could not do that any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyung-nim! I can't hold on any longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung shouted toward Bae Cheol-Ho while looking as if he was going to cry.</p>
<p>His shaking hands and sweat-drenched body were telling them that he had reached his limits.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho grabbed his weapon again.</p>
<p>If it was difficult to last inside the building, he needed to at least head outside and lure the monsters away.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Jae Ha-Jung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung started to frown as if he knew what was about to happen.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho and Jae Ha-Jung started to speak at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can sto-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hyung-nim, I will do what I can to hold on a little loon-&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>{Starting now.}</p>
<p>Everybody inside the building shut up.</p>
<p>It was that voice.</p>
<p>They could not forget the voice that they heard during the solar eclipse. It was the voice that had been providing them with information every hour.</p>
<p>{We will now send the first round of reinforcements.}</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung and Bae Cheol-Ho looked toward each other.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho clenched his fists again.</p>
<p>{Please hold on a little longer.}</p>
<p>The woman continued to speak.</p>
<p>{The first round of reinforcements will take care of all taster monsters.}</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho released his clenched fists.</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung started to mumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...What? Is that even possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Taking care of all taster monsters? How was that possible?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Everybody had those thoughts.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho&rsquo;s voice echoed inside the building at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hold on a little longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone with an arm injury started to shout toward Bae Cheol-Ho.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General! There&rsquo;s no way that is true-!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;No matter what, it means that someone is coming to help us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person speaking to Bae Cheol-Ho shut his mouth.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho looked around.</p>
<p>&rsquo;We already gave up on running away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some people had tried to give up on the central shelter and run away when the Grade 3 monsters came to attack, but most of them had stayed in the building.</p>
<p>It was because they knew it was hell outside as well.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho had also convinced them with the information in his hand.</p>
<p>&rsquo;We can only keep holding on here even if we end up dying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They needed to last just one night.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho made up his mind.</p>
<p>He then walked over to Jae Ha-Jung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jae Ha-Jung! Please keep it up for a little longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho then moved his hands toward the iron door that was barely being maintained by the tree trunks rather than to his weapon.</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung started to frown while watching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Fuck! I have no choice but to keep it up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put more strength into his shaking hands with an annoyed expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sigh.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hey, let's go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other people were shaking their heads but still walked over to the iron door and pushed against it with their hands.</p>
<p>These were the people who were not severely injured.</p>
<p>The other people started to quickly move as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Go bring that couch and put it by the door!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ask the people on the second floor! See if they have anything else to throw outside! What is up with the kid making the flaming bottles?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s out right now from lack of strength!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Haah, shit! Throw whatever we can! We need to prevent as many monsters from getting near here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But those noises stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kihehe! Hehe! Kihehehe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was because the monster&rsquo;s laughing started to become louder.</p>
<p>But they quickly snapped out of it.</p>
<p>It was because of the voice echoing in their minds.</p>
<p>&rsquo;We will now send the first round of reinforcements.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It should get at least a little better than now if they could hold on for just a bit longer.</p>
<p>That thought was starting to take hold in people's minds.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t have much time.</p>
<p>As they started to think about how much time must have passed since they heard the voice...</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung could feel his legs slowly starting to lose strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to grumble anymore.</p>
<p>All he could do was groan.</p>
<p>Someone who watched him struggle asked Bae Cheol-Ho a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you think they&rsquo;ll get here? Hopefully they get here quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho could not respond to that question. It could not be helped.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...It&rsquo;ll take them a while.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was thinking about the distance between Park Jin Tae's central shelter and this central shelter.</p>
<p>They were pretty close in comparison to most central shelters, but it was still quite the distance.</p>
<p>&rsquo;It's not just the distance we have to worry about right now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had to get past the monster obstacles to get here.</p>
<p>They said to hold on a little longer, but Bae Cheol-Ho was certain that it would be a long time.</p>
<p>&rsquo;And if the sun goes down during that time-&rsquo;</p>
<p>Forget it passing 5 pm as they fought against the monsters to get here, if the sun went down...</p>
<p>&rsquo;...They might not come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho was thinking about the worst possible scenario.</p>
<p>It was his job to do that.</p>
<p>This was the only thing he could say to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...They will get here if we keep holding on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His job was to give them at least a small amount of hope.</p>
<p>But his mind was full of concern about how to get past this difficult situation, as he could not just irresponsibly give them false hope.</p>
<p>&rsquo;At least the information Park Jin Tae gave us is reliable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That information had not lied.</p>
<p>That was why it was the thing he could trust the most right now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyu, hyung-nim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho then heard the person who was looking out the crack in the window on his behalf shouting in shock.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Are they already here?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho urgently looked toward the person thinking that the reinforcements had arrived.</p>
<p>"General-nim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A scout who was on a higher floor ran down the stairs in shock as he called out to Bae Cheol-Ho.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho then saw the person who had called him from the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho let out a gasp.</p>
<p>What he saw on the person's face was despair and not joy.</p>
<p>They all then heard the scout who was coming down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T, there&rsquo;s another monster that appeared in the sky! It seems to be a Grade 1 monster based on its size!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of their faces filled with despair.</p>
<p>They had been toyed with by the Steel Feather Hawk that was 1.5 times stronger than the other Grade 1 monsters until now.</p>
<p>&rsquo;There&rsquo;s nobody worth chatting with here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk that had toyed with them left after saying that.</p>
<p>The remaining Grade 1 monsters started to run wild after that and the Grade 2 monsters started charging forward.</p>
<p>But another flying monster in such a situation?!</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t help but become filled with despair.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...That's not possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information said that only seven Grade 1 monsters would appear right now.</p>
<p>But there was another one?</p>
<p>Was this information wrong?</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho&rsquo;s mind started to go blank.</p>
<p>The person looking out the window continued to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>"T, the monster is heading down! I, it seems to be heading toward us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was shaking.</p>
<p>It was full of fear. That fear quickly spread to everybody inside the central shelter.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho started to frown after realizing this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho moved his hands away from supporting the door and urgently ran toward the crack in the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyung-nim, over there-&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person at the window pointed in a direction for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho let out a gasp.</p>
<p>His gasp put even more fear on the faces of the others inside the building.</p>
<p>The person next to Bae Cheol-Ho continued to shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, it is descending extremely quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The extremely large monster was descending extremely quickly as he mentioned. It looked as if it wanted to destroy this building.</p>
<p>The person whispered quietly so that only Bae Cheol-Ho could hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyung-nim, should we run away? We can&rsquo;t last-&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho looked up at the sky before barely managing to open his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We will start with the people in the rear.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir. We will move the old and the weak firs-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person had to stop talking after hearing Bae Cheol-Ho shout.</p>
<p>He looked toward Bae Cheol-Ho in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyung-nim?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho moved his face closer to the window instead of looking at the other person.</p>
<p>His gaze was focused on the monster that was descending faster and faster.</p>
<p>He then said a single question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...A person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence filled the building again.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho started to mumble in disbelief through the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...There's a person on top of the monster&rsquo;s back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the hell was going on?</p>
<p>Even Jae Ha-Jung looked toward Bae Cheol-Ho in shock.</p>
<p>He then saw and heard something.</p>
<p>He saw that Bae Cheol-Ho's eyes that had been full of despair and disappointment slowly focus again while his voice no longer sounded weak.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In addition to the monster...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>But he could now see the people who had originally been covered by the monster&rsquo;s large body.</p>
<p>There was one person on the monster's back.</p>
<p>Then there were some more people descending behind the monster.</p>
<p>His instinct was telling him something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the reinforcements!&rdquo;</p>
<p>People heard a loud groan as soon as he shouted.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung groaned and fell on his knees at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dodge!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Grab Ha-Jung and retreat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people who were supporting the iron door grabbed Jae Ha-Jung and moved back.</p>
<p>The tree trunks started to break...</p>
<p>And a large hole appeared on the iron door that could not hold out any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kihehe! Kihehehe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red monkey monster outside the hole was laughing while looking at them.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>The iron door with the large hole slowly started to crumble.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The iron door fell and there was nothing left to protect them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung&rsquo;s eyes became blurry as he watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kihehe! Hehehe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red monkey took a step into the building.</p>
<p>The monkey with red fur and red eyes looked excited. It seemed excited at the fact that it could now kill these people.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I worked my ass off to hold on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung bit down on his lips and it started to bleed.</p>
<p>&rsquo;No. It couldn't continue like this. This couldn't be it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His shaking lips opened as he started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N, no-&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kihehe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monkey looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>Boooom!</p>
<p>The people inside could hear a loud noise as a shadow covered the iron door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kihehe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monkey slowly turned its head after seeing a shadow cover its body.</p>
<p>And then it saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grrrrrrrrr!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Grrrrrrr!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Screeeeeeech!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Grade 2 monsters were quickly retreating.</p>
<p>They seemed to be in a hurry.</p>
<p>However, the red monkey could not see that properly.</p>
<p>It was the same for the people inside the central shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiiiiiiiiiii, kiiiiiiiiii-&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red monkey subconsciously started to curl up.</p>
<p>The monkey's red eyes looked toward the arrogant black eyes looking down at it.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... A tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A black tiger with a lion's mane had landed on the ground and was now looking at the red monkey and the people inside the central shelter with a nonchalant expression.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bae Cheol-Ho?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could all see a person on the tiger's neck.</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho looked toward that man as well.</p>
<p>A skinny young man started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reinforcements are here.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho let out a gasp.</p>
<p>He could see Cale who was standing there with a relaxed smile.</p>
<p>Cale patted the Dark Tiger's body with one hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyung-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak with a frown on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...There&rsquo;s no way, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t what he was thinking, was it?</p>
<p>Alberu had a small amount of hope.</p>
<p>However, Cale easily ignored that hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyung-nim.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike Alberu who responded weakly, Cale pointed toward the red monkey and shouted in a refreshing manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please bite it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu lowered his head and mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Damn it.&rdquo;</p> <a href="./chapter572.html" class="chapter-nav">
