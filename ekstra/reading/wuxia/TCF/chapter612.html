<p>His actions did not just stop with a smile.</p><p>Squeeze.</p><p>The White Star could see the chain pulling his ankle down.</p><p>&ldquo;...Ha.&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star let out a short sigh.</p><p>It was because he saw Alberu pulling the chain.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to battle against me in physical strength? ...Did you really just say that?&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his hand with a smile of disbelief.</p><p>His subordinates responded to his signal.</p><p>"Attack! Support our liege!&rdquo;</p><p>The black mages gathered together and used magic to lift some warriors and archers into the air.</p><p>The other warriors and Dark Elves set up a formation to protect the mages.</p><p>It could not be helped.</p><p>&ldquo;Protect the mages from the Molan Household and the Mercenary King!&rdquo;</p><p>Beacrox and Bud...</p><p>The swordsman holding a greatsword and the swordsman with a blue aura were both rushing toward them.</p><p>&ldquo;Be cautious of the assassin!&rdquo;</p><p>There was also the assassin who was so stealthy that they had not even seen him once. Ron Molan was coming for their lives.</p><p>The black mages, who were now protected by the warriors, started to cast attack-type magic spells.</p><p>"Attack!&rdquo;</p><p>One person shouted loudly and numerous attack spells shot up into the air.</p><p>&ldquo;Our focus is the necromancer's monsters!&rdquo;</p><p>Mary responded at that moment.</p><p>"That is an error in judgment.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment...</p><p>Sniff.</p><p>The Mercenary King took a short sniff.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, so strong.&rdquo;</p><p>As he quietly mumbled that...</p><p>Mary motioned to her skeleton wyverns.</p><p>&ldquo;This level of attack is light.&rdquo;</p><p>Black threads stretched out in the shape of music staves and her monsters started to move on top of them as if they were the notes.</p><p>They would be making up the introduction if this was actually a song.</p><p>&ldquo;It is a complete error in judgment if you believe that this is enough to defeat me.&rdquo;</p><p>Three months.</p><p>Mary was used to waiting and pain, but... It had been a very long time.</p><p>It was because her heart had been hurting.</p><p>That was why she used that time very efficiently.</p><p>These past three months were enough for her to absorb all of the dead mana she had gathered while moving around with Cale and make it hers.</p><p>&ldquo;I am strong.&rdquo;</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>One of the white wyverns&rsquo; tail split an attack spell in half.</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>Another wyvern's sharp claws blocked an archer&rsquo;s arrow and, of course, killed the archer.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>One large wyvern&rsquo;s body descended to the ground.</p><p>Its jaws that were made of bones opened to reveal its sharp fangs as Bud started to shout with joy.</p><p>"Sweep them away!&rdquo;</p><p>It happened exactly as he had said.</p><p>The skeleton wyvern headed toward the enemies following the black thread, following the will of its master.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooooooar!&rdquo;<br>"Dodge it! Protect the mages!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fuck, there are more coming down!&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star's subordinates looked up after hearing that shout.</p><p>The sky was getting brighter as night was ending and morning was coming.</p><p>It looked as if there were black stars falling to the ground.</p><p>There were not too many of them.</p><p>The problem was that they were not stars... They were ugly and fearsome skeleton monsters. In addition, they were all huge.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Once another monster descended on the ground...</p><p>&ldquo;I'm going first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p><p>Beacrox rushed past Bud and got on top of a wyvern.</p><p>His greatsword then started to swing nonstop on top of the skeleton wyvern that was causing a ruckus.</p><p>&ldquo;Such a cool idea......!&rdquo;</p><p>Bud gasped at seeing Beacrox&rsquo;s hardcore actions before jumping on top of a skeleton wyvern as well, making it twice as chaotic.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha, haha-!&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star started to laugh while looking down at what was going on. He was laughing in disbelief.</p><p>He looked toward Mary and started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;You prepared quite a lot of skeleton monsters.&rdquo;</p><p>Swish.</p><p>Mary turned her head toward the White Star and responded in a GPS-like voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to pay any attention to someone like you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>As the White Star started to frown...</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I'm here.&rdquo;</p><p>Chhhhhhh-!</p><p>Alberu pulled the spear and the chain with both hands.</p><p>The White Star&rsquo;s body staggered and he started to move downward.</p><p>&ldquo;You wish to go up against me in a battle of physical strength?&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star&rsquo;s gaze changed.</p><p>&ldquo;How laughable.&rdquo;</p><p>Chhhhhhhhh!</p><p>The White Star grabbed the white chain around his ankle.</p><p>He then pulled.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu&rsquo;s eyes instantly opened wide at his opponent&rsquo;s strength that he could feel through the chain.</p><p>The chain was extremely taut and not moving in either direction.</p><p>Alberu looked out through his helmet and made eye contact with the White Star.</p><p>The White Star started to speak at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I am removing the restriction.&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star pulled on the chain once again after saying that.</p><p>&ldquo;How-?!&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;How could he be so strong?!&rsquo;</p><p>The taut chain started to move toward the White Star as Alberu felt as if he was being swept by a large wave.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu could feel his body being lifted up into the air.</p><p>&rsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there would be such a huge difference in strength!&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu couldn't do anything once the White Star started to use his true strength.</p><ul><li>Oh my.</li></ul><p>Taerang started to quietly speak as if it was mumbling.</p><ul><li>It seems as if using the chains to fight was a mistake, sir. Alberu Crossman-nim, you are weak.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p><p>As Alberu started to frown...</p><p>The White Star started to swing the chain with a stoic expression.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you should get some air.&rdquo;</p><p>The chain floated up into the air and made a large arc.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu's body followed the chain through the arc and the sinkhole&rsquo;s wall was at the end of the arc.</p><p>Although it was called a wall, it was where the homes of the Endable Kingdom&rsquo;s residents were located.</p><p>&rsquo;I'm going to crash into those buildings at this rate!&rsquo;</p><p>It looked like an obvious conclusion for Alberu to crash into those buildings since he could not let go of his spear.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, withdraw!&rdquo;</p><p>Chhhhhhh-</p><p>The White Star could see the chain in his hands instantly get smaller and escape his grip as soon as Alberu shouted.</p><p>The White Star laughed and turned his head after seeing that.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re next.&rdquo;</p><p>He then started to head toward Mary.</p><p>The White Star was moving much quicker than earlier as he approached her.</p><p>Crackle-</p><p>The sword in his hand was crackling like magma, looking much more dangerous than earlier, as if it would destroy anything it touched.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much better now.&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star said that before stabbing his sword toward Mary&rsquo;s net.</p><p>Red fire shot out of the tip of the sword.</p><p>&ldquo;...This.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary&rsquo;s expression stiffened.</p><p>Her net would reach the black orb soon. A red arrow that was much stronger than the fire boomerang from earlier was headed toward her.</p><p>No.</p><p>It was too big to be considered an arrow.</p><p>It felt as if a large snake monster was approaching her.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finally stopping.&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star smiled at the stiff Mary who had stopped moving.</p><p>But he then started to frown.</p><p>&ldquo;You motherfucking old ass Dragon!&rdquo;</p><p>Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p><p>In front of Mary...</p><p>Gold dust was starting to gather in front of Mary.</p><p>That gold light...</p><p>It symbolized the appearance of a Dragon.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am that motherfucking Dragon.&rdquo;</p><p>A gold shield appeared in front of the fire arrow.</p><p>Baaaaang---!</p><p>The fire arrow exploded along with a loud noise. The fire spread out around the gold shield and started to make it crack, but it could not get past the shield.</p><p>Eruhaben appeared once the shield disappeared.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re attacking again immediately?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head while looking at the White Star who was rushing through the explosion toward him.</p><p>Eruhaben looked as if he was fooling around, but his gaze was serious.</p><p>&rsquo;...I can't use my full strength.&rsquo;</p><p>Eruhaben was not using his full strength in case he needed it for an emergency.</p><p>Everybody, including Eruhaben, had to survive.</p><p>Swooooooosh-</p><p>Gold dust was surrounding his body.</p><p>Smile.</p><p>The White Star made a comment while charging toward Eruhaben.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you can't use your full strength right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Clang.</p><p>The tip of his fire sword pointed at Eruhaben.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s time for you to die?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I always wonder whether today or tomorrow might be my last.&rdquo;</p><p>The two of them were lightly chatting with each other but the powers surrounding them were getting much stronger.</p><p>The White Star's fire sword was so strong now that just pointing forward was making the air around it fluctuate.</p><p>The White Star had a thick smile on his face as he raised his sword.</p><p>He would soon kill this old Dragon.</p><p>&rsquo;Good.&rsquo;</p><p>He could use this bastard as a sacrifice as well.</p><p>Crackle-</p><p>The fire that was now turning from red to black shot up into the air.</p><p>That fire would soon head toward Eruhaben.</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>Tang-!</p><p>The White Star heard an unfamiliar sound behind his back.</p><p>It was a quiet sound.</p><p>He would normally ignore such a thing.</p><p>&rsquo;...I don&rsquo;t feel any mana or aura!&rsquo;</p><p>But the sound was too unfamiliar.</p><p>He could also hear something cutting through the wind.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star ended up turning around and swinging the sword toward the direction of the noise.</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>Something slammed into the sword and exploded once it touched the fire.</p><p>The White Star lowered his sword.</p><p>He could see another black skeleton wyvern.</p><p>And on top of that wyvern...</p><p>&ldquo;You need to watch an attack to its end.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu had said that while smiling.</p><p>And in his hand...</p><p>"What is that?&rdquo;</p><p>Was a weapon that the White Star had never seen before.</p><p>Although it couldn&rsquo;t create all of the weapons from this world, but if it was from the other side... The Unbreakable Spear could create any weapon from Earth 3.</p><p>Alberu didn't know about all of the different types of weapons on Earth 3.</p><p>However, there had been quite a lot of weapons he saw in Cale&rsquo;s Earth as the Dark Tiger.</p><p>There was one weapon that was new to him that he liked quite a lot.</p><p>Click. Click.</p><p>The white spear looked different now.</p><p>It was much shorter and there was a hole where the spearhead should have been.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to know what this is?&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu asked before his position resembled a certain someone's.</p><ul><li>The Omnipotent Spear's ability is automatically correcting your position while using a weapon for the first time.</li></ul><p>The corrected position is better than average, but it is not exceptional.</p><p>Alberu&rsquo;s position automatically started to correct itself, resembling the person Alberu thought of in his mind.</p><p>What is this?</p><p>&ldquo;Why would I tell you?&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu pulled the trigger as he said that.</p><p>Tang!</p><p>He then pulled the trigger once more as Park Jin Tae had done.</p><p>Tang!</p><p>Two white bullets started to fly toward the White Star.</p><p>If the chains won't work...</p><p>He just had to use something else.</p><p>&ldquo;I can also fight together with someone else as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu could see Eruhaben attacking the White Star at the same time he shot the bullets.</p><p>&ldquo;...Shit!&rdquo;</p><p>The White Star started to frown after being attacked from the front and back at once.</p><p>The two of their attacks?</p><p>He could easily block them using his water wall.</p><p>But that was not the issue.</p><p>The problem was what the necromancer would do while he was defending against these two bastards.</p><p>That was the issue.</p><p>That issue ended up turning into reality.</p><p>&ldquo;I got it.&rdquo;</p><p>As Mary quietly mumbled...</p><p>The net made of black threads and flying skeleton monsters reached the black orb and quickly started to surround it.</p><p>Alberu shouted as he watched.</p><p>&ldquo;Drag it up!&rdquo;</p><p>Mary&rsquo;s net caught a big fish and quickly started to shoot up into the air.</p><p>It was moving away from the White Star...</p><p>Moving away from all attacks...</p><p>It was moving the big fish, Cale Henituse, to a safe spot.</p><p>&ldquo;Eruhaben-nim!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p><p>The others who were still here would now do their best to make sure that no trash got into that net.</p><p>&ldquo;We will hold you back.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu pointed the gun at the White Star again.</p><hr><p>Crackle, crackle!</p><p>The tree trunks that were much wider than a person were crumbling left and right.</p><p>Baaaaaang-!</p><p>The ground started to split again.</p><p>A monster with blood in its eyes quickly entered the split ground to hide.</p><p>"The yellow monster is escaping!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...It looks like it is retreating for now!&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk walked over to Choi Han after hearing the shouts around him.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it retreating for now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That seems to be the case.&rdquo;</p><p>The yellow head had dug through the three trunks and escaped underground.</p><p>"But it will return soon. It will be back before the day is over.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I guess we will get a short break.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han and Lee Soo Hyuk then followed Kim Min Ah to the top of a tree nearby.</p><p>Cale was standing there.</p> <a href="./chapter611.html" class="chapter-nav">
