<p>A mountain range located on the northern part of the Eastern continent. A person who arrived at that location bent down.<br>
He then cautiously sniffed the scent of the mountain in front of him.</p>
<p>The person's numerous years of experience helped him realize something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...It smells fishy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cold air was coming down from the mountain.<br>
His intuition was telling him that something was off.<br>
He heard a calm voice next to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be covered in the scent of blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han commented before turning his head to look at the man behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale-nim, I have a bad feeling about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ron who had smelled the scent of blood stood up straight and reported to Cale.<br>
Cale quietly observed the two of them before quietly asking Beacrox a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beacrox, did you smell the scent of blood too?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Young master-nim, do you really think they could smell blood even though the mountain is so tall and wide? It is just intuition. Intuition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beacrox responded with a stoic expression before turning away from Cale. Cale thought this was very fitting of Beacrox's personality as he started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bottom of the mountain.<br>
Originally, mage Glenn Poeff and the mercenaries he brought with him should have been stationed here waiting for Bud to contact them.</p>
<p>However, there was nobody here.<br>
All they could see were traces of people who were waiting here before rushing up the mountain.</p>
<p>He recalled what Bud told him.</p>
<p>&rsquo;The entire mountain was under an illusion.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Now that the illusion is gone, the entire mountain is covered in enemies.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;...Help me.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Please quickly help me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale's gaze started to sink.<br>
The golden top's whip in his hand started to glow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to enter the mountain now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enemies had cast an illusion.<br>
That must mean that there was an illusionist here as well.<br>
Furthermore, that illusion was supposedly destroyed.<br>
He was tired of illusions now.</p>
<p>There were also so many enemies that they could cover the entire mountain.<br>
The Mercenary King's mercenaries and the Elves Cale gathered numbered in the hundreds, but the Mercenary King seemed to have determined that the enemies overwhelmingly outnumbered them.</p>
<p>Bud was probably right.<br>
He was the Mercenary King who had experienced many battlefields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...That is why we can't just go up without a plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mountain was so high that the peak was covered in snow.<br>
This was the largest mountain in the mountain range that blocked the cold air from the north from reaching south, so, it was naturally tall and wide.</p>
<p>That was why they could not just go up as is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Molan household&rsquo;s assassins were quietly standing like shadows behind Ron and Beacrox.<br>
This group of assassins was half of the assassins who had infiltrated the Molden palace earlier. They had urgently rushed over along with Ron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our preparations to infiltrate the mountain are completed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ron had expressed it as an infiltration not to a castle or a residence, but to a mountain.<br>
It might seem as if he used the wrong word, however, it was accurate.<br>
Cale opened his mouth to call someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had someone who could trick people and hide their presence using a different method than illusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meeeeeow-!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and Hong stopped rubbing their bodies on Cale&rsquo;s legs and looked up at him. White smoke started to surround On before spreading out.<br>
She seemed to have understood Cale&rsquo;s intentions as she had prepared to use her fog in advance.<br>
Cale had asked Raon to quickly bring On and Hong over.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human, are we going in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Cale took a step toward the mountain.</p>
<p>"We are infiltrating the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quiet at the foot of the mountain, but they might hear weapons clashing or people screaming once they entered.<br>
Furthermore, the chances of those screams belonging to their allies were high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our first goal is to reinforce our allies and save them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale entered into the forest.<br>
The shadows of the trees made the forest dark even though it was day time.</p>
<p>It was an urgent situation right now.<br>
That was why Cale gave an order that was different than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our second goal... Is to get rid of the enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gazes on the faces of the assassins of the Molan household quickly changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our third goal is to identify the enemies, however, if that may lead to injuries... Then we will immediately escape or focus on our second goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the first and second goals were focused on saving as many of their allies as possible.<br>
Ron walked over toward Cale without making any noise and then asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master-nim, which direction do we need to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Squeeze.</p>
<p>Cale tightened his grip.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>The top's whip in his hand was continuing to shake unlike usual.<br>
Cale heard two of the three Wind Elementals that always moved around with him. One was with the Elves in the mountains right now.</p>
<p>&rsquo;C, chaos, destruction, anger! Elementals are screaming all over the mountain!&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;I hear Elementals fighting all around the mountain! No, that&rsquo;s not it; they seem to be running away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Elementals sounded more frantic than ever before.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I can&rsquo;t hear the one we left here at all! I think it&rsquo;s in a dangerous situation too!&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;This is bad! Chaos, destruction, disorder!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Although the Elementals were frantic, Cale was calm.<br>
Of course, his heart was beating wildly as well. He was in a hurry as well.<br>
He imagined the Elves getting injured as the Wind Elementals told him that they heard Elementals screaming.</p>
<p>Cale bit down on his lips.<br>
He was currently the commander of the Elves. He could not forget about the responsibilities that came with the role.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Chaos, destruction! The screaming seems to be slowly heading toward the center of the mountain!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;This is it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s eyes started to sparkle.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Cale, The Elementals&rsquo; screams are slowly heading toward the center of the mountain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;I found it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had found the information he was looking for.</p>
<p>If the screams were slowly heading toward the center of the mountain...<br>
The meaning behind those words appeared in Cale&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>The Elementals should be with the Elves.<br>
The Mercenary King should be with the Elves as well.<br>
It meant that their allies were slowly moving toward the center of the mountain.<br>
They were moving in that direction while the Elementals are screaming.</p>
<p>&rsquo;That means that they are not moving there out of their own free will. Someone else is making them move there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were not gathering together by choice.<br>
It meant that numerous enemies were herding their allies to the center.<br>
There was only one explanation for it.<br>
Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Battue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enemies were herding their allies to one location. They were doing that to either hunt them down or with another goal in mind.<br>
That other goal was definitely not good either.</p>
<p>The air around Cale turned cold.</p>
<p>Unlike how the group's fighting spirit had gone up and heated the air around them earlier... The air was now getting colder as their fighting spirit went up.</p>
<p>The assassins&rsquo; gazes turned cold.<br>
Ron&rsquo;s gaze sunk the most.<br>
Mercenary King Bud. The Poeff household's Glenn Poeff.<br>
Ron was quite concerned about them as he had his base on the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>Battue.</p>
<p>The others realized what was going on as soon as they heard that word.<br>
Cale noticed that was the case, however, he still started to speak.</p>
<p>"Our allies and the enemies are gathering toward the center of the mountain.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Will we head over to save the allies right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beacrox asked as he was unable to be patient any longer.<br>
They all looked ready to charge forward to save their allies at any moment.<br>
However, Cale shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han quietly called out to him.<br>
Cale had a smile on his face even though this was an urgent situation. His smile looked angry.</p>
<p>The enemies were using battue on the allies.<br>
That was why he would make them realize something.</p>
<p>If the enemies were using battue... &rsquo;I'll use battue on you bastards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will strike the enemies that are gathering our allies to a single spot from the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ron's eyes clouded over.<br>
Just like how their allies were gathering to one spot...<br>
The enemies that were herding them over were gathering toward one spot as well.</p>
<p>Cale looked down.<br>
He could see On and Hong.<br>
Raon was probably nearby while remaining invisible as well.<br>
Cale did not plan on letting any more allies get hurt.</p>
<p>&rsquo;We will strike the enemies that are gathering our allies to a single spot from the back.<br>
But we will not show ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will hide behind magic, fog, and poison to stealthily strike the enemies from behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children averaging nine-years-old all responded.</p>
<p>Tata tap.</p>
<p>On kicked off the ground and climbed up a tree before looking down at Cale. Hong was next to her as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meeeeeeeeeeow!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Meeow-&rdquo;</p>
<p>That meant that they were ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human! Do not worry! We will flip everything over with the poisonous fog! We will hide grandpa Ron and all of his subordinates as well!</li>
</ul>
<p>An illusion. There were things other than illusions that could trick people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On, I leave it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silver kitten nodded her head. The calm On would lead the children averaging nine-years-old without letting them get hurt.<br>
Cale needed the children&rsquo;s help, but he was still going to make them act from the rear where it was safe.</p>
<p>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The fog surrounding On became thicker and started to spread.<br>
On and Hong became covered in fog such that they were no longer visible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human! I am hiding in the fog as well!<br>
"We're ready!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Cale heard Raon and Hong&rsquo;s voices through the fog and started to speak again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choi Han.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han stood next to Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are heading toward the center with me. Our goal is to get there before the enemies or our allies.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whirlwinds appeared at the tips of Cale&rsquo;s feet as he activated the Sound of the Wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll head there first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale started to head toward the forest with Choi Han.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ron. I'll tell you the enemies&rsquo; locations through Raon, so use that information to surround them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale was planning on sending a Wind Elemental to inform Raon about the enemies&rsquo; locations.<br>
He had informed Raon about it on their way here, so there shouldn't be any issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not worry about it. Young master-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale turned around only to see the assassins disappear into the shadow of the forest.</p>
<p>Shhhhhh-</p>
<p>All he could hear were leaves rustling.<br>
Beacrox disappeared as well and only Ron, as well as the growing fog, remained.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>The fog then covered Ron as he benignly informed Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it is time to do some shadow hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the fighting style for the assassins of the underworld.<br>
Ron started to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pfft.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Cale chuckled before turning his head and heading toward the location that the enemies were herding their allies.<br>
Of course, he still shared his sentiments about Ron's comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So vicious.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Shhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Cale and Choi Han were quickly climbing the mountain without resting.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...Cale-nim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han was about two steps behind Cale as Cale was in the front finding the path.</p>
<p>Ooooooooong-</p>
<p>The golden top's whip was vibrating as the Wind Elementals told Cale the direction of where the Elementals were screaming.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Chaos, destruction! It is the center of the mountain but slightly higher than the actual center! It is right underneath the area with the snow!&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Cale, I will go deliver that message to Raon-nim!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two Wind Elementals were more rushed than Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale who was quickly rushing past the forest was scratched by a branch and his cheek started to bleed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han who was shocked by Cale&rsquo;s quiet groan started to speak.<br>
It could not be helped.<br>
Cale looked more frantic than usual as they were heading toward where their allies were presumed to be gathering.<br>
Of course, Choi Han understood how Cale was feeling.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...1,001 people have already gone missing here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was where the Mercenaries Guild's Ranger Brigade had instantly gone missing.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Also...there were the things we saw on our way up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were moving quickly, but both Cale and Choi Han had observed their surroundings as they moved.</p>
<p>Blood.</p>
<p>They saw a lot of blood on the trees and boulders as they started to climb the mountain.<br>
Whose blood would it be?<br>
They couldn't help but speed up as they thought about that.</p>
<p>However, Choi Han had to think about Cale's health as well.<br>
Forget Cale not getting hurt, Choi Han realized that they could not let Cale become unconscious after hearing about Bud&rsquo;s situation and the Whale tribe's battle.<br>
There were a lot of battles going on right now.</p>
<p>Cale was the brain.<br>
The brain was the center of all reactions.<br>
That was why he could not get injured nor push himself too hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale-nim, aren&rsquo;t you overdoing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took two quick steps to move next to Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shhhh. </p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s arm blocked Choi Han.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale-nim! Where-?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han could see Cale stop him before starting to move in a different direction.<br>
He quickly chased behind him.</p>
<p>Shhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Cale was moving past the leaves and grass and headed somewhere other than their destination.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Chaos, destruction! I heard a weird noise!&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;It is a human-shaped life form! It's breathing is very weak!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two Wind Elementals were saying there was someone nearby.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I will go take a look! Chaos, destruction, urgent, urgent!&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the Wind Elementals headed there first and Cale increased his speed as well.</p>
<p>The allies and enemies were all headed toward one spot right now.<br>
However, there was someone who was apart from the rest.<br>
It could be the enemy, but...</p>
<p>&rsquo;They said that person is breathing weakly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Weak breathing could mean that there was an enemy hiding and holding their breath down.</p>
<p>&rsquo;They also said that they heard a weird noise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That meant the chances of it being a hiding enemy was low.<br>
It was more likely to be someone who was injured and groaning in pain.</p>
<p>That was why Cale could only consider one conclusion.</p>
<p>&rsquo;The Ranger Brigade!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It might be one of the missing 1,001 people.<br>
It could be a member of the Ranger Brigade who managed to avoid the enemies and the illusion and was hiding.<br>
The Mercenary King was unable to find this person because of the illusion, but he might be able to find this person now that the illusion was destroyed.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I need to find them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He needed to find them, especially if it was one of the Ranger Brigade members.</p>
<p>If the noise the Elementals were hearing was weak, then he needed to find the person before they died.<br>
Most importantly, he needed to find the person to hear what happened on the mountain.<br>
Only then would he be able to understand the enemy's strength.<br>
That would allow him to save the Mercenary King and the others in a safer way.</p>
<p>Cale started to use more of the Sound of the Wind because he still needed to quickly head to the Mercenary King as well.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I need to hurry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There were too many things he needed to do all at once.</p> <a href="./chapter508.html" class="chapter-nav">
