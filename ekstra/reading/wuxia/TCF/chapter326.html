<p>Choi Han started to walk toward Adin. </p>
<p>&ldquo;How could someone move so quickly?!&rdquo; </p>
<p>One of the knights could not hide his shock. </p>
<p>He could just see a black blur. <br>
A human and his sword that were both covered in black aura was charging toward Imperial Prince Adin as if he was a wild animal. <br>
The black aura continued to run wild as Choi Han moved. </p>
<p>&rsquo;His highness is a high-grade knight!&rsquo; </p>
<p>The knight felt fear as he watched Choi Han almost instantly arrive in front of Adin with his sword raised. His superior calmed him down at that moment. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be fine.&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;...Excuse me?&rdquo; </p>
<p>The two swords clashed as the knight asked back. </p>
<p>Baaaaaang! </p>
<p>A loud noise filled the area as if a mountain had crashed into another mountain. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! Cover your eyes!&rdquo; </p>
<p>The knight quickly covered his eyes at his superior&rsquo;s urging. <br>
The dust underground, the broken pieces of the ground, started to fly up from the impact. <br>
And once the dust settled down... </p>
<p>&ldquo;...My goodness, something like that is possible?&rdquo; </p>
<p>The knight even forgot that he was in the middle of a battle after seeing what was going on. </p>
<p>The black things were fighting to gobble each other up. </p>
<p>Choi Han looked at the black sword that was up against his sword. </p>
<p>It was a sword made of dead mana. Furthermore, it was surrounded by black aura smoke. </p>
<p>His sword that was surrounded by the aura of a sword master was unable to break this black sword. </p>
<p>Imperial Prince Adin started to laugh at this sight. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think? You already knew this. My black aura smoke and your black aura are at completely different levels.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Screeeeech- <br>
The two swords were up against each other while maintaining a balance. <br>
Adin started to smile more and more as that continued. It could not be helped. </p>
<p>It was because of their clash earlier and their second clash now. <br>
Choi Han showed no emotion on his face. </p>
<p>However, unlike the first time, he was not hiding his aura and letting it run wild. <br>
However, Adin could see it. He opened his mouth to speak. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't you want to eat it up?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han&rsquo;s dull eyes headed toward Adin. <br>
Adin's gaze headed toward Choi Han&rsquo;s hands. </p>
<p>The hands were slightly shaking. </p>
<p>The Imperial Prince whispered like a snake. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My black despair. Don't you want to eat it? Hmm?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adin could see Choi Han&rsquo;s gaze going blank. Choi Han&rsquo;s sword changed direction at that moment. </p>
<p>Bang! <br>
The two swords clashed again. </p>
<p>Choi Han&rsquo;s sword then headed for Adin&rsquo;s remaining left leg. </p>
<p>Baaaaang! <br>
However, the Imperial Prince's right leg slammed into Choi Han&rsquo;s sword before it could reach the left leg. </p>
<p>It was the black leg made of dead mana. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka, kahaha!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adin started to laugh. </p>
<p>&ldquo;See! Your sword can&rsquo;t even cut my right leg now!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Crack. <br>
The ground started to break as the monster-like leg slammed into the ground with some force. Choi Han and Adin started to clash again at the same time. </p>
<p>Baaaaang! <br>
Bang! Bang! </p>
<p>Black light appeared every time they clashed. Adin was smiling brightly as he raised his black aura smoke up. </p>
<p>"Are you really not going to eat it?&rdquo; </p>
<p>He then sent that smoke toward Choi Han. </p>
<p>Slaaash! <br>
Choi Han&rsquo;s sword cut through that black smoke. However, the black smoke did not disappear but instead continued to approach Choi Han. </p>
<p>Bang! <br>
Choi Han moved away from the smoke and swung his sword toward Adin only for it to be blocked again. <br>
Adin looked at Choi Han&rsquo;s shaking hands and commented. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t use your full abilities because your hands are shaking.&rdquo; </p>
<p>How could someone swing a sword properly while their hands were shaking? </p>
<p>Adin pulled out even more black despair from his wildly beating heart. An odd noise filled the underground hall at that moment. </p>
<p>Screeeech- screeeeeeech- </p>
<p>The black despair. The shrieks of the dead souls within it. <br>
The shrieks filled Choi Han&rsquo;s ears. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; </p>
<p>His emotionless face turned into a frown for the first time. </p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! <br>
Choi Han&rsquo;s heart was running wild. </p>
<p>It was telling him to eat it. </p>
<p>It was telling him to make the black despair his. It was telling him to become complete. <br>
Choi Han could feel this silent seduction fill his entire body as if it was being pricked by needles. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhh, ugh!&rdquo; </p>
<p>It was even worse than the time with the golem. <br>
Unlike the black despair that was inside the golem, the black despair that Adin was sending out was going into his body in the form of smoke. </p>
<p>Screech- screech- </p>
<p>Choi Han had no choice but to take two steps back. <br>
He heard Adin's voice in his ear at that moment. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, this thing called despair...&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adin looked into Choi Han&rsquo;s eyes that were getting duller every time he brought out more black despair and continued to speak. </p>
<p>This thing called despair. </p>
<p>&ldquo;...It is infectious. It makes sense if you think about it. Who in the world wants to be the only one in despair?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han could hear Adin's voice along with his heart that was beating even more wildly now. </p>
<p>&rsquo;He is right.&rsquo; </p>
<p>His heart was roaring at him that Adin was right. </p>
<p>It was asking him to remember what he had shouted as he was running away from enemies in the Forest of Darkness alone. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Why am I the only one facing such a situation? This is so unfair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was bringing up his past saying these were the things he had said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why it is greedy for other people's despair.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&rsquo;He's right.&rsquo; </p>
<p>His heart was agreeing with Adin again. <br>
It was saying that was why his entire body was desiring the despair of others. </p>
<p>Adin's voice and his heart mixed together to sound like one voice in Choi Han&rsquo;s ears. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You will grow stronger only by taking in this black despair.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&rsquo;Yes. Take it in. <br>
Become stronger. <br>
It&rsquo;ll be just like how you became stronger in the Forest of Darkness. <br>
Then everything will be fine.&rsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The other option would have been to be born in a position like me where anything can easily be attained...what are you doing?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adin's gaze headed toward Choi Han. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Pfft!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulders were moving up and down before they pulled back to reveal his face. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Pwa, hahahaha!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han was laughing. </p>
<ul>
<li>Human, I&rsquo;ve never seen Choi Han laugh like this before! </li>
</ul>
<p>Even Cale, who was looking at the battlefield, was so shocked that he nodded his head at Raon's comment. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Me neither.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&rsquo;I've never seen that punk laugh like this.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Cale started to frown but Choi Han&rsquo;s laugh continued for a while. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hahahaha- haha! Ugh, hahaha!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han almost couldn&rsquo;t breathe properly because he was laughing too hard. <br>
Adin's expression turned odd once Choi Han stopped laughing. </p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t there. <br>
The black aura had disappeared. </p>
<p>Choi Han had pulled back all of his black aura. Choi Han&rsquo;s next actions shocked Adin. <br>
He was charging toward Adin once again. </p>
<p>He was charging without any aura. </p>
<p>Choi Han was only using his body and his sword as he charged toward Adin. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han could hear Adin's question. <br>
He could also hear his heart. </p>
<p>&rsquo;You need to take in the black despair and become stronger.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han started to speak at that moment. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw it away.&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;...What?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adin&rsquo;s question did not reach Choi Han&rsquo;s ears. </p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! <br>
He did not hear his heart either. He just focused his hearing on his heart that was beating wildly. It was proof that there was blood flowing through his body. </p>
<p>It was proof that he was alive. </p>
<p>He remembered when he first fell into the Forest of Darkness. <br>
Choi Han had thrown a lot of things away in order to survive. </p>
<p>He had gobbled down fruit and meat that monsters had thrown away on the ground. <br>
He hid between monster corpses to hide himself and could not do anything when bugs would crawl on his body. <br>
He had even covered himself in monster shit before curling up and hiding in a hole so that the monsters would not smell him. </p>
<p>Pride. Cleanliness. Warm food. A place to peacefully lay down. <br>
He had thrown all of them away one by one. </p>
<p>There was something that filled those empty voids. </p>
<p>He didn't remember what day it started. <br>
He didn&rsquo;t remember when it started. <br>
The thing coming out of his sword was black. </p>
<p>However, there was just one thing that he did not throw away. <br>
During the night when he covered his body with the shit of predators in order to avoid other predators. <br>
During the night when it would be bad if he fell asleep. <br>
He always quietly mumbled to himself during the night. </p>
<p>&rsquo;...I am-!&rsquo; </p>
<p>It was not just during the night. <br>
He mumbled this to himself whenever he had a chance. </p>
<p>&rsquo;I am- Choi Han.&rsquo; </p>
<p>&rsquo;I am Choi Han.&rsquo; </p>
<p>&rsquo;Choi Han.&rsquo; </p>
<p>He repeated his name over and over. <br>
He repeated his name thousands and thousands of times. He repeated his name over and over with every chance he had. </p>
<p>There were no humans in the Forest of Darkness. <br>
He was trying to prevent himself from forgetting about language while in a space where he didn&rsquo;t need to speak. <br>
He was trying to not forget who he was. </p>
<p>The only thing that he did not throw away was his name. <br>
It was because that was, &rsquo;him.&rsquo; <br>
He could not throw himself away even if he threw everything else away. </p>
<p>He had never thrown his name away in the tens, no maybe even longer amount of years he had to survive. <br>
If he could exist as Choi Han... <br>
He could throw anything else away and fill it with something else. </p>
<p>Choi Han&rsquo;s sword was now in front of Adin's face. It was a regular sword without aura. <br>
Adin started to speak as soon as he saw Choi Han&rsquo;s focused eyes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw away the things you don't need.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The shaking had stopped. <br>
Choi Han&rsquo;s hands were no longer shaking. </p>
<p>He thought about the things he needed to refill. <br>
He thought about his life since leaving the Forest of Darkness. <br>
It was extremely short compared to his time in the Forest of Darkness. </p>
<p>However, those memories didn't make his hands start to shake. </p>
<p>He remembered something Raon and Cale had said during his time in the Henituse Estate. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Choi Han! I've been thinking about this for a while, but the pronunciation of your name is unique!&rsquo; <br>
&rsquo;I like it.&rsquo; <br>
&rsquo;Of course, I like your name as the human mentioned! But my name is the best!&rsquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han kicked off the ground. <br>
He watched as Adin kicked off the ground after him and slowly slashed down with his sword. </p>
<p>Raon and Cale had chatted with each other while looking at him. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Well, his name is unique, so it is easy to remember. Also...&rsquo; </p>
<p>Cale had chuckled before making the next comment. </p>
<p>&rsquo;...And Choi Han, I can&rsquo;t think of a different name for you.&rsquo; <br>
&rsquo;You're right! Choi Han is the best name for Choi Han!&rsquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han started to smile. <br>
He casually commented to Adin, who was raising up his black despair to the maximum level as he kicked off behind him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;So stupid.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adin was stupid. </p>
<p>A sword master was not just someone who could create aura.</p>
<p>It was someone who had put their whole life into the sword by swinging it thousands and thousands of times. </p>
<p>Dark Destruction Sword Art. <br>
That was the name of his sword art. </p>
<p>His life was dark at that time and he had nothing. <br>
That was why he had chosen the name Dark Destruction. He had destroyed everything in his dark life other than his name. </p>
<p>But it was now time to throw that name away. <br>
Why? </p>
<p>It was still black, but now it was full. <br>
There were too many things in his life now. </p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! <br>
Choi Han started to smile brightly. </p>
<p>The voice of his heart disappeared. Choi Han clasped his hand around his sword tighter. All of the blood inside his body was boiling. </p>
<p>&rsquo;I will grow stronger and survive in the end.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Smoke started to appear from his sword as he swung down. <br>
Changes started to appear in Choi Han&rsquo;s sword. </p>
<p>It was rising up. </p>
<p>Black aura was rising up from Choi Han&rsquo;s sword. <br>
However, it was different than before. </p>
<ul>
<li>H, human! L, look at that! T, that! </li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;I can see it too.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. <br>
It was shining. <br>
The aura was still black, but it was shining beautifully. </p>
<p>It was still a rough and violent black aura, however, it was glowing. <br>
It was different than the dead mana and the black despair. </p>
<p>It was a different color than anybody else, including the black mages, necromancers, Dark Elves, and even Adin. </p>
<p>&ldquo;T, this-&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adin&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. He could see this bright black light that was enveloping his sword that was made of dead mana and black smoke. <br>
Choi Han was laughing as if he was crying. </p>
<p>He had not thrown away all of the despair. <br>
He had only thrown half of the despair away and filled it with happiness. <br>
He combined his past and his present. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The bright black light left the tip of Choi Han&rsquo;s sword and covered Adin. </p>
<p>&ldquo;T, this is not possible!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adin could see his black smoke breaking down by the black light. </p>
<p>&rsquo;He changed his attribute?&rsquo; </p>
<p>Screeeeeech- screeeeeeech- <br>
The terrible shrieks slowly disappeared. </p>
<p>Choi Han's new aura was not trying to gobble up the black despair. It just pierced right through it. <br>
It cut through things in front of it like a sharp sword. </p>
<p>&rsquo;This is possible? <br>
A bastard whose attribute was a lower class compared to mine now has a different attribute?&rsquo; </p>
<p>Adin started to frown. </p>
<p>The advantage of having a higher class attribute had disappeared. <br>
That meant that the only thing left were the skills that they had developed on their own. <br>
The aura smoke of a highest-grade expert was not able to defeat a sword master&rsquo;s aura. </p>
<p>&ldquo;N, no-!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adin could not help but shout as the beautiful black light destroyed his dead mana sword and rushed toward him. <br>
It was at that moment. </p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang! </p>
<p>The beautiful black light and the explosion took away everyone's sight and hearing. <br>
And once the flashing of the light disappeared... </p>
<p>Boom! <br>
Adin fell once again. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Cough, cough!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adin's hands and arms were a mess as he continued to cough. The dead mana sword had long disappeared. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This, makes, no, s, sen, cough!&rdquo; </p>
<p>A black shadow appeared behind Adin. <br>
It was Choi Han. <br>
He put his sword back in his scabbard and held it like a club. He then lifted one foot up. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Uuuuugh, ugh!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han used that foot to step on Adin&rsquo;s chest as Adin coughed up black blood. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Cough! Ugh, ugh!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han turned his head as Adin started to cough up more blood because of the pressure on his chest. <br>
He could see Cale giving him a thumbs up. <br>
Cale was smiling while mouthing something. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Beat him up a bit.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han could hear Raon's voice as well. </p>
<ul>
<li>Choi Han! Amazing! I like your new attribute! It is just like you! </li>
</ul>
<p>Choi Han raised his scabbard up. <br>
Then he lowered it. </p>
<p>Pow! </p>
<p>He repeated the process. </p>
<p>Pow! </p>
<p>The beat down had started. </p>
<p>Choi Han thought about his new attribute. <br>
It was not darkness. <br>
It was not despair. </p>
<p>It did not fit into any category. There was no word to describe this attribute. </p>
<p>It was just Choi Han. It was an attribute that was like him. <br>
He liked that. <br>
It made him happy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, haha-&rdquo; </p>
<p>Choi Han could not help but laugh as he felt as if he had found himself. His child-like yet adult-like smile filled his face. </p>
<p>Pow, pow, pow! </p>
<p>He was still following Cale&rsquo;s order and beating Adin up as he did that. <br>
That was why Choi Han did not manage to see Cale's frowning face while watching him laugh as he beat someone up.</p> <a href="./chapter325.html" class="chapter-nav">
