<p>Cale could feel Bae Puh Rum and Kim Min Ah following behind him.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom!</p>
<p>The snake-headed giant was walking toward them with its large club. This monster was over 3 meters tall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roooooooar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snake-headed giant raised its arm.</p>
<p>The black club headed toward the sky.</p>
<p>Its movement didn&rsquo;t look slow at all.</p>
<p>In fact, it was much quicker than the snake wolf and the skeleton from earlier.</p>
<p>It also seemed much stronger as well.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak as Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum gulped after seeing the club being raised.</p>
<p>His voice sounded very sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bae Puh Rum! Take Kim Min Ah and move 2 meters to the left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum subconsciously grabbed Kim Min Ah and quickly moved about 2 meters to the left as if he was possessed.</p>
<p>It was much faster to fly slightly off the ground than to run.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum saw Cale moving 2 meters to the right at the same time.</p>
<p>&rsquo;That&rsquo;s the opposite direction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum and Cale were moving in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Cale shouted once more at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kim Min Ah! Stab!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah kicked off the ground as soon as she got away from Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>She could see Cale raising his spear on the right side as well.</p>
<p>His spear was heading for the giant&rsquo;s right thigh.</p>
<p>In that short instant... Kim Min Ah and Cale made eye contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think about the direction and just stab forward with all of your strength!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah finally understood what Cale meant when he told her she didn&rsquo;t need to control her ability.</p>
<p>She clenched her spear with both hands.</p>
<p>Oooooo-</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah could feel the immense amount of strength moving to her arms.</p>
<p>Her muscles became much firmer.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>The half-transparent spear in her hands slowly started to crack.</p>
<p>She then heard Cale's voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah pushed her spear forward.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-!</p>
<p>The giant&rsquo;s club hit a spear.</p>
<p>Cale's spear had struck the giant&rsquo;s club to make that loud noise.</p>
<p>The snake-headed giant had a pretty quick reaction speed.</p>
<p>That was why it had changed the direction of its club that had been heading down to respond to Cale&rsquo;s attack.</p>
<p>Craaaack-</p>
<p>The water spear cracked before it was destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s body was pushed back.</p>
<p>But at that moment...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roooooooooar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monster&rsquo;s body twisted and it screamed.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah looked down at her spear.</p>
<p>Driiiiiiiiiiiip.</p>
<p>The monster&rsquo;s black blood dripped down from the spear that had pierced the giant&rsquo;s thigh.</p>
<p>As long as it only had one club...</p>
<p>The monster could not dodge the attacks from both sides.</p>
<p>They came right after one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Holy shit... Isn&rsquo;t that monster&rsquo;s skin extremely thick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min couldn't hide his astonishment as he watched.</p>
<p>It was the same for the others.</p>
<p>The scary thing about this snake-headed giant was its skin that they could not damage no matter how many times they attacked.</p>
<p>But if there was a spear with enough strength to pierce through it...</p>
<p>It was possible.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>Cale, who had stood back up as if he was never pushed back in the first place, created another water spear as he started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pierce. I defend. Or vice versa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, right?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile appeared for the first time on the stoic Kim Min Ah's face.</p>
<p>Cale charged toward the snake-headed giant again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roooooooooar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monster headed for Kim Min Ah who had injured it.</p>
<p>She heard Cale&rsquo;s voice in his ear at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kim Min Ah, I&rsquo;m not going to say anything anymore, so follow me with your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale trusted Kim Min Ah's abilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stab as hard as you can without thinking about controlling it.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s hard to control the direction.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Just stab when I tell you to stab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah's weakness was in direction control.</p>
<p>Her spear was so strong that Kim Min Ah couldn&rsquo;t control it to go where she wanted it to go at this point in time.</p>
<p>It was quite difficult to fight against moving monsters.</p>
<p>She might accidentally harm her allies or attack nearby buildings and cause chaos.</p>
<p>But Kim Min Ah realized something while looking at Cale.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...If that person makes the monsters stop moving! If the monster is standing still where this person tells me to stab...!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then her attack would work.</p>
<p>Cale moved toward the giant&rsquo;s back and stabbed with his water spear as Kim Min Ah had those thoughts on her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward! Stab!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah followed Cale's voice and swung her spear from the front.</p>
<p>Their directions were opposite, but their movements were similar as if they were reflections.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang!</p>
<p>The giant&rsquo;s club struck Kim Min Ah&rsquo;s spear.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah was not pushed back.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the giant that was pushed back.</p>
<p>And on the pushed back giant's back...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roooooooar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water spear stabbed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm. I guess I really can&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s spear did not manage to pierce the giant&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<p>There definitely seemed to be some limits to this partial ancient power.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack.</p>
<p>However, the giant's black club started to crack.</p>
<p>It was unable to withstand Kim Min Ah's power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale immediately started to move again. His body was heading for the monster&rsquo;s left ankle.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah moved toward the right ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stab!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah's spear stabbed deep into the giant&rsquo;s right ankle.</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s spear blocked the black club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Wow...shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum was blankly staring at this sight.</p>
<p>He then made eye contact with the moving Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go bring the bird-headed snake over. That thing only goes for one person at a time.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s behind you.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Mmph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum shot up into the air in shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shhhhhhh-!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum could see a bird-head opening its beak and sticking out its snake tongue to where he had just been standing.</p>
<p>The bird's eyes looked toward Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum got chills all over his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come toward me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He quickly headed toward Cale after hearing that.</p>
<p>The bird-head chased behind Bae Puh Rum with its beak open.</p>
<p>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The snake body moved very quickly. Bae Puh Rum felt as if the bird's beak was right behind his back.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Faster...! Faster!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum used everything he had to fly even a tiny bit faster.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know what was going on, but his speed was slowly starting to increase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Holy shit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum arrived right in front of Cale who was holding his spear and aiming for the giant&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum's pupils started to shake.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Didn&rsquo;t he tell me to come here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had come as Cale had mentioned, but Cale was calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm going to crash like this!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yeah. Don&rsquo;t stop and keep coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum started to frown. His speed was too fast for him to stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y...you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale moved to the side after saying that short statement. Bae Puh Rum's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>The giant's side was now in front of Bae Puh Rum instead of Cale.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Damn it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t even speak out loud.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Crash into the giant? Into a monster with such thick skin? Am I going to die?&rsquo;</p>
<p>All sorts of thoughts filled Bae Puh Rum&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>He heard the sound of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Ah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum felt a whirlwind surrounding his body.</p>
<p>The wind was covering him.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Ride the wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum noticed multiple whirlwinds gathering in front of him as he thought about what Cale had said.</p>
<p>They looked like shields surrounding Bae Puh Rum...</p>
<p>But also like arrows aiming for the enemy.</p>
<p>He was charging toward the giant as if he had become an arrow.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum&rsquo;s instincts were telling him something.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I'm not going to get hurt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The wind, this large wind arrow, was giving Bae Puh Rum both relief and courage.</p>
<p>He only focused on the wind for now.</p>
<p>He focused on this free but firm and sharp wind.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum curled up.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>The wind arrow cradling Bae Puh Rum struck the giant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roooooooooooar!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As both Bae Puh Rum and the giant both groaned...</p>
<p>Cale shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kim Min Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant and the Bae Puh Rum bounced off in different directions after crashing.</p>
<p>And in the spot where the two of them had disappeared...</p>
<p>There was another figure that was charging forward without being able to slow down.</p>
<p>And as for the person who had been standing still as Cale had told her to follow him...</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah&rsquo;s eyes clouded over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stab!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah stabbed her spear forward with everything she had as soon as she heard Cale&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Crackle.</p>
<p>She used so much strength that the cement underneath her feet started to crack.</p>
<p>"Screeeeeeeeeech!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the spear stabbed accurately into the mouth of the open bird&rsquo;s beak.</p>
<p>As Kim Min Ah watched it happen...</p>
<p>Cale had approached her at some point, grabbed her, and quietly whispered as he moved her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pushed the spear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She let go of the spear.</p>
<p>The spear pierced the bird-headed snake.</p>
<p>"Sss-ssss--&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bird-headed snake fell on the ground without even being able to scream properly.</p>
<p>Blood was dripping out of its beak.</p>
<p>It then soon stopped moving.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah quietly watched what had just happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...I-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Did I defeat that monster?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah's pupils started to shake.</p>
<p>Cale recalled some of his memories about Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>Mother, brother, and Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>That was her family.</p>
<p>Her mother had died from a monster attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked to the side after hearing Cale&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah looked toward the angry snake-headed giant that was getting back up after falling down when Bae Puh Rum crashed into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we just need to get rid of that thing?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale took the lead and Kim Min Ah pulled out the spear that was sticking out of the monster&rsquo;s body and followed behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I'm fine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum looked at his body that didn't have a single injury in shock as he followed behind them.</p>
<p>Actually, he moved in front of them.</p>
<p>The Sound of the Wind that Cale had created... Those whirlwinds were still by his side.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I knew he would figure it out quickly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum was slowly starting to understand the method of controlling the wind.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah followed behind Bae Puh Rum who was moving in front of them.</p>
<p>Cale quietly watched the two of their backs.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum had quick speed, could change directions quickly, and act as a tanker.</p>
<p>Then there was Kim Min Ah who couldn't control the direction of her ability but the power behind it was scary.</p>
<p>These two were a great combination.</p>
<p>They would support each other.</p>
<p>Cale looked at their backs and started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two of you... If you are thankful for the things you learned from me... Help me out and go somewhere with me.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum asked and Kim Min Ah slightly looked back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roooooooooar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snake-headed giant was charging toward them.</p>
<p>But the two of them were not scared at all.</p>
<p>It was already injured in multiple places and looked ready to fall at any moment.</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seomyeon, Busan. Go there with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale was drawing an image in his mind.</p>
<p>Choi Han.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>The images of his allies who would take care of the attacking was slowly being created.</p>
<p>The couple looked confused after hearing an unexpected location. Cale shared his thoughts with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won't make you do anything dangerous. Think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them tilted their heads in confusion before charging toward the snake-headed giant as dealing with this monster came first.</p>
<p>Cale also kicked off the ground and followed behind them.</p>
<p>&rsquo;It should end quickly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The snake-headed giant should soon fall to these two who were getting a feel for how to take care of it.</p>
<p>Cale looked farther south past the snake-headed giant.</p>
<p>The leader of the seven Grade 1 taster monsters.</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger that was a mix of a lion and a tiger was looking at Cale with a piercing gaze.</p>
<p>It was scary and looked as if it wanted to rip Cale up into pieces right now.</p>
<p>Cale looked right into its eyes as he started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how to speak the human language, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger&rsquo;s eyes opened wide as if it had read Cale&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>Smirk.</p>
<p>Cale smiled while looking at its reaction.</p>
<p>Another record popped up in his mind.</p>
<p>&lt; The leader of the Grade 1 taster monsters is 1.5 times stronger than regular Grade 1 monsters and has a unique trait. &gt;<br>
&lt; This was a trait that was only found in the leader of the taster monsters since the start of the cataclysm. &gt;</p>
<p>Since the cataclysm...</p>
<p>Only at this moment...</p>
<p>A trait only shown by the leader of the taster monsters.</p>
<p>A special power that would never appear again.</p>
<p>&lt; It was able to communicate. &gt;</p>
<p>The leader of the taster monsters was the only monster that could communicate with humans.</p>
<p>Cale smiled toward the Dark Tiger.</p>
<p>Cale then added the Dark Tiger to his list of allies that would make up the attack team to fight against the unranked monster.</p>
<hr>
<p>Alberu Crossman looked toward the person sitting across from him.</p>
<p>His eyes looked tired.</p>
<p>He also looked anxious.</p>
<p>The situation... An unexpected situation had happened.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...Damn it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The White Star had smacked him from behind.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman had to come to a decision quickly.</p>
<p>Would he withdraw from the Endable Kingdom?</p>
<p>Or would he stay here until the end?</p>
<p>He then started to speak to the person who had come to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want to make a deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person nodded their head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your highness.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...What&rsquo;s the cost?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;The curse that the Sun God placed on the Crossman blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>The curse that the Sun God placed on the Crossman household.</p>
<p>&lt; Descendants of the cursed blood. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt; The touch of the Sun God will always be by your side. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt; Never set your eyes on taking over the sky. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt; The Sun will always rise. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt; The moment darkness is planted in your bodies... &gt;</p>
<p>&lt; The moment a person with that darkness becomes the head of the household, the sky will be destroyed and the ground will tremble. &gt;</p>
<p>Alberu recalled the words he had read thousands of times.</p>
<p>His voice sounded very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...How did you?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I happened to find out because of this incident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person put on an awkward smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don't worry as I will keep it a secret.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>However, the person calmly continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I was told you would receive an equivalent compensation if you place that on the scale for the deal.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Is that what the God of Death told you?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, your highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excommunicated priestess Cage nodded her head.</p>
<p>Alberu hesitated for a moment before starting to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s beneficial for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was extremely beneficial if this curse was taken away.</p>
<p>Cage ended up learning his secret, but it would not matter if the curse was removed.</p>
<p>What could Cage do about a curse that did not exist?</p>
<p>That was why he found it odd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does the God of Death want such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes looked confused.</p>
<p>He knew that Choi Han had made a deal with the God of Death. He didn&rsquo;t know the details and Choi Han didn't tell him what he had offered in return, but it couldn&rsquo;t have been something small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What benefit does the God of Death get by taking the curse of my bloodline?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Gods are unable to personally help. That is why he wants to help in a different way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders and mischievously responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gods love and cherish heroes. Especially heroes who have escaped their fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then quickly added on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you think it is the God of Death who is offering this deal?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Then?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;The God of Death is only a messenger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage turned around and headed toward the entrance of the tent.</p>
<p>Flap.</p>
<p>She lifted the flap and someone walked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Saint Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saint Jack smiled at Alberu after hearing his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sun God wishes to take the curse back.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saint Jack shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know the answer, however, he did tell me one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack repeated what the Sun God had told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that, &rsquo;I need to fix my mistake, the path that went wrong a long time ago.&rsquo; He also said that right now was the only time to do it. This is his only chance to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage handed Alberu a video communication device.</p>
<p>This video communication device looked different than regular ones as it had a perfect split of black and white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you agree to the deal, only you will be able to use this video communication device as the person making the deal. You'll be connected right away.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...You mean to Cale Henituse?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, your highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage gave a short response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This video communication device will become the only way to communicate with young master Cale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu reached his hand out toward the video communication device.</p> <a href="./chapter567.html" class="chapter-nav">
