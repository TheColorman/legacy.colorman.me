<p>However, Cale did not care about the decreasing time.<br>
Alberu, who was looking at him, started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You plan on defeating the White Star with overwhelming strength?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, your highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale's face was completely pale. However, his eyes were more focused and alive than ever before. Then there was this short but confident response.<br>
Alberu nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to that comment as he started to walk back to the chair he had been sitting on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human, you seem okay, but hurry up and go eat one of the apple pies in the basket! You cannot faint! I'm going to tattle to grandpa Ron, Goldie gramps, Choi Han, Beacrox, and good girl Mary!</li>
</ul>
<p>He almost chuckled at Raon's voice in his mind.<br>
He then heard Alberu&rsquo;s voice as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So how do you plan on defeating the White Star with ove- huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Alberu could not finish his question.<br>
He reached out his hand.</p>
<p>He could see Cale starting to stumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master Cale!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Young master-nim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people who had nervously been looking at him with concern all jumped up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human!</li>
</ul>
<p>Raon quickly charged toward Cale and used his head to support Cale&rsquo;s falling body. He also reached his two front paws out to help support Cale's upper body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shocked Alberu&rsquo;s hand grabbed the falling Cale's arm.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>Alberu could see red mana quickly surrounding Cale at the same time. It was Rosalyn's mana.<br>
She had quickly cast her mana to support Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Ha...Damn it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s mumbling made Taylor and Cage, who had quickly run toward him, and Alberu, who was holding him up, look at him with odd expressions.</p>
<p>Cale looked shocked.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human! Why do you have such an expression when you were about to faint?! You really are a weak and stupid human!</li>
</ul>
<p>Raon slowly moved his round head and chubby front paws away from supporting Cale after seeing Rosalyn&rsquo;s red mana surround Cale and started to nag.<br>
Cale&rsquo;s upper body had curled forward as he was about to fall so only Raon had seen his shocked expression.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What the...?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale was confused.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What is going on with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He could not understand why his body was stumbling like this.<br>
He had not used any of his ancient powers nor his ability.<br>
He wasn't dizzy and his body wasn&rsquo;t heating up with a severe fever.<br>
He didn&rsquo;t feel like he was going to vomit either.</p>
<p>&rsquo;But why is there no strength in my body?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale followed the gentle movement of the red mana as it slowly laid him down. The red mana then slowly moved him to the couch.<br>
Cale could finally see the others once the mana lifted his upper body back up. Alberu bluntly commented as they made eye contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it would be like this. Your face was a mess. Tsk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them looked as if they had expected Cale to faint. He knew Raon probably had a similar expression even though he couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...But I am fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu looked toward Rosalyn after hearing Cale's comment and Rosalyn smiled as she responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re driving me nuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale flinched.<br>
Alberu didn&rsquo;t care and pointed to the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay him down there. The couch is not very comfortable.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;As you wish, your highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn moved her hand and the red mana laid Cale down on the bed.<br>
Cale laid there and looked at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He heard two voices at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at how pale you are. What scared the mighty Cale Henituse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of them was Alberu.</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like your body got shaken up for a moment from fear and horror.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other was the Scary Giant Cobblestone.<br>
Cale became even more shocked after hearing their comments.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I'm afraid of something? Really?<br>
I, of all people, reacted because of fear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He could not believe it.<br>
He'd accept it if it was because of anger, but he was not afraid.<br>
But Cale had no choice but to accept his current condition after raising his hand and putting it on his forehead.</p>
<p>His hand was slightly shaking while his forehead was covered with sweat.<br>
It was no wonder people were saying that he was scared.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What am I scared about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale did not need to think long to recall the records of the past he saw when everything had turned black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale scoffed in disbelief.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human! Why are you laughing? Something is definitely weird! This is not the time to laugh! Human, you look like you are in critical condition! You are laughing when you are hurt! You can&rsquo;t go crazy too!</li>
</ul>
<p>Cale was at a loss for words after hearing Raon's comments.<br>
This six-years-old black Dragon was really good at putting him at a loss for words. However, this helped Cale calm down. His body then soon returned to normal.</p>
<p>Cale heard someone cautiously calling out to him at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale turned his head to see an expression he had never seen on Cage's face before. She was hesitating unlike her usual self and cautiously asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, did it really not have anything serious written on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage was asking once again if the note had anything bad or serious written on it.<br>
That question made everybody look toward Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale contemplated for a moment and Cage quickly added on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you don't have to share because you were told to look at it alone! It is your personal problem, young master Cale. I know you said that you were going to ignore the contents, but I was just curious if it said something serious on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priestess Cage&rsquo;s actions were so cautious that Cale decided to share his honest sentiments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm, not really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage hesitated for a moment before calmly asking once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then can you tell us at least a little bit of that not so serious note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale debated for a moment.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Well, the God of Death never said to keep it a secret. I guess I can tell them a portion without telling them the important parts?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It did say that the paper would burn if he showed it to others, but that wasn&rsquo;t saying he couldn&rsquo;t tell them about it as long as he didn't show the paper to them.<br>
Cale looked toward the others.</p>
<p>He could see the concerned expressions in the eyes of everyone surrounding him.<br>
They would probably worry even more if he hid everything. That was why Cale decided to be honest about at least a portion of it.</p>
<p>&rsquo;First of all, I can't tell them about my relationship with Choi Jung Gun, Choi Jung Soo, and Choi Han. I can&rsquo;t talk about Kim Rok Soo either. I also can&rsquo;t tell them about how I will need to make a decision on that day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After taking out couple of different shocking details, Cale casually commented on one of the few remaining pieces of information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said I was supposed to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence filled the room at that moment.<br>
Cale recalled a portion of what the God of Death had told him.</p>
<p>&lt; Kim Rok Soo, you were the one who was supposed to die. &gt;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Mm, yeah. That's probably the least shocking thing to tell them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale had a satisfied expression on his face after telling his friends a portion of it as he was still telling them the truth.<br>
Cale was planning on slowly sharing more of his honest thoughts and feelings with more than just Raon and Choi Han now. Cale wanted to slowly change the records in his mind to happy records.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Yes. I really want that to happen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale started to smile as he felt these odd emotions from his beating heart.<br>
His hand had stopped shaking and he was no longer sweating. He could feel himself being at peace.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You crazy bastard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Hmm?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale turned his head.<br>
He could see an extremely angry Alberu Crossman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master Cale, you really are someone we cannot leave alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could also see the vicious look in the smiling Rosalyn's face.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Who can&rsquo;t they leave alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale was confused at the two of their reactions.<br>
It didn&rsquo;t matter as he then heard Raon&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am the great and mighty Raon Miru. I will not even leave the gods alone. I will defeat them all.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;What the heck is wrong with him now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Raon was not sniffling. His voice sounded vicious. Even more vicious than Rosalyn&rsquo;s glare. He really sounded like he would go and defeat some gods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That rotten...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale flinched at the voice that suddenly started to shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can there be such a backstabbing motherfucking nonsensical situation like this?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage was the one who was shouting.<br>
She looked visibly angry as the rough words continued to pour out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it would be like this! So, you're going to be like this even after everything I told you?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage was shouting toward the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just watch! I'm never going back to the temple! I am free! Free! I'm going to drink all I want, play all I want, and live a completely free life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat pat.</p>
<p>Her close friend Taylor patted her shoulders and calmly started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cage, I&rsquo;ll cheer you on and hope you can achieve your dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;What the hell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale made eye contact with Alberu as his expression turned into one of shock.<br>
Alberu started to spit out comment after comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why the heck are you looking so lost like you have no idea what is going on? You're blinking your eyes like a cow when you were told that you were supposed to die? Huh? You got no damn sense at all. What the hell are you looking at?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...But I'm not dead?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale flinched at the multiple vicious glares pointed at him but continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;you were supposed to die,&rsquo; is past tense. It is not saying I will die now or in the future, right? I'm not going to die now.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Aigoo, my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu sat down on the corner of the bed and grabbed his head. Rosalyn patted his shoulder and Cale quickly added on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm going to live for a very long time. I will be a wealthy slacker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He immediately heard Raon's voice.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s right. The human will live as a slacker with me. I will be a slacker as well! I will continue and continue to be a slacker next to the human!</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;Yes, yes. Your future is something you decide for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale respected Raon's future goals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I plan on living a very happy life with the children and the others, so there is no need to worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence filled the room after he made those comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>...Human, I will definitely, definitely live a happy life with you and the rest of our family members! I will destroy anybody, whether it be the gods or the White Star, if they get in our way!</li>
</ul>
<p>The silence was soon broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...It'd be one thing if you weren't so good with words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu looked at Cale with an expression that seemed to be saying, &rsquo;What the hell am I going to do with this punk,&rsquo; before he started to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young master Cale, make sure you remember those words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn slowly pulled the blanket up to Cale&rsquo;s neck as she warmly commented.<br>
Taylor and Cage nodded their heads and their eyes were sparkling toward Cale.</p>
<p>&rsquo;How did the atmosphere in the room change so much?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale felt frustrated but decided not to think about anything. He thought he could just brush it off since they seemed to understand his point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don't have to do anything until tomorrow, so get some rest for now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn said that and made Cage and Taylor move away from the bed. Alberu said that he was going to chat with Rosalyn and closed the curtains around the bed and moved away as well.</p>
<p>Squirm squirm.</p>
<p>Cale could feel something squirming toward him underneath the blanket.</p>
<p>It was most likely the invisible Raon crawling toward him.</p>
<p>Cale moved his hand underneath the blanket and the round head fell right into his palm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;Yes, yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale felt Raon's body heat as he curled up next to him and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>It was probably a good idea to get some rest as Rosalyn mentioned.<br>
And once he woke back up...</p>
<p>&rsquo;I'm going to fucking destroy him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He needed to start moving to destroy the White Star.<br>
Cale could hear Rosalyn and Alberu talking to each other, but he could not understand what they were saying as he slowly fell asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Your highness ... For his health ......&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...A slacker ... you're right ... Get some rest......&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were some of the things he heard as he fell asleep.</p>
<hr>
<p>Pat. Pat.</p>
<p>Cale opened his eyes to something patting his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human, you woke up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raon snickered as he rubbed his face on Cale&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>
Cale blinked his eyes a few times before sitting up.</p>
<p>Chhhhhh-</p>
<p>He could see Alberu Crossman sleeping on the couch once he opened the curtains surrounding the bed. The others were not in the bedroom.<br>
They were probably all led to their own rooms.</p>
<p>Cale woke up and walked over to Alberu.<br>
Raon followed behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human, human! They&rsquo;ll be here soon!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...Yeah. I know.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You look fine now!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, I'm fine.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Human, are you and I going to happily live together in the future?&rdquo;<br>
"Why are you asking such an obvious question?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hehe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them were chatting like normal.<br>
That might have been what woke Alberu up. Cale looked at the crown prince who had his disguised appearance up even as he slept and the two of them made eye contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch.</p>
<p>Cale took a bite of a cookie.<br>
He was hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human, eat some apple pie as well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Dragon put a piece of apple pie in Cale&rsquo;s other hand. Alberu looked toward Cale who was eating a cookie as soon as he woke up while sitting there with bed hair with shock. Cale then started to speak to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your highness, there&rsquo;s some drool on your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale continued to speak as Alberu started to frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Syrem, where is that bastard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu&rsquo;s expression stiffened up.</p>
<p>Syrem, the fake Dragon Slayer.<br>
He was currently imprisoned in the deepest and most dangerous underground prison in the Roan Kingdom.<br>
He was someone who possessed three ancient powers.<br>
Furthermore, he had launched the most devastating attack on the Roan Kingdom during the battle against the Indomitable Alliance and had caused the most damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has his execution been determined?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale casually asked and Alberu casually responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Alberu continued to speak in a very administrative tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nobles Meeting seem like they will determine a date soon. They kept pushing it back for many reasons. The majority believe that we need to thoroughly punish him since he was involved in both the battle at the Henituse territory and the Northeastern shores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale didn't respond and just took another bite of the cookie.</p>
<p>Crunch, crunch.</p>
<p>He munched on the cookie for a while before starting to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need to go see that bastard.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I'll lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He needed to go button the first button in his plan to destroy the White Star.</p> <a href="./chapter394.html" class="chapter-nav">
