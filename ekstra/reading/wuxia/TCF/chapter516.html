<p>&ldquo;...My goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn peeked toward Duke Fredo with a, &rsquo;what kind of nonsense is this?&rsquo; type of expression without any awkwardness after not seeing everyone for a while.</p>
<p>She then asked Cale a question out of concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm surprised that your blood is delicious for the Vampires, young master Cale. Why is that the case?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale awkwardly answered back but he had a theory about it.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Is it because of the Vitality of the Heart?&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was the only reasonable explanation he could come up with.<br>
Cale slowly turned away from Rosalyn and looked toward Duke Fredo.<br>
Rosalyn looked toward the Vampire as well.</p>
<p>Fredo continued to smile as he looked at the two of them.<br>
He then quietly spoke, almost in a whisper, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your conversation is cute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn and Cale both started to frown as if they had eaten an unripe fruit.<br>
However, the two of them did not have time to respond in any other way.</p>
<p>Duuuduuduuu-</p>
<p>The rumbling was getting closer.<br>
The rumbling seemed to be coming from a spot much closer than last time.</p>
<p>&rsquo;We need to go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was time to move.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said that you want to make a deal with me?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pan started to frown and look toward Cale who asked once more.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Is he really planning on working together with that person? ...But he&rsquo;s the leader of the bastards who killed our Brigade members.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pan felt anger inside. However, he kept that anger inside him.</p>
<p>There were no allies and enemies in war.<br>
There were times people who were killing each other would find a common enemy to become allies.</p>
<p>Pan just found it difficult to understand Cale who was acting like this.</p>
<p>&rsquo;The enemies are charging toward us from behind. Do we have the time for this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It happened as he subconsciously started to pout and his mouth almost opened to say something.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo looked toward Cale and calmly responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I truly want to make a deal with you.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I can't trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The allies looked toward Cale who sternly responded.<br>
Many of them were showing their anxiousness at Cale who was wasting time with this conversation.</p>
<p>Cale pointed behind him at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me proof that you mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fredo started to smile.</p>
<p>"Are you telling me to attack my allies right now?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;That's for you to figure out. I will accept your invitation later if you show me some kind of proof that I can trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke Fredo lightly chuckled and asked while looking at a relaxed Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t accept the deal but just the invitation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corners of Cale&rsquo;s lips twisted up.</p>
<p>"Why are you asking such an obvious question? Isn&rsquo;t it more than enough for me to hear out the bastard who killed my allies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pan's eyes clouded over.<br>
On the other hand, Duke Fredo thought for a moment before nodding his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm. I guess that makes sense, but I cannot fight against my allies right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked toward Cale as if he was asking for Cale&rsquo;s understanding before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need to be wary of some people's feelings right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Be wary of some people&rsquo;s feelings?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale made sure to remember those words.</p>
<p>&rsquo;A Duke should be the highest title of the nobles, but he needs to be wary of someone else right now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Was he someone without much strength?</p>
<p>&rsquo;No. He&rsquo;s stronger than the other bastards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His battle experiences had helped him develop an eye for people. The Vampire in front of him was much scarier than the Knights Brigade chasing behind them.</p>
<p>&rsquo;That&rsquo;s why Bud hasn't said anything about defeating this guy and running away to avoid the Knights Brigade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bud had been quiet since earlier, only paying attention to the enemies approaching from the rear.<br>
Cale recalled all those points in his head while keeping his gaze focused on the Vampire. Fredo started to speak as if to respond to his gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Who is that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale could see Choi Han&rsquo;s sword point elsewhere as he flinched at the name he did not recognize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. My liege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rustle.</p>
<p>Someone jumped off the tree right behind the group.<br>
The pale woman was definitely a Vampire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them a map of this area.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...We already have a map of this area?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just take it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke Fredo told him to take the item from the woman who had approached him while walking without making any noise and Cale stood still for a moment before taking it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;......!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then could not hide his shock.<br>
Rosalyn who had been looking at the map over Cale's shoulder subconsciously started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gate-&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, she covered her mouth after saying two words.<br>
She then looked toward Cale. The two of them gulped while looking at each other.<br>
Cale could not help but clench the hand holding the map.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...It&rsquo;s a map of the Gate to the Demon World!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Gate to the Demon World, the large sinkhole that was one of the Eastern continent's Three Restricted Areas.</p>
<p>This map had information about the inside of that sinkhole.<br>
Cale realized something the moment he saw the information.</p>
<p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s a kingdom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The large sinkhole was a large kingdom divided into many floors.<br>
It was not just a simple hole.<br>
There was already a large city inside the large hole that was as wide as many villages put together.</p>
<p>Cale heard Duke Fredo's voice in his mind at that moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the Endable Kingdom.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a map of the kingdom as Cale had expected.</p>
<ul>
<li>As you expected, we have created a kingdom. The kingdom starts in the northern region past this mountain, with our capital located inside the sinkhole with the Gate to the Demon World.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cale could feel his heart beating wildly.</p>
<p>This was a key.</p>
<p>This battle that was divided into four locations... And the enemies chasing behind Cale and the allies to stop them...<br>
This was a key to instantly flip things over if they managed to endure past all of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Do you know the meaning of giving this to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale was the White Star's enemy.<br>
Duke Fredo's allies were currently trying to catch Cale as well.</p>
<p>However, This Duke had given Cale lots of information about their base.<br>
It was the truth about a place that had been thoroughly kept a secret.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Is this bastard crazy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Duke Fredo and heard his voice in his mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course. I know the value of what I gave you.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rsquo;No. This bastard is not crazy. There&rsquo;s something he wants. What could it be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale now knew about the kingdom's location, name, and Duke Fredo's position.<br>
However, there was one thing he did not know.</p>
<p>&rsquo;The White Star. What position does that bastard have in the Endable Kingdom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s mind quickly processed information and put together many different pieces to figure things out.</p>
<p>Cale finally started to speak after a while.</p>
<p>"What is the White Star's position?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale repeated the question he had asked before.<br>
Unlike last time, Fredo answered the question.</p>
<ul>
<li>The White Star can be considered our, &rsquo;liege.&rsquo; But he is not our &rsquo;king.&rsquo; He needs to complete the mission given to him in order to become the king.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, haha-&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale started to laugh.<br>
The others looked toward him with confusion but Cale slowly started to walk.<br>
He walked up to Duke Fredo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han tried to stop Cale but Cale motioned that it was okay before walking right up to Duke Fredo.<br>
He then brought his face close to Fredo's ear and started to whisper.<br>
He was speaking so quietly that only Fredo would hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to be king, don't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s eyes were full of certainty as he asked in a laughing voice.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had said the following.</p>
<p>The White Star, who was their liege by name, would become the true king if he could complete his mission.<br>
But what happens if he can't complete that mission?</p>
<p>This bastard had said since earlier that he would only tell Cale the truth.<br>
The things he said brushed past Cale&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I am a Vampire who knows about grace and pride. That is why I won't serve anyone.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;I will only tell you the truth. I truly do not serve anyone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not serve the White Star or the Demonic race.</p>
<p>He did not place anyone above him.<br>
There was nobody he truly served.</p>
<p>What could that mean?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want that king position for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;That&rsquo;s why he's betraying his allies and trying to cooperate with me, the enemy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care about the Demonic race at all. All you care about is becoming king. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale moved his face away from Fredo's ear.</p>
<p>&rsquo;He&rsquo;s just joking when he says he wants my blood. His true goal is to become the king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was certain that his thoughts were correct after seeing Duke Fredo's face.</p>
<p>Smirk.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had a painting-like smile on his face.<br>
He slowly whispered so that only Cale could hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct. I wish to be king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale put the map in his pocket and responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting for your invitation.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I'll send the invitation soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shhhhhh-</p>
<p>Duke Fredo's body slowly started to turn black.</p>
<p>His black skin dispersed like ash and his body started to disappear.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll give you one more present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale who was walking toward the snowy region, stopped.<br>
Duke Fredo who was disappearing with his subordinate Liana said something as the last few bits of ashes disappeared into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Star went to the Roan Kingdom a moment ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;...Where did the White Star go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.<br>
Fredo continued to speak as he did that.</p>
<p>His voice was slowly getting quieter as his body disappeared.<br>
However, Cale still heard him properly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Star knows very well. He knows that when you are lacking information, everything can be resolved by having the life of the leader in his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke Fredo disappeared after saying that.<br>
They had no way of knowing where nor how he disappeared.</p>
<p>However, that was not important.<br>
Rosalyn subconsciously shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Marquis Taylor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The White Star would head to the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s Northwest region.</p>
<p>The White Star would try to quickly find the ancient power while Cale was elsewhere.</p>
<p>&rsquo;That means that he needs to quickly gather information about that region in order to find the information he needs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The easiest way to do that was to capture the leader and get information out of that person as Duke Fredo mentioned.</p>
<p>The leader of the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s Northwest region who would have that information was Marquis Taylor Stan.</p>
<p>&rsquo;We need to save Marquis Taylor!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalyn heard Cale shout at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;F*ck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her gaze.<br>
They needed to quickly head to the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s Northwest region.<br>
Cale should know that as well.<br>
However, Cale's thoughts were different than her thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...It&rsquo;s not Marquis Taylor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taylor was not the leader.<br>
The White Star should know that as well.<br>
He should know that the Roan Kingdom had a leader whom even Cale reported to.<br>
Information would go past that person or gather to that person.</p>
<p>&rsquo;The Roan Kingdom has already sent troops to the Northwest region while knowing that the White Star's subordinates are there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>That meant that the troops at the capital would decrease.</p>
<p>Would the White Star not know that?<br>
Would he miss that fact?</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had said the following.</p>
<p>&rsquo;The White Star went to the Roan Kingdom a moment ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Roan Kingdom had not discovered the White Star's subordinates a moment ago.<br>
He had already heard about that from crown prince Alberu while he was fighting in the maze underneath the Molden palace.</p>
<p>That meant that the White Star was moving separately from the White Star's subordinates who have been discovered in the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...We need to hurry to the palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman.</p>
<p>The White Star would aim for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is driving me crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale started to frown.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Alberu Crossman, if it is him?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That person is probably heading to the Northwest region and not in the palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked Raon to connect the call before quickly heading to the snowy region.</p>
<hr>
<p>Alberu gave an order to his servant.</p>
<p>"Go bring me my armor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>The large door then opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your highness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piiiiiiiiiii- Piiiiiiiiiiii-</p>
<p>Alberu&rsquo;s vassals calling for him from past the door and the emergency alarm were mixing together.</p>
<p>Alberu stepped through the door.</p> <a href="./chapter515.html" class="chapter-nav">
