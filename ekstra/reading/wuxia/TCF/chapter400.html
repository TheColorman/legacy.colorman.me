<p>Plavin Singten gulped while looking at the masked man who was asking if he wanted to live or die.</p>
<p>&rsquo;How did it......!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then started to think about how he ended up receiving a threat like this.</p>
<p>A few days ago, no, it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago. It happened about two days ago.</p>
<p>After he handed the bag filled with magic stones to the man who seemed to be the masked man's subordinate, that subordinate told him about a secret location to use for any emergency messages.</p>
<p>For some reason, something came up that made it necessary for him to use that emergency contact almost right away.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Should I not have told him about the Alchemists&rsquo; Towers and the magic faction&rsquo;s plans?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower that Plavin was connected with had told him that the four Alchemists&rsquo; Towers would work together to attack the capital, as well as the fact that there was a mysterious mage faction working with them.<br>
Furthermore, the Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower had asked Plavin for materials and magic stones to use in this battle.</p>
<p>Plavin had debated what to do before providing this information to the man who seemed close to the Church of the Sun God.<br>
And tonight... That man had come to Plavin&rsquo;s secret residence once again.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...And who they heck are they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The red-haired man with the black mask from last time was not here today.<br>
Instead, there were two masked men standing behind the man in the white mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are your eyes moving around so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flinch.</p>
<p>Plavin quickly moved his gaze from the two men to the ground.<br>
Cale watched him and started to chuckle. His gaze headed behind Plavin. Plavin&rsquo;s trusted assassin subordinates were quietly standing behind him.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human! I want to remove my invisibility! I want to stand next to grandpa Ron and the tasty food providing Beacrox! I want to wear a mask too!</li>
</ul>
<p>Cale pretended not to hear Raon. The black Dragon was excited for some reason.</p>
<p>Choi Han and Bud were not here right now.<br>
Beacrox and Ron were with him instead.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Choi Han.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale had given a different order to Choi Han who tried to follow him to the Empire.</p>
<p>&rsquo;You go and quickly take care of the Syrem issue before coming over. Come with Miss Rosalyn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han had flinched before shaking his head after hearing Cale&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&rsquo;What is it, do you need me to come with you?&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;No, Cale-nim. I can take care of the Syrem situation on my own.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;I'll be waiting for you.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Yes, Cale-nim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han had headed to the Roan Kingdom's capital instead.<br>
Of course, Cale did not send him alone. Eruhaben was moving with Choi Han while Cale brought the rest of the group to the Empire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cough, cough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked back at Plavin Singten after hearing some coughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I apologize, something seems to have gone down my windpipe, cough, ahem, hem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale gently started to speak to Plavin as he had done to his guild subordinates when he was Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you were just choking. I thought you were poisoned or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tips of Plavin's fingers were shaking. His gaze headed toward the red fog that was eerily visible outside the open terrace window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That poisonous fog should not come into the terrace. You would die instantly if you were hit by that poison. That was why I was worried when you started to cough, guild leader Plavin.&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;Ha, haha- thankfully it was not poison. Haha-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Damn it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Plavin was laughing externally, but his mind was turning into a mess.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Why is he acting like this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had told the Church of the Sun God about the four Alchemists&rsquo; Towers&rsquo; plans.<br>
So why was the man asking if he wanted to live or die instead of giving him a reward that matched his contribution?</p>
<p>&rsquo;Should I not have told them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Plavin's mind was getting complicated when he heard a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is the Singten Merchant Guild gathering materials? It looks like the materials soldiers need during war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin felt his heart instantly sink.</p>
<p>He had been stealthily gathering war materials as the Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower had asked.<br>
Of course, he had left this part out when he told this man from the Church of the Sun God about the Alchemists&rsquo; Towers&rsquo; plans.</p>
<p>He was doing what he needed to do to keep his connection with both the Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower and the Church of the Sun God.<br>
He was confident that he would not get caught. That was why he had been stealthily gathering the materials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...How did you......?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So how did this man find out about it?<br>
Plavin could see a warm smile and a cold gaze directed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like your mind and your body are busy trying to maintain your connections everywhere. Those are the kind of people who die first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin suddenly felt suffocated.<br>
Plavin's eyes looked back down on their own after seeing the man's gaze that seemed to be saying he knew about everything.<br>
Cale looked toward Plavin with an even colder gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our side discovered your merchant guild gathering war materials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fear appeared on Plavin&rsquo;s face.<br>
However, the man continued to speak in a gentle voice as if he understood Plavin's situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. I'm sure you don&rsquo;t want to let go of our side, but you don't want to let go of the Alchemists&rsquo; Towers&rsquo; side either. You have no way of knowing who is going to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Plavin had to jerk his head up after hearing the next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are you looking for slaves? Did they say they need dead mana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All emotions disappeared from Plavin's face.<br>
The fear and anxiety disappeared and turned emotionless while his pupils started to shake uncontrollably.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...He saw that as well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Alchemists&rsquo; Tower had not just asked Plavin for materials and funds.</p>
<p>Slaves.</p>
<p>They asked him to quickly procure slaves to create dead mana once again.</p>
<p>However, doing this would mean he was completely going against the Church of the Sun God. Even the corrupt Church of the Sun God would still keep their foundational beliefs.<br>
Furthermore, black magic was the reason the Church of the Sun God was able to take control in the Mogoru Empire once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it seem like you are eager to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes. That is how it must seem to the Church of the Sun God.<br>
It was one thing if he didn&rsquo;t get caught, but he would be dead if he did.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Fuck!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Plavin started to wonder how things had turned out like this.<br>
Just how did he know about the war materials and slaves he was gathering in secret?</p>
<p>Of course, Cale had his methods of finding things out.<br>
Some beings had welcomed him as soon as he arrived at the Mogoru Empire&rsquo;s Imperial Prince Palace. They had come to talk to him once he held the top's whip in his hand.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Hey Cale, the people from the merchant guild you visited were kidnapping people. They said they'll turn them into slaves!&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;That&rsquo;s right! They said they needed dead mana!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Forget a munchkin, he had a cheat key in his hands now.</p>
<p>Cale had started to think after hearing the information from the Wind Elementals.<br>
The Wind Elementals would bring him information even if he stood still.</p>
<p>Of course, this didn&rsquo;t make him omnipotent.<br>
Wind Elementals did not know how to use teleportation magic.<br>
They could move more freely and faster than others, but there was still a limit to it such that Cale who was in the Roan Kingdom could not hear the voices of the Wind Elementals in the Mogoru Empire&rsquo;s capital.</p>
<p>However, that meant that as soon as Cale arrived in the Mogoru Empire&rsquo;s capital, the Wind Elementals he had connected with at the capital would bring him information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singten Merchant Guild Leader Plavin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin&rsquo;s face was emotionless without signs of fear or anxiety. On the other hand, his eyes were filled with chaos and despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we decided to watch what you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin's eyes opened wide.<br>
His gaze headed toward the masked Cale.</p>
<p>"We have just been watching to see how far the four Alchemists&rsquo; Towers would go.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin let out a gasp.<br>
They had been watching. They had been watching without doing anything.<br>
He became at a loss for words after hearing that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it looks like we need to take those towers down now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then held back another gasp after hearing what came next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to head over to the Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin hesitated for a moment. He wondered why the man was asking this question.<br>
It was a different topic than what they were discussing, but Plavin cautiously answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...The original plan was for me to go. I needed to go at least once.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I'm going with you.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin looked at the masked man in shock.</p>
<p>&rsquo;He's going there?<br>
Does he mean he's going there for war? That doesn't seem to be the case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man calmly and leisurely started to speak to the chaotic Plavin. His slightly smiling lips looked beautiful and warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new light wishes to meet with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin had no choice but to shut up again after hearing that.<br>
However, it was different than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two weeks I discussed last time. I guess now it is about 12 days. At that time...&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new light. The Pope of the Sun God.<br>
He wishes to meet with Plavin.<br>
The original plan was to meet in two weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take care of things by then and meet with relaxed hearts at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Take care of things.<br>
Plavin who understood the meaning of those words felt his heart beating wildly as he started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Is that possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was it possible to take care of the Alchemists&rsquo; Towers&rsquo; factions within two weeks?<br>
Plavin asked and the man responded back immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plavin, we know the enemy. But do you think the enemy knows us? They don't even know someone like me exists?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin felt as if someone had smacked him on the back of the head with a large hammer.</p>
<p>The man was right.<br>
The man in front of him knew about the Alchemists&rsquo; Towers&rsquo; plans and their approximate strength.<br>
However, the Alchemists&rsquo; Towers did not even know about the existence of this masked man in front of him.</p>
<p>The man who knew the enemy's plans was saying that they should quickly take care of things.<br>
Was that arrogance?</p>
<p>&rsquo;No. He&rsquo;s not that type of person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Church of the Sun God in the Empire had fallen.<br>
This man was someone who would still stealthily approach him in the Caro Kingdom to make a deal rather than focus on lifting the Church of the Sun God back up.</p>
<p>He was not someone who would act without confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are smart enough to know.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...May I really meet with the person who will be the new light once everything is over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin could see the masked man hand him a small plaque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin knew about this plaque.<br>
This plaque was what the previous Pope had used to order him to get to, &rsquo;work,&rsquo; which meant to bring him bribes. This plaque was said to be something that could not be faked or created by anyone other than the Church of the Sun God.<br>
He could tell that this was real because he had seen it once before.<br>
Plavin instantly reached toward the plaque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the masked man put the plaque back in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Is it mine once everything is over?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Who else would I give it to? It&rsquo;s enough for me to show you proof, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale could see Plavin's eyes fill with greed as if they had never been full of despair just moments ago.<br>
Plavin had no way of knowing he would walk into a pit of fire on his own volition.</p>
<p>This plaque was something Saint Jack had given at Cale's request. Of course, Saint Jack had said something as he handed it over.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Young master Cale-nim, I can make as many of these plaques as possible if they are being used to catch such evildoers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Plavin Singten will be sent to prison once everything was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plavin Singten, does the other side know that your subordinates are assassins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other side was naturally talking about the Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, they do. I had to inform them of everyone on my side to enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Secrecy was more important to the Alchemists&rsquo; Towers than ever right now.<br>
They needed to thoroughly determine who was on their side and who wasn&rsquo;t, thoroughly investigating anybody who gave them even the slightest of suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will become suspicious of me if I hid my subordinates. They will think I was hiding something from them.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Then I just need to become your subordinate. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin did his best to put on a smile as he nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, that is the case. I will work very hard.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You really do seem like someone who is well-versed in finding ways to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin could not respond.</p>
<p>This person was saying he was going to go to the Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower while pretending to be his subordinate.</p>
<p>Plavin clenched his fists.<br>
He would have no choice but to be on the same side as this man as soon as they went to the Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower together. There was no way the Alchemists&rsquo; Towers would let a traitor who brought someone from the Church of the Sun God continue to live.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile toward the assassins who were standing behind Plavin with masks on their faces. They avoided Cale&rsquo;s gaze and Cale looked back toward Plavin as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right. The two behind me are going with us as well.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I will get everything prepared, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the end of Plavin and Cale's conversation.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next day, Cale opened his eyes.<br>
His sight that had gone blurry from teleportation magic started to return.</p>
<p>Paaaat!</p>
<p>A lush forest appeared in front of him once the bright light disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a while, merchant guild leader-nim.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes. Nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin Singten who was in front of Cale stepped off the teleportation magic circle and gave a short response to the person wearing an alchemist robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people behind you?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;My subordinates. You know about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three people wearing black masks and assassin outfits were behind Plavin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, we do. But it looks like their physiques have changed a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smiling Alchemist's eyes were sharp with suspicion.<br>
Cale was amazed that they were even checking the physiques of Singten Merchant Guild leader&rsquo;s subordinates. However, the Singten Merchant Guild leader was smart and good at acting.<br>
Plavin Singten calmly responded back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to change people who know many secrets every so often. Don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alchemist put on a real smile this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As expected. This is why I respect you so much, Singten Merchant Guild leader-nim.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;This is nothing. It is just necessary for my trade.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Then I will lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alchemist pointed to a direction.<br>
Cale could see a tall tower past the forest.</p>
<p>That was the Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human! I'm here as well!</li>
</ul>
<p>Raon, Ron, and Beacrox were with him.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Bud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale had told Bud who was responsible for communicating with everyone before he came here.</p>
<p>&rsquo;This battle is a battle involving two things.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;What two things?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In order to fight with overwhelming strength...</p>
<p>&rsquo;Money and magic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He recalled the orders he gave Bud.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Strike as soon as I give the signal.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;We will strike the enemy first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale could hear the Alchemist&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Please follow me.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plavin took the lead and Cale moved behind him as if he was protecting Plavin.<br>
The Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower.<br>
They were heading toward the first place that they would loot dry.</p> <a href="./chapter399.html" class="chapter-nav">
