<p>Cale clenched his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p><p>November 7th, 11:55 pm.</p><ul><li>You are overcoming the situations quite well so far.</li></ul><p>The sealed god started to speak to Cale.</p><ul><li>That is why I desire you even more.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Gasp.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale took a deep breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Cale-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han could not hide his anxiety while observing Cale.</p><p>But Cale was looking up at the sky.</p><p>He heard the voice again.</p><ul><li>The other gods are pulling strings in order to help you probably because you are such a desirable child.</li></ul><p>He felt as if his heart was being ripped out.</p><p>&rsquo;No.&rsquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t his heart, but something deeper inside. It felt as if some spot deep in his body that he couldn't pinpoint was being twisted.</p><p>However, Cale had a different thought first.</p><p>&rsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p><p>Why had he been connected to the sealed god instead of the God of Death?</p><p>And why did it have to be now of all times?</p><p>&rsquo;Furthermore, this bastard knows about how the other gods have interfered.&rsquo;</p><p>That meant that he had realized Choi Han and Dark Tiger Alberu&rsquo;s existences.</p><p>&rsquo;That means he was watching me.&rsquo;</p><p>He had not said anything until now, but he had been watching everything.</p><p>&rsquo;That means that...?!&rsquo;</p><p>The god&rsquo;s voice echoed in his mind again as Cale&rsquo;s eyes clouded over.</p><ul><li>You seem to have realized that this is not your past as well.</li></ul><p>Choi Han had said the following to Cale.</p><p>&rsquo;The God of Death nonchalantly told me something. This is what he said. &rsquo;The sealed god is not able to return to the past, but he is able to push his way into a different dimension.&rsquo; &rsquo;</p><p>Cale had thought that this was probably a different world and not his past after hearing that as well as hearing about Earth 3 from Alberu.</p><p>&ldquo;...A, are you admitting, haaaa, that this is r, reality then? Are you admitting to it?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale barely managed to ask while looking at the air.</p><ul><li>My limit while I am sealed is to throw you into a different dimension.</li></ul><p>The corners of Cale&rsquo;s lips were shaking but curled up after hearing that.</p><p>Choi Han quickly realized that Cale was talking to someone right now after hearing that.</p><p>He realized that it was a god as well.</p><p>Furthermore, he realized that this world was &rsquo;reality&rsquo; and a &rsquo;real&rsquo; world.</p><p>&rsquo;It really was a parallel world.&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han&rsquo;s eyes sparkled before Choi Jung Soo's face suddenly brushed past his mind.</p><p>&rsquo;That punk is not fake, nor a memory, nor even an illusion, but a living breathing person like me.&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han pushed Cale up a bit stronger.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Cale-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>However, Cale's condition was not good as he continued to groan and cough up blood.</p><p>This pain seemed much more painful than any other pain Cale had experienced in the past.</p><p>&ldquo;Huff. Huff. W, why am I like this?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale looked up in the air as he asked.</p><ul><li>Shouldn&rsquo;t I interfere as well since the other gods have each sent one of their children?</li></ul><p>&ldquo;...Is your way of interfering to give me pain?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale barely managed to say the next sentence word by word as he thought about what Choi Han told him.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. I, I thought you couldn&rsquo;t m, mess with the test?&rdquo;</p><p>The God of Death had said something while sending Choi Han here.</p><p>&rsquo;One of the absolute rules for the God of Death is to make a vow of death. Similarly, this sealed god can create tests per his absolute rule, but he cannot mess with the contents of that test.&rsquo;</p><p>He could not mess with the content of the test.</p><p>That was what Choi Han had told Cale.</p><ul><li>Hahahaha!</li></ul><p>The god started to laugh out loud as if he was amused.</p><ul><li>That&rsquo;s right. Child, I am unable to mess with a test that is already in progress.</li></ul><p>In addition...</p><ul><li>You are not my child because you are rejecting me. You have no connections to me whatsoever. I am unable to do anything to you since you are already in the middle of a test.</li></ul><p>Cale looked confused.</p><p>&rsquo;If he can't do anything to me... And he can't mess with the test... What is this pain?&rsquo;</p><ul><li>However, there is a child who wishes to be with me.</li></ul><p>Cale's eyes clouded over after hearing that.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo;</p><p>He started to swear.</p><p>He immediately thought about the person who would want to be with this god.</p><p>The White Star.</p><p>He was certain that it was that bastard.</p><p>And that bastard did not exist here, but in the world with Cale Henituse's body.</p><p>Yes, Cale's body was still on that side.</p><ul><li>The world inside the test is not your only world. I can easily mess with you from the outside as well.</li></ul><p>The god warmly answered, as if he was leisurely teaching Cale something.</p><p>Cale covered his mouth with his hands that were shaking in pain. He started to frown.</p><ul><li>I should use my children to deliver my will as well, shouldn&rsquo;t I?</li></ul><p>&rsquo;What does he mean by, &rsquo;use his children?&rsquo; &rsquo;</p><p>Cale&rsquo;s gaze was firm even though he was in pain.</p><p>"What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>You'll understand after you experience it.</li></ul><p>Boom!</p><p>His heart thumped wildly at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Cale-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>More blood started to drip out of Cale&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>It was so black that it didn't even seem like blood.</p><p>It almost seemed as if it was dead mana.</p><ul><li>Alright, will you be able to overcome this test and your despair?</li></ul><p>The god warmly laughed as he whispered.</p><p>His whisper started to become faint, as if he was slowly disappearing into the fog.</p><ul><li>Flail around inside your despair. When it feels impossible to get out from within your despair...</li></ul><p>The whisper sounded as if the god was offering a sweet deal.</p><ul><li>I will reach my hand out to you. I hope you smile as you grab my hand at that time.</li></ul><p>But for Cale, it was really, truly...</p><ul><li>No, it would probably be more entertaining if you grabbed my hand while you were full of despair.</li></ul><p>It was annoying for him to hear.</p><ul><li>I will be watching with joy.</li></ul><p>The faint voice disappeared and he could not hear the sealed god&rsquo;s voice any longer.</p><p>&ldquo;Haaaaaaaaa. Haaaa.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale was breathing heavily.</p><p>The pain in his body was not going down at all.</p><p>But he stood up straight.</p><p>Click.</p><p>The watch hands were both at 12.</p><p>November 8th, at 12:00:00 am.</p><p>It was the promised time with the God of Death.</p><ul><li>I finally reached you.</li></ul><p>The voice was warm yet cold...<br>Quiet yet firm...</p><p>Making it difficult to tell who was speaking.</p><p>He heard the voice of the God of Death.</p><p>Cale started to smile after hearing the voice echoing in his mind.</p><p>However, he just focused on catching his breath as it was difficult to say anything.</p><ul><li>You were waiting to hear my voice, weren&rsquo;t you?</li></ul><p>The God of Death continued to speak, as if he understood that Cale could not respond right now.</p><ul><li>Cale Henituse, who is also Kim Rok Soo.</li></ul><p>His voice sounded oddly amused.</p><ul><li>I am a god who is incapable of foresight. However, I am able to see one kind of future.</li></ul><p>Cale slowly lowered the hand that had been covering his face while he was chatting with the sealed god.</p><p>The corners of his lips were curled up.</p><p>The God of Death asked him a question.</p><ul><li>Which future do you think I see?</li></ul><p>Cale slowly closed his eyes before opening them back.</p><p>There was only one answer.</p><p>"Death.&rdquo;</p><p>The only human future the God of Death could see was &rsquo;Death.&rsquo;</p><p>The god asked once again.</p><ul><li>Do you remember the opportunity to decide that I gave you?</li></ul><p>Of course, Cale remembered everything that had been written on it, word for word.</p><p>He recalled what had been written on it.</p><p>&lt; Grade 1 ability user Kim Rok Soo. &gt;</p><p>An opportunity to decide given by a god.</p><ul><li>Do you wish to return to your original world?</li></ul><p>Cale had thought that the original world it was talking about was his life as the 36 years old Kim Rok Soo.</p><p>However, right now, on November 8th...</p><p>At this exact moment...</p><p>&ldquo;Or will you die in this world?&rdquo;</p><p>This world was Kim Rok Soo's world.</p><p>That meant the original world was talking about Cale Henituse&rsquo;s world.</p><p>Cale started to laugh even though he was in pain and asked a question.</p><p>&ldquo;God. You must have seen me die today.&rdquo;</p><p>The future that the God of Death could see was the date of a person's death.</p><ul><li>Yes.</li></ul><p>The god laughed as he responded.</p><ul><li>Today, on November 8th...</li></ul><p>Cale had debated about it for a long time.</p><p>What could the God of Death have been trying to tell him?</p><p>Why did he randomly tell him to pick a world?</p><ul><li>Between Kim Rok Soo here and Cale Henituse over there...</li></ul><p>One of the two would die.</p><p>He then had a thought.</p><p>Wouldn't the God of Death only be able to give him an opportunity to decide when he was in front of the crossroads of death?</p><p>In that case, was this the God of Death giving him a hint?</p><p>&rsquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that hint will be beneficial to me or not.&rsquo;</p><p>Choi Han had said something when he came over to this world.</p><p>&rsquo;Miss Cage said that the God of Death needed to make a sacrifice as well. This god is strong even if he is sealed, so the God of Death had to pay a steep price to meddle in that god&rsquo;s test. Don&rsquo;t hate the God of Death too much. That is what Miss Cage said.&rsquo;</p><p>The God of Death had to pay a price to send Choi Han here to help Cale.</p><p>The god asked once again.</p><ul><li>Cale Henituse who is also Kim Rok Soo. I'm sure that you have already prepared for this.</li></ul><p>Cale continued to smile through the pain.</p><p>Today was the day that one of his two identities would die.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, I prepared for it.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu Crossman jumped up from his seat.</p><ul><li>We received a call from Eruhaben-nim!</li></ul><p>Tasha's face looked urgent. The Vampire, Duke Fredo, was standing next to her with a frown on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p><p>Tasha immediately answered Alberu&rsquo;s question.</p><ul><li>He mentioned that something is weird about the inside of the Endable Kingdom! There was suddenly a loud noise!</li></ul><p>She continued to speak.</p><ul><li>Furthermore, the magic shield surrounding the Endable Kingdom has disappeared! We are now able to go into the Endable Kingdom!</li></ul><hr><p>The God of Death asked Cale once more.</p><ul><li>One of the two yous will die today. What did you prepare?</li></ul><p>The corners of Cale&rsquo;s lips twisted up.</p><p>&ldquo;But you see...&rdquo;</p><p>November 8th.</p><p>That day was not the same.</p><p>&ldquo;This place and that place are not having the same November 8th right now.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Pfft.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know about that as well?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Hahaha!</li></ul><p>The god ended up laughing out loud.</p><ul><li>You truly are intelligent. No, you are shrewd.</li></ul><p>The god admitted that Cale was skilled.</p><ul><li>Yes. The time here and the time there flow differently. It is not the same November 8th.</li></ul><p>The today here was not the same as the today there.</p><ul><li>Cale Henituse's November 8th will pass faster than Kim Rok Soo's November 8th.</li></ul><p>The time in Cale Henituse's world was about three times as fast as this world.</p><p>The God of Death sounded happy as he asked.</p><ul><li>It seems as if you want to make me eat shit. Do you think that you will succeed?</li></ul><p>Cale responded while smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;It was written on your letter.&rdquo;</p><p>The God of Death had clearly written it on the letter that told Cale that he had an opportunity to decide.</p><p>&lt; Kim Rok Soo. &gt;</p><p>&lt; You were the one who was supposed to die. &gt;</p><p>&lt; Yes, you were the one who was supposed to die. &gt;</p><p>&lt; However, the world&rsquo;s laws and coincidences... Humans are one of the few existences who can destroy all of those things. &gt;</p><p>&lt; The people who tried to save you broke the law that said that you were supposed to die. &gt;</p><p>&lt; That is why I respect and admire humans. &gt;</p><p>The God of Death had said that he respects and admires humans who broke the world&rsquo;s laws and coincidences.</p><p>&lt; You learned many things from those people and put those lessons to use in your life. &gt;</p><p>&lt; I'm curious to see what your decision will be. &gt;</p><p>The God of Death had already given Cale the answer in advance.</p><p>Cale responded to the gods who were bound to be watching him from who knows where.</p><p>&rsquo;I don&rsquo;t trust the sealed god and I don't trust the God of Death either.&rsquo;</p><p>What he did trust was...</p><p>&ldquo;I trust my friends and I trust myself.&rdquo;</p><p>The God of Death responded as if he was truly happy.</p><ul><li>I knew that a person like you, whose friends made the hands of death fail to take you, would respond that way.</li></ul><p>The god mischievously asked.</p><ul><li>You were probably able to prepare decently thanks to me?</li></ul><p>Cale mischievously answered back.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><hr><ul><li>Your highness! What should we do?</li></ul><p>Alberu turned away for a moment after seeing Tasha's anxious face.</p><p>He looked toward the couch that was past the table with the video communication device.</p><p>People he could call his companions were all there.</p><p>Raon, Rosalyn, Mary, Ron, Beacrox, Lock, Cage, etc were all sitting on the couch looking at him.</p><p>Alberu looked back at them as he recalled what had happened a few days ago.</p><p>It was a short conversation that took place when even Choi Han was not around and it was just Cale and Alberu.</p><p>&rsquo;Your highness, if I am unable to return by November 7th...&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu looked toward the clock.</p><p>The current time was November 8th at 12:00am.</p><p>Cale had said the following.</p><p>If he was unable to return by November 7th...</p><p>&rsquo;For about a day.&rsquo;</p><p>Actually, for exactly a day...</p><p>&rsquo;Please keep me alive.&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu had felt his heart sink when he heard Cale calmly tell him that.</p><p>He had turned toward Cale who was caressing his mane at the time.</p><p>&rsquo;...What do you mean by that?&rsquo;</p><p>He asked that question, but was looking for an answer on his own as well.</p><p>November 8th was the day they were supposed to catch the unranked monster if things went according to plan. But a variable must have come up if that failed.</p><p>That was why Alberu thought that Cale was asking him to be the Dark Tiger and support him to deal with the fall out of that variable.</p><p>&rsquo;You want to fight together?&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu had asked while being slightly concerned.</p><p>&rsquo;Yes, your highness. Let&rsquo;s fight together.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale had continued to calmly respond and caress Alberu's mane.</p><p>Cale&rsquo;s hand appeared and disappeared over and over as he caressed the Dark Tiger's abundant black mane.</p><p>Cale had started at some point to caress Alberu&rsquo;s mane whenever he had the time.</p><p>&rsquo;Dongsaeng, why do you need to be so serious to ask me to fight together?&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right.&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Hmm?&rsquo;</p><p>Alberu had flinched internally at that moment.</p><p>Cale had pretended to caress his mane while writing with his finger that could not be seen.</p><p>His movements were very stealthy, as if he could not let someone see it. Alberu saw that Cale's face was completely calm, as if he was not doing anything.</p><p>Cale was stealthily writing on the skin underneath the Dark Tiger&rsquo;s mane while standing there with a calm expression on his face.</p><p>&lt; In different places. &gt;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s fight together in different places.</p><p>Alberu had barely managed to keep his expression from changing.</p><p>He was acting stealthily. He knew that he had to do so since he saw how Cale was moving so that nobody could see what he was doing.</p><p>Cale was only telling Alberu about this.</p><p>He continued to leisurely caress the mane again, as if he never did anything else, before he continued to speak.</p><p>&rsquo;We need to all survive. Everybody should survive without dying.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale&rsquo;s hand that was hidden underneath the mane again stealthily wrote something else.</p><p>&lt; Definitely. &gt;</p><p>Everybody must definitely survive and not die.</p><p>Alberu gave a short response to everything Cale had just asked.</p><p>&rsquo;Let&rsquo;s make sure to fight together.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale had then laughed, as if he was very happy.</p><p>That had happened a few days ago.</p><p>Alberu snapped out of his thoughts and started to speak.</p><p>Although they were in different places...</p><p>&rsquo;Today, we will fight together.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We only have one goal.&rdquo;</p><p>All of his companions looked toward Alberu.</p><p>Alberu was speaking not as the crown prince, but as Cale Henituse's sworn brother today.</p><p>&ldquo;We will definitely keep Cale Henituse alive for the whole day.&rdquo;</p><p>Alberu, who was wearing his armor, picked up his helmet.</p><p>&ldquo;We will also not die either.&rdquo;</p><p>In the quiet area where nobody was saying anything...</p><p>Alberu asked his companions a question.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you understand?&rdquo;</p><p>Their gazes had already given him their responses.</p><hr><p>Cale grabbed Choi Han's shoulder as he was being supported.</p><p>Choi Han would not have heard the gods&rsquo; voices, but he would have heard everything Cale had said. He was the person Cale could trust the most right now.</p><ul><li>I'll be watching you.</li></ul><p>On top of the quiet watchtower now that the God of Death's voice was gone...</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, hyung-nim.&rdquo;<br>"Do you see that?&rdquo;</p><p>In the distance...</p><p>They could see something large approaching them through the fog with its head up.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I can see it.&rdquo;</p><p>The yellow head had shown itself once again.</p><p>Beeeeeeeeep- Beeeeeeeeeeeep-</p><p>An alarm echoed throughout the castle, breaking the night of rest at the Seomyeon shelter.</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, hyung-nim.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Until 8 am...&rdquo;</p><p>A day for Cale Henituse would be about 8-10 hours for Kim Rok Soo.</p><p>&ldquo;Keeping everybody here alive. That is my goal.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han looked at his shoulder.</p><p>Cale's voice was calm, but his hand that was on Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulder was still shaking quite a bit.</p><p>&rsquo;The pain is still there.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale was barely keeping himself together with his amazing perseverance.</p><p>Choi Han knew that was it.</p><p>That was why he pushed aside the things that Cale had said into the air, most likely to the gods, to a corner of his mind.</p><p>He then focused on what he needed to do.</p><p>He grabbed Cale&rsquo;s shoulder to support him as he responded.</p><p>&ldquo;I will be with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale started to smile again.</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Let&rsquo;s do this.&rdquo;</p><p>It would be an extremely blood-drying 8 hours, but...</p><p>It was worth trying.</p> <a href="./chapter601.html" class="chapter-nav">
