<p>The moment Cale thought that this testing ground might be a real world...</p><p>He started to think.</p><p>&rsquo;If this is a different world and I need to leave this place to return home...&rsquo;</p><p>Then there was only one answer.</p><p>&rsquo;Let's teach them.&rsquo;</p><p>Teach the people here how to do it.</p><p>Originally, the twenty years old Kim Rok Soo was pretty useless.</p><p>However, as he passed 25, 30, and then 35, Kim Rok Soo became a decent person.</p><p>He had grown.</p><p>If even he had grown, what if these people who were supposed to die here ended up surviving and growing?</p><p>&rsquo;They&rsquo;ll all be better than me.&rsquo;</p><p>Just thinking about it was making him laugh.</p><p>That was what Cale wanted.</p><p>For that reason, he had started this first lesson.</p><p>"Screeeech- screeeeeeech!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale moved even faster toward the 3-meter tall mummy-like skeleton monster charging toward him.</p><p>Jang Man Soo had barely managed to crawl over to the ledge and peeked out while holding onto the railing.</p><p>He could see the wind surrounding Cale and the reddish-gold light in his hands.</p><p>But Jang Man Soo started to shout.</p><p>&ldquo;Rok Soo! Dodge!&rdquo;</p><p>He could see a black animal charging toward Cale.</p><p>The black snake wolf.</p><p>Jang Man Soo had seen people being eaten by this black wolf that was covered in snakeskin.</p><p>He had also heard that people who said goodbye to him as they went hunting were squashed by that bastard&rsquo;s front paw.</p><p>That bastard was a source of fear and hell.</p><p>Kim Rok Soo looked too weak and tiny compared to this house-sized snake wolf.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>The black snake wolf charged at him from the right with its jaw open.</p><p>Jang Man Soo&rsquo;s eyes opened and his hands that were holding the railing started to shake.</p><p>&rsquo;No.&rsquo;</p><p>Kim Rok Soo could not die.</p><p>&ldquo;Rok Soo--!&rdquo;</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>Jang Man Soo shouted as he heard a loud explosion.</p><p>A lot of dust shot up.</p><p>However, the dust soon subsided.</p><p>Jang Man Soo subconsciously opened his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;...A shield?&rdquo;</p><p>A silver shield with two wings open was blocking the black wolf.</p><p>&ldquo;...Holy crap. How many powers does this son of a bitch have?&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Park Jin Tae mumbling, but Jang Man Soo could not say anything.</p><p>The shield was small compared to his shield.</p><p>It was only big enough to block the black wolf's face and front paw.</p><p>But the way it was being used was different.</p><p>At least, that&rsquo;s how Jang Man Soo felt.</p><p>Kim Rok Soo was not using the shield to block the enemy, but so that he could keep moving forward.</p><p>Jang Man Soo made eye contact with Cale who was on the other side of the shield.</p><p>He might be wrong, but it seemed as if Rok Soo was looking at him.</p><p>It was as if he was teaching him that this was how to use a shield even though he was in the middle of a battle.</p><p>It was as if he was showing how to do it.</p><p>&ldquo;...Did I make a mistake?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo;</p><p>Jang Man Soo looked toward Park Jin Tae. But Park Jin Tae was not looking at him. He was speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s obviously using the shield like that for you to see, Mr. Jang Man Soo! Isn&rsquo;t that obvious?&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae stopped talking for a moment.</p><p>He still couldn&rsquo;t take his eyes off the rose-gold light in Cale&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Crazy bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae realized that the pressure flowing out of Cale had disappeared at some point.</p><p>However, his hand was still full of sweat.</p><p>&ldquo;Screeeech!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale, who had been looking at Jang Man Soo, started to walk again.</p><p>Craaaaaaack-</p><p>His shield slowly started to crack.</p><p>This Indestructible Shield was not even at half power after all.</p><p>&ldquo;...And I can&rsquo;t overdo it.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale wasn't using all of his powers.</p><p>Efficiency was the most important thing right now.</p><p>Swoooooooosh-</p><p>Cale rode the wind and shot forward before the shield broke.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooooooooooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>The wolf&rsquo;s roar echoed in Cale's ear.</p><p>Someone landed on the roof at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Huff, huff! I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;</p><p>It was Bae Puh Rum.</p><p>Kim Min Ah walked over to Bae Puh Rum. To be more specific, she had walked over to her brother who was on his back.</p><p>"Oppa!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mr. Kim Min Joon.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han also walked over to Kim Min Joon and made eye contact with him.</p><p>Kim Min Ah flinched for a moment before stepping back. It was because she saw Grandma Kim standing behind Choi Han.</p><p>&ldquo;I will get started.&rdquo;</p><p>Grandma Kim immediately put her hand on Kim Min Joon's infected wound.</p><p>A bright light surrounded his wound.</p><p>They heard a sharp voice at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Screeeeeech!&rdquo;</p><p>The skeleton covered in bandages swung its arms at Cale.</p><p>Swoooooooosh-</p><p>The bandages on both of its arms instantly turned into sharp whips that struck down to split Cale in half.</p><p>The movement was elaborate.</p><p>However, there were no openings. Actually, even if there were any openings, they would only last a few short seconds. It swung its bandage whips around before striking down at Cale.</p><p>Park Jin Tae bit down on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;...Those damn bandages-&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae who had escaped from that monster in the past to survive started to frown.</p><p>He heard Choi Han&rsquo;s voice at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Three steps to the left.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...What the hell are-&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae's eyes opened wide.</p><p>Cale quickly took three steps to the left.</p><p>&ldquo;The blind spot of the two arm bandage attack.&rdquo;</p><p>Everybody looked toward Choi Han at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Please look at Rok Soo hyung. I'm just repeating what he told me.&rdquo;</p><p>They heard Lee Chul Min&rsquo;s voice at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;My goodness! It really is a blind spot!&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae&rsquo;s eyes opened wide as he quickly looked back at Cale.</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s as Choi Han, no, as Kim Rok Soo said!&rsquo;</p><p>Three steps to the left.</p><p>An area where the bandage whips could not reach was there.</p><p>&ldquo;Five steps forward.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale then quickly took five steps forward. He mumbled the things he had told Choi Han.</p><p>Choi Han continued to speak as well.</p><p>"The bandage monster will raise its left arm.&rdquo;<br>"The bandage monster will raise its left arm.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a pattern.</p><p>It was a monster&rsquo;s unchanging pattern that all monsters Grade 1 and lower had.</p><p>Cale could see the bandage monster raise its left arm.</p><p>&ldquo;The first weakness. The left armpit.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale could see a red rock in the spot of the bandage monster&rsquo;s armpit when it raised its arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Aim.&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae was hearing Choi Han's voice, but it felt as if Kim Rok Soo was talking to him.</p><p>That was not it.</p><p>It was actually Kim Rok Soo.</p><p>Choi Han was sharing Kim Rok Soo&rsquo;s will.</p><p>Choi Han continued to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Fire.&rdquo;</p><p>The moment Park Jin Tae saw the bandage monster raise its arm... He saw a rose gold light shooting toward its left armpit.</p><p>It looked like a gun.</p><p>Park Jin Tae subconsciously took his gun out of his pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;First weakness destroyed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Screeeech-!&rdquo;</p><p>He heard the monster&rsquo;s scream and Choi Han's voice at the same time.</p><p>Park Jin Tae&rsquo;s eyes were still focused on Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;Screeech, kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!&rdquo;</p><p>The screeching monster looked toward Cale.</p><p>Sharp thorns shot out from on top of the bones that had been covered by the bandages and headed for Cale.</p><p>However, Cale was not there.</p><p>&ldquo;Move through the legs.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale&rsquo;s body was already passing through the monster&rsquo;s skeleton legs.</p><p>Park Jin Tae got the chills seeing him move so boldly.</p><p>Who would ever think about moving through a Grade 1 monster&rsquo;s legs?</p><p>Especially a monster that swung bandage whips all around itself!</p><p>&rsquo;But Kim Rok Soo managed to do it.&rsquo;</p><p>He passed through the legs as if he was lying down and sliding through before raising his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;The second weakness.&rdquo;</p><p>He would quickly take care of this monster.</p><p>&ldquo;Inside the right thigh.&rdquo;</p><p>Crack, crackle!</p><p>The Fire of Destruction, two strands of its fiery thunderbolt struck the leg bone by its thigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Explode!&rdquo;</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>The fiery thunderbolts exploded. The skeleton monster&rsquo;s screaming shook the area.</p><p>&ldquo;Screeeeeeeeeeeeech---!&rdquo;</p><p>Its eyes inside the skull turned red.</p><p>&ldquo;Approaching berserk state.&rdquo;</p><p>This was a unique trait of the skeleton monster.</p><p>It would immediately enter berserk state once the second weakness was attacked and become twice as strong.</p><p>That was why this bastard was scary.</p><p>&rsquo;If you don&rsquo;t know about it that is.&rsquo;</p><p>But if you knew about it?</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s very easy.&rsquo;</p><p>The skeleton monster turned around.</p><p>Cale started to laugh.</p><p>He could see Park Jin Tae standing on the roof and looking at him with a focused gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Good, he&rsquo;s paying attention.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale quickly moved to the right.</p><p>Choi Han continued to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;The black snake wolf&rsquo;s second attack.&rdquo;</p><p>The black wolf to the right jumped over the skeleton and charged for Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;Aim for the ankle.&rdquo;</p><p>Fire.</p><p>The fourth fiery thunderbolt pierced through the black wolf&rsquo;s right ankle.</p><p>Its skin was like a snake.</p><p>However, its weakness was fire.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>The wolf roared as its body leaned to one side.</p><p>Choi Han continued to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Jump.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale kicked off the ground. He stepped on the wolf&rsquo;s head and his body shot up.</p><p>Then he was able to make eye contact with the bandage monster.</p><p>&ldquo;Screeeech-!!&rdquo;</p><p>He made eye contact with the skeleton monster that was swinging its bandages and thorny bones while looking at him.</p><p>The moment he looked into those eyes...</p><p>&ldquo;Fire the last bullets.&rdquo;</p><p>Choi Han made a comment. The word &rsquo;bullet&rsquo; etched itself in Park Jin Tae&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>The rose gold thunderbolts struck the skeleton's two eyes.</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>They were not strong enough to destroy the skeleton's head.</p><p>They were only strong enough to cause explosions where the monster&rsquo;s eyes should be.</p><p>Cale used the explosion to move and his body rolled on the ground.</p><p>The skeleton monster&rsquo;s last weakness was its eyes that had turned red.</p><p>It was a critical weakness that only appeared once it went berserk.</p><p>The skeleton monster&rsquo;s body started to tilt without even being able to scream.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooooooooooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>The skeleton monster&rsquo;s body was starting to fall on the black wolf.</p><p>The black wolf that had one ankle ripped off was doing its best to dodge the skeleton's body.</p><p>It was because there was fire coming out of where the skeleton's red eyes had exploded.</p><p>The black snake wolf that had snake skin could not let that fire touch its body.</p><p>However, Choi Han's voice reached Jang Man Soo's ears at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Use the shield.&rdquo;</p><p>A silver shield blocked the black snake wolf's path.</p><p>The snake wolf could not move forward. And on top of it...</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooooooooooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>A burning skeleton head, its sharp thorny bones, and bandages that would easily catch fire fell on the snake wolf.</p><p>Baaaaaaaaaang-!</p><p>Fire shot up.</p><p>The people on the roof heard Choi Han&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I only managed to memorize the first battle. Rok Soo hyung will tell you about the rest.&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae, Jang Man Soo, Kim Min Ah, and the others all looked away from the burning monsters and at Cale who was heading back to the building.</p><p>&rsquo;C, crazy bastard!&rsquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae&rsquo;s voice was shaking.</p><p>He couldn't even think straight long enough to try to hide it.</p><p>How long had it been?</p><p>How long had it taken him to take down those two monsters?</p><p>It didn't seem to take very long.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae&rsquo;s hands were shaking.</p><p>&rsquo;I feel like I could do it.&rsquo;</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>He felt as if he could take down the bandage monster. He felt as if he could take down the black snake wolf as well.</p><p>&rsquo;As long as I'm with Jang Man Soo that is.&rsquo;</p><p>He turned toward Jang Man Soo.</p><p>Jang Man Soo's hands were shaking as well. Jang Man Soo started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Umm, umm, hey, Jin Tae. Don&rsquo;t you think we could take care of the bandage monster and snake wolf when the Grade 1 monsters come to attack?&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae chuckled while looking at Jang Man Soo who was speaking while looking at him with an awkward expression. That was all he could do.</p><p>He felt as if he could take down these monster bastards that he had run away from all this time as Jang Man Soo said.</p><p>&rsquo;Of course, we don't have the experience.&rsquo;</p><p>It was not easy to move around while attacking the monsters following the pattern with proper timing as Kim Rok Soo had done.</p><p>It would only be possible if they trained over and over to make that pattern feel normal.</p><p>&rsquo;But Kim Rok Soo did it.&rsquo;</p><p>Was it possible?</p><p>Could a person move like that because they had foresight and used data?</p><p>&rsquo;...He couldn&rsquo;t do it without a ton of experience.&rsquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae could not believe it.</p><p>He quietly looked at the approaching Kim Rok Soo.</p><p>However, Cale, who had memorized these patterns as if they were his own instincts and had tons of experience that Park Jin Tae did not know about, let out a small sigh.</p><p>&rsquo;My body is weak.&rsquo;</p><p>His body felt slow compared to when he had been team leader Kim Rok Soo. He was weak.</p><p>He didn't have enough muscles.</p><p>Even the ancient powers that weren&rsquo;t even at half strength were difficult for this body to handle.</p><p>&rsquo;But I was still able to fight pretty easily.&rsquo;</p><p>Drip.</p><p>Cale wiped away the small amount of blood at the corner of his lip and looked up at the roof.</p><p>A corner of Park Jin Tae&rsquo;s lips was up as he looked down at Cale with an odd expression. Cale chuckled at Park Jin Tae and started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum.&rdquo;</p><p>He sounded extremely calm, as if he had just come back from a walk.</p><p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum looked at Cale.</p><p>They weren't the only ones.</p><p>Everybody inside the building was looking at Cale through the windows or on the roof.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>They heard two more monsters approaching, but they were still focused on Cale.</p><p>Cale quietly took in their gazes and started to speak as if that was easy to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Come down. I'll teach you guys something this time.&rdquo;</p> <a href="./chapter565.html" class="chapter-nav">
