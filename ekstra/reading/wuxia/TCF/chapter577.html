<p>&ldquo;Gasp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu sat up as soon as he took a breath.</p>
<p>He could see someone looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Ca...ge?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, it is me, your highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Cage were looking at him with nervous gazes from the other side of the couch Alberu had been lying on.</p>
<p>Alberu slowly looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...This is driving me crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Cage flinched after hearing the first words he said after waking up, but Alberu did not have time to focus on them.</p>
<p>He had woken up while he was fighting.</p>
<p>He had just been biting monsters apart in the body of a monster named the Dark Tiger until he opened his eyes only to suddenly find himself back here.</p>
<p>Sunlight was coming in through the tent entrance.</p>
<p>The sunlight was red.</p>
<p>Cage quietly started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is evening now, your highness.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s already that late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu thought for a moment and mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Two times as fast? Or is it three?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head at Cage's question. Alberu then noticed the curiosity behind the two priests&rsquo; eyes as they looked at him.</p>
<p>&rsquo;I'm sure they want to know how Cale and Choi Han are doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alberu looked down toward his stomach.</p>
<p>The half-black-half-white video communication device was sitting there.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has nothing else happened while I was sleeping?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, your highness. There wasn&rsquo;t even a call to the emergency line because you prepared everything prior to falling asleep.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage and Jack carefully observed the calmly responding Alberu.</p>
<p>He was calm, but his body was covered in sweat.</p>
<p>That was why Cage had wondered whether she should wake him up prior to the discussed time.</p>
<p>They did not do so as he looked peaceful other than the fact that he was sweating so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Your highness. The contents of the deal-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened his hand toward Cage to stop her from speaking.</p>
<p>The two priests didn&rsquo;t know because they were faced away from it, but there was a small amount of red sunset coming in from the tent entrance.</p>
<p>It was obvious what that meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please come in, Raon-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He couldn't see Raon but the entrance flap lifted a little more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meeeeeow.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Meeow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two kittens walked in first and then the tent entrance was tightly closed before the young black Dragon revealed himself.</p>
<p>"Crown prince!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, Raon-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raon, On, and Hong.</p>
<p>The three of the slightly lifted Alberu's tent entrance flap every so often to signal whether it was okay for them to enter.</p>
<p>Even though Ron and Beacrox were taking care of the three of them, they were both busy managing the Molan household and taking care of things here.</p>
<p>Maybe that was the reason...</p>
<p>Or maybe it was for cookies...</p>
<p>It might even be because they wanted to hear some news about Cale and Choi Han, but...</p>
<p>The three of them came to look for Alberu every so often.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, crown prince! Are you sick?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Oh no, it's bad if he gets sick, nya!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...He needs to rest, nya, it&rsquo;s probably because he hasn&rsquo;t been able to rest, nya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three didn&rsquo;t find it difficult to talk to Alberu.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because they've seen him frequently since they were young.</p>
<p>&rsquo;No. It's because they&rsquo;re like Cale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These three were probably imitating Cale who acted rudely around him all the time.</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu&rsquo;s lips went up just a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm okay, Raon-nim.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Of course, Raon-nim. In fact, I'm doing quite well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu started to think while looking at the young Dragon and the young Cats who seemed relieved after hearing what he just said.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Do I tell them or not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Would he tell them about Cale and Choi Han, or would he remain silent? Alberu was debating what to do.</p>
<p>But he didn't need to think for long.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Your highness. No, hyung-nim.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;What is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He recalled a short portion of the conversation he had with Cale while they were moving.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Hyung-nim, you&rsquo;ll keep coming and going to see me, right?&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Yes?&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Then it is probably best not to tell them everything and instead just give them a brief positive explanation. Keep things positive, you know? It&rsquo;s a simple request, right?&rdquo;<br>
&rsquo;...You motherfucker. That's difficult to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to a deal I made with the Sun God earlier, I am now able to chat with Cale Henituse every so often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raon&rsquo;s round eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Hong who was putting his paw into the cookie basket stopped moving while On looked frozen stiff as she was looking at Alberu.</p>
<p>Saint Jack urgently started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your highness. If you tell them about all of that-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu confidently responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay since he&rsquo;s doing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His expression and tone... Everything was calm and confident.</p>
<p>Maybe that was the reason...</p>
<p>&ldquo;He also asked if you, Raon-nim, and On, and Hong were doing well. He asked if you were eating properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children averaging nine-years-old gathered together before their expressions brightened.</p>
<p>Cage, who also looked much better, started to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, is he really fine?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes. You don&rsquo;t need to worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a small smile on Alberu&rsquo;s face as he responded without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Alberu's gentle expression made everybody look even more relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey crown prince, crown prince!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, Raon-nim.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Can I tell grandpa Ron and Beacrox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu gently nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but please just quietly tell Ron Molan and bring Beacrox and Ron over here. I think I&rsquo;ll need to explain it to the two of them.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I got it!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Oh, and please don't tell the others about it yet. I'll call them over separately and tell them myself.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I got it, crown prince!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raon looked at On who nodded her head and quickly headed toward the tent entrance with Hong and Raon.</p>
<p>On then suddenly stopped, turned around and bowed toward the crown prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, your highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>She always spoke informally and added, &rsquo;nya,&rsquo; so he thought that was her style, but she seemed quite mature just now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;m thankful too, crown prince!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I'm thankful, nya! I'll pay you back for it, nya!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu gently responded after hearing Raon and Hong as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was nothing. I didn&rsquo;t do much, Raon-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children averaging nine-years-old looked even more relieved after seeing his demeanor and energetically exited the tent. They seemed excited that they had a mission to complete for the first time in a long while.</p>
<p>Alberu quietly observed them before turning toward Cage and Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that you two could bring some people over as well, priest-nims.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ah, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saint Jack urgently jumped up from his seat. He had a bright expression on his face.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cage&rsquo;s expression that had been bright until a moment ago seemed a bit odd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Who should we bring over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak to respond to her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please bring Miss Rosalyn. Ah, Saint-nim, could you please bring your sister?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir! Of course. I will go and quickly bring Hannah over.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful. Thank you very much. It looks like we will all need to have our first meeting in a long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saint Jack slightly bowed to Cage and Alberu and headed out of the tent.</p>
<p>Cage slowly followed behind him. She stopped at the entrance once Jack left and turned around to look at Alberu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage hesitated for a moment before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tend to be pretty sharp because I've been to a lot of places. That is why... Really-&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not continue to speak.</p>
<p>This was what she wanted to ask.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Really, is young master Cale-nim really okay? Your expression seems kind of fake, your highness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she could not ask her question.</p>
<p>It was because Alberu started to speak as she stood there unable to finish her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fine. Those punks are fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cage closed her mouth after hearing his response. She then bowed and left the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will quickly bring Miss Rosalyn over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu was now left alone in the tent once Cage left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huuuuuu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu brushed his face with both hands.</p>
<p>He could feel that his hair was still wet with sweat.</p>
<p>The disgusting feel of it made Alberu start to frown as he recalled what Cale said again.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Then it is probably best not to tell them everything and just give them a brief positive explanation. Keep things positive, you know? It&rsquo;s a simple request, right?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Keep things positive, you know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those words kept echoing in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That damn bastard. He's pushing all the difficult things to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu could not stop frowning.</p>
<p>Keep things positive?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I make any of that positive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberu recalled the night on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Fires, explosions...</p>
<p>The night was full of madness.</p>
<p>Alberu could not stop frowning while thinking about the two punks who were at the center of it all.</p>
<hr>
<p>Park Jin Tae raised his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Kim Rok Soo!&rdquo;<br>
"What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae started to frown at Cale&rsquo;s short response.</p>
<p>"Ah, this bastard is just going to speak informally to me now all the time, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then raised his voice again and shouted loud enough for Kim Rok Soo to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Y, your hyung-nim is acting weird!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale created an opening and looked behind him.</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger had a somewhat blank expression on its face. The Dark Tiger made eye contact with Cale at that moment and Cale shouted toward it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take down all the monsters in your way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a flash in the Dark Tiger's eyes and it quietly started to move its large body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Park Jin Tae! You fight too!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Man, people are going to think I am taking a break or something. Do you know how hard-!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Cale had already turned his head back and resumed fighting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae frowned before touching the gun in his hand.</p>
<p>His fingers were slightly shaking.</p>
<p>His body was full of minor injuries and he was bleeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So annoying. It&rsquo;s so annoying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was still dark.</p>
<p>The sun was not coming up.</p>
<p>Everywhere around him was full of the stench of blood.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It was full of the monsters&rsquo; disgusting body fluids.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>He turned his gaze.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah moved past him.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked to the side.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah had pierced a monster that had tried to ambush Park Jin Tae from the side.</p>
<p>It was a Grade 1 monster.</p>
<p>It was a snake-headed giant, the same monster that Cale taught Kim Min Ah to fight against earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...So damn strong.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I've always been strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah said something else as she moved past Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I only recently learned how to fight properly. Isn't that the same for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the case.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae realized it as he learned how to fight properly as well.</p>
<p>Even though he was surrounded by chaos, blood, and madness...</p>
<p>He could feel it.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...Humans can win!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was getting faster and faster at dealing with the Grade 1 monsters by following Kim Rok Soo's data.</p>
<p>The people Kim Rok Soo had designated as the attack team were slowly starting to get a feel for their potential.</p>
<p>They were getting stronger, unlike these monsters.</p>
<p>It was worth trying.</p>
<p>They could win.</p>
<p>That was why they could not stop.</p>
<p>Even though this fucking night was so damn long...</p>
<p>Nobody could stop.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae&rsquo;s finger pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>A bullet flew into a monster&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>Ever since the cataclysm and the discovery of abilities... His shooting skills that had regressed for some reason were slowly returning again.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-!</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae turned after hearing a loud noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roooooar!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Grr- grrrrr!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsters were falling down as a shining black light shot up between them.</p>
<p>It was quite far away, but it was the only thing clearly visible in the darkness.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>There was a person whose body was surrounded in rose gold current next to the shining black light.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the person dressed in white was visible thanks to that rose gold light as well, and Joo Ho-Shik, the person dressed in white, clenched his hands together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have faith!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;So fucking crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae swore as he laughed after hearing the voice.</p>
<p>Those three people... No, those two people...</p>
<p>Choi Han and Kim Rok Soo...</p>
<p>He could see these two people fighting no matter where they were.</p>
<p>It was because of that rose gold current.</p>
<p>They were too visible in this battlefield full of Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters and Grade 1 monsters as well.</p>
<p>That was why he could not stop.</p>
<p>That was also the reason that Cale could not stop.</p>
<p>He knew that people all around them were looking at him and Choi Han.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huff, huff. How much time has passed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could hear Joo Ho-Shik's heavy breathing behind him.</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik who had been shouting, &rsquo;I have faith!&rsquo; over and over was sticking to Choi Han and Cale to provide them significant support.</p>
<p>Cale had a watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not have time to look at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roooooooooooooooar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale moved after looking at three Grade 1 monsters charging toward him.</p>
<p>2 meters to the left, and then backward in the 5 o&rsquo;clock direction.</p>
<p>Then a thunderbolt to the front.</p>
<p>Crackle!</p>
<p>A small rose gold thunderbolt struck the monster&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Slash, slash.</p>
<p>Choi Han's sword slashed two other Grade 1 monsters.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han asked and Cale responded while laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask that after you catch your breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han had been slowly breathing heavier since a bit earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyung, you&rsquo;re in much worse condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han stood in front of Cale and made it so that Cale could not keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Choi Han was correct.</p>
<p>Cale could tell that he was in terrible condition.</p>
<p>His hands were slightly shaking. There was dry blood by his mouth.</p>
<p>He was also turning pale.</p>
<p>&rsquo;But it's still bearable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He would not faint.</p>
<p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s all thanks to Joo Ho-Shik.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik's &rsquo;faith&rsquo; was surprisingly able to amplify Cale&rsquo;s ancient powers and Choi Han&rsquo;s aura.</p>
<p>Actually, for some odd reason, Joo Ho-Shik's ability actually supported Cale and Choi Han better than the others.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Does Joo Ho-Shik have more faith in me and Choi Han?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik's ability changed strength based on the level of faith.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Why would he feel that way?</p>
<p>Cale had many questions, but he chose to listen to what was going on rather than thinking about that again.</p>
<p>He could hear it.</p>
<p>He could hear the monsters&rsquo; cries.</p>
<p>But there was definitely less than before.</p>
<p>The fire and explosions destroyed most of the Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters and the Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters that had suddenly been ambushed while they were resting were unable to move quickly because of their large bodies and had their weaknesses attacked by the humans.</p>
<p>This ambush was a success.</p>
<p>However, there were still too many of them.</p>
<p>Monsters kept appearing no matter how many times they slashed and killed.</p>
<p>It was especially difficult because of the Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters that became 1.5 times stronger from madness.</p>
<p>They were so crazy that they continued to charge forward even after receiving injuries that would normally make them become afraid, fall, or run away.</p>
<p>That stopping would make things a bit easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haaaaa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale sighed as he started to think.</p>
<p>&rsquo;When. When will the sun rise? If the sun came up...&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then humans would become the predators instead of the prey.</p>
<p>Cale started to think about Joo Ho-Shik who had asked him the time and Park Jin Tae who had seemed a bit out of it.</p>
<p>He could then feel that the people were starting to slow down.</p>
<p>Even if the people he had gathered for this attack had grown at rapid speed and showed their talents...</p>
<p>Those people were starting to get tired.</p>
<p>They were almost out of strength.</p>
<p>They couldn't help it.</p>
<p>They were not used to such a long battle.</p>
<p>That was why he could not get tired yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choi Han.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, hyung-nim?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;The black Yong. Can you use it one more time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike Choi Han's shining black aura, the black Yong required Choi Han to use a lot of strength. That was why he was fighting with his aura right now.</p>
<p>But Cale could read the mood of the battlefield.</p>
<p>As the others are getting tired...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Then please use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They needed to show those people the strength of their allies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huuuuuu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han took a deep breath before pointing his sword toward the sky.</p>
<p>Black aura started to gather around his sword and slowly started to take the form of a black Yong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Joo Ho-Shik. Please use your ability on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han flinched after hearing Cale&rsquo;s statement, but he stayed still as he could not break his concentration.</p>
<p>Cale gathered fiery thunderbolts into both of his hands as Joo Ho-Shik shouted.</p>
<p>Cale could feel his fiery thunderbolts becoming stronger thanks to Joo Ho-Shik's ability.</p>
<p>He would use his fiery thunderbolts along with Choi Han&rsquo;s black Yong to sweep through the battlefield.</p>
<p>Then the Grade 1 monsters should retreat back and the allies would feel revitalized.</p>
<p>Cale had such thoughts as he started to look toward the tip of Choi Han's sword that was pointed to the air.</p>
<p>That would be where the black Yong would soon open its jaw and charge through the battlefield.</p>
<p>But the moment he raised his head...</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>He reached out and grabbed Choi Han&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>...Hyung?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly commented as Choi Han flinched in response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun is coming up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night sky was slowly starting to get brighter.</p>
<p>Night had passed and dawn was approaching.</p>
<p>"We did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale added on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We passed the crucial moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale looked around at the evidence of the fierce battle.</p>
<p>He could see the madness disappearing from the Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters as the world became brighter.</p>
<p>The weakened Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters slowly started to retreat.</p>
<p>Cale had a record in his memories.</p>
<p>&lt; Once the night passed, the Grade 2 and Grade 3 would no longer be crazy and would stop attacking the central shelters. &gt;<br>
&lt; They could no longer attack, as it was now the Grade 1 monsters' turn to attack. &gt;<br>
&lt; This was a rule that was followed at all original central shelters that were attacked. &gt;</p>
<p>Cale's gaze reached the Grade 1 monsters.</p>
<p>There were still many Grade 1 monsters that were alive.</p>
<p>But the crazy Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters, humans, and leader monsters... Along with the fire and explosions... The chaos created by all sorts of things managed to kill many Grade 1 monsters.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae, Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum, Bae Cheol-Ho, Che Soo Jung, etc.</p>
<p>He could see all of them.</p>
<p>They all looked tired.</p>
<p>They looked up at the sky that was lighting up before looking toward Cale.</p>
<p>Cale smiled toward them.</p>
<p>It was a smile that let them know that they had won, that they had survived.</p>
<p>He then said the following.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s finish the rest and head toward our new base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody laughed and tightly clenched their weapons with shaking hands.</p> <a href="./chapter576.html" class="chapter-nav">
