That was why Cale immediately traveled to the Forest of Darkness.</p><p>&ldquo;Y, young master-nim, I will take the lead!&rdquo;</p><p>Hilsman moved forward after seeing the entrance of the Forest of Darkness. However, he could see two people looking at him with blank expressions.<br>One was Cale while the other was Eruhaben.<br>However, another existence helped Hilsman relax a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! Vice Captain, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p><p>It was Raon.<br>Raon stopped being invisible and urged Hilsman forward with a smile. Hilsman started to smile as well. However, Cale quickly interjected.</p><p>&ldquo;Hilsman, have you ever been to the center of the Forest of Darkness?&rdquo;</p><p>The Vice Captain had trained in the outer regions of the Forest of Darkness last winter with the ten Wolf children.</p><p>&ldquo;I have followed Choi Han there once! Please trust me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale waved for Hilsman to hurry up and move. Hilsman nodded his head and started to walk.</p><p>Cale leisurely followed behind him and looked to the side. Eruhaben had been quiet since earlier.</p><p>&ldquo;Is something wrong Eruhaben-nim?&rdquo;</p><p>Eruhaben looked toward Cale and started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;You also have 10 Blue Wolf Tribe children?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Hans was currently staying in Harris Village with the ten Wolf children after having returned from the Ubarr territory. They all welcomed Cale&rsquo;s unexpected visit.</p><p>The Gold Dragon started to mumble.</p><p>&ldquo;...Six ancient powers, all sorts of Beast people, and even multiple strong humans. What an exhausting way to live.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale was suddenly at a loss for words. Now that he thought about it, he was indeed living an exhausting life.</p><p>&ldquo;Tsk. Tsk.&rdquo;</p><p>Eruhaben shook his head and clicked his tongue. He observed Cale&rsquo;s expression turning complicated as he started to think.</p><p>&rsquo;This punk has a difficult life if you think about it.&rsquo;</p><p>Eruhaben had heard everything about the secret organization.</p><p>He wondered if a god had given this human punk all sorts of ancient powers to help him out since Cale seemed to get involved in all sorts of messes wherever he went.</p><p>The Gold Dragon felt a bit of pity for the human in front of him.</p><p>Of course, he did not know that it was not an act of god but Cale&rsquo;s own decision to gather all of these things. The Beast people, the ancient powers, and the human experts, Cale had done all of it himself.</p><p>There was no way that the Gold Dragon would know about that.</p><p>Eruhaben, who was currently having the wrong idea about Cale&rsquo;s life, could hear Raon starting to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;But it is fine because the weak human has me! He has the great and mighty Raon Miru!&rdquo;</p><p>Raon seemed extremely pleased with himself.<br>The Gold Dragon ignored Raon and started to speak to Cale, who still seemed to be deep in thought.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re working so hard.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale nodded his head.</p><p>&ldquo;...Seems that way. I need to quickly finish everything.&rdquo;</p><p>He needed to finish everything so that he could play. So that he could roll around on his bed and sleep all he wants.<br>Cale&rsquo;s desire for the slacker life started to get bigger and bigger.</p><p>The Ancient Dragon who had lived close to 1,000 years casually remarked after seeing the human thinking about his fate.</p><p>&ldquo;You can tell me about what is bothering you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Really?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale&rsquo;s pupils turned hazy for a moment before returning to normal.</p><p>Eruhaben clicked his tongue and nodded his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Tsk tsk, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale started to think that Eruhaben would help him out at least once.</p><p>Cale started to smile. The Gold Dragon felt better, thinking that the human was happy about what he had just said.</p><p>However, one person in the group was feeling something else.</p><p>&ldquo;...Young master-nim.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...The monsters are weird.&rdquo;</p><p>The monsters at the edge of the forest were acting weird.</p><p>Kiiiiiii- Huff, kiiiiiiiii-</p><p>A goblin who could not even breathe properly ran away toward the grass.</p><p>Boom. Boom. Boom!</p><p>A group of monsters that looked like rats were all banging their heads on the ground while shaking.</p><p>Hilsman, who was watching the monsters with confusion, accepted what was going on once Cale pointed to someone in their party.</p><p>&ldquo;We have an adult Dragon with us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>It made sense.</p><p>Eruhaben looked toward Raon and started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Little kid, do you now know of my greatness?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...No!&rdquo;</p><p>Raon turned his head away and flew over to Cale.</p><p>An Adult Dragon has an overpowering aura even without using Dragon Fear. Monsters that relied on their instincts would show the swiftest reaction to that aura.</p><ul><li>Human, I will soon go through my first growth phase! So I am better!</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Whatever you say.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale ignored the whining voice in his head and started to speak to Hilsman, who was standing there with a blank expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep going.&rdquo;</p><p>Eruhaben asked Cale a question.</p><p>&ldquo;Cale Henituse, will you find the location of the ancient power once you get to the center of the Forest of Darkness?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes sir. I believe I will need to use one of my ancient powers to locate the Super Rock.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale thought that he would need to use the Fire of Destruction in order to find the house of the Guardian, the location of the Super Rock.</p><p>&ldquo;Human! You&rsquo;re going to use that thunderbolt again?! You&rsquo;re going to get hurt!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will only use a weak version.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare cough up blood again! I will destroy all of the rocks in the world if you do! DESTROY THEM ALL!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale casually played along with Raon.<br>Eruhaben had a look of disbelief while watching the two of them. However, he did not comment on it and instead asked a different question.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you say you found a Dragon corpse in the black swamp in here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes sir. You mentioned that you have never been to the Forest of Darkness?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes. I didn&rsquo;t want to look at any of these ugly monsters.&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;What a response.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to go to the swamp afterward?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No need. Too annoying. None of my business as to how another Dragon died.&rdquo;</p><p>Eruhaben showed an expression of annoyance. Raon flew up to his face and tilted his head in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Goldie, I&rsquo;m curious about your story! I&rsquo;m curious about you!&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Goldie.&rsquo;</p><p>The corner of Eruhaben&rsquo;s lips twitched before returning to normal.</p><p>&ldquo;Ahem. I&rsquo;ll tell you about it next time if you really want to know, little kid.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Alright! I&rsquo;ll be waiting!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ahem, ahem.&rdquo;</p><p>Eruhaben let out some fake coughs before stealthily changing the topic.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, this Forest of Darkness is slightly unique, so it is worth visiting at least once. That is why I am here now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Forest of Darkness is unique?&rdquo;</p><p>Eruhaben nodded his head.</p><p>&ldquo;The Five Forbidden Regions that the humans talk about were determined hundreds of years ago. Of those, the &rsquo;Forest of Darkness,&rsquo; the &rsquo;Path of No Return,&rsquo; and the &rsquo;Lake of Despair,&rsquo; have been around since ancient times.&rdquo; <span id="footnote-ref-71a9"><a href="#footnote-71a9">[1]</a></span><br>&ldquo;Since ancient times?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale had never heard this story before.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, these three have existed since ten thousand years ago. Ten thousand years is long, even for a Dragon.&rdquo;</p><p>Ancient times referred to anything more than ten thousand years old.</p><p>Cale felt like asking Eruhaben more questions about this curious story. However, something prevented him from doing so.</p><p>Grrrrr-</p><p>&ldquo;Y, young master-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>Clang.</p><p>Hilsman took out his sword and called out to Cale. Cale looked to the front.</p><p>They were currently at the boundary of the outer and inner regions of the Forest of Darkness. Hilsman was already across the boundary line.</p><p>Cale had come to this boundary before, but this was his first time stepping into the inner region.</p><p>&rsquo;Although I&rsquo;ve flown over it before.&rsquo;</p><p>This was his first time walking through this region.</p><p>The necromancer Mary&rsquo;s cave that was full of skeletons was in the outer region as well.</p><p>It was because she did not want to run into any strong monsters for no reason.</p><p>Cale stepped over the boundary line.</p><p>Grrrr-</p><p>He could see a large monster as soon as he entered. A monster that looked like a more violent version of an ogre showed itself from between the trees.<br>Its fangs were the size of Cale&rsquo;s arms and its black skin made it look uglier than an ogre. The club in its hand seemed to be made of rock.</p><p>However, this monster&rsquo;s eyes were focused.<br>It seemed to have some intelligence.</p><p>&ldquo;Young master-nim, please come behind me!&rdquo;</p><p>Hilsman pointed his sword at the monster as if he had never been scared of it.<br>Cale asked the brave Hilsman a question.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Excuse me?&rdquo;</p><p>Hilsman was confused at Cale&rsquo;s question. It was at that moment.</p><p>Boom.</p><p>The monster dropped the club in its hand and then...</p><p>Bang, bang!</p><p>It started to bang its head on the ground.</p><p>Hilsman finally took the time to look around. It was quiet, too quiet.<br>At that moment, he could hear someone&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you have some intelligence.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Eruhaben.</p><p>Hilsman flinched at Eruhaben&rsquo;s comment before seeing something that he had never seen before.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;<br>Grrr.<br>&ldquo;Lead us to the center.&rdquo;<br>Grr.</p><p>The monster quickly got up. Hilsman felt like he had seen the speed of a knight in the monster&rsquo;s movement.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The monster grabbed its club once again and slammed it toward a short tree next to it.</p><p>Crack, boom.</p><p>The tree fell over. Hilsman gasped at the strength of the monster, but the monster&rsquo;s next few actions were even more surprising.</p><p>The monster was guiding them while destroying any obstacle in their way.<br>Trees, small boulders, tall weeds, nothing survived the monster&rsquo;s desire to create a straight path for Eruhaben.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>Hilsman put his sword back in the scabbard at Eruhaben&rsquo;s words. He could feel the majestic nature of a Dragon.<br>However, Hilsman could not move.</p><p>&ldquo;...Young master-nim?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hey, why are you doing that?&rdquo;</p><p>Eruhaben was looking at Cale with confusion while Raon was starting to get anxious.</p><p>&ldquo;Human! Isn&rsquo;t that small thing in your hand the thunderbolt?!&rdquo;</p><p>A small fire was floating on top of Cale&rsquo;s palm.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you using it without saying anything?! You cannot faint!&rdquo;</p><p>However, Cale could not hear Raon&rsquo;s comments.</p><p>Boom. Boom.</p><p>His heart had been beating wildly ever since they entered the inner region.</p><p>Cale lowered his head to look at the ground.</p><p>Something, an unknown aura, was rising up from the ground. That aura made the fire in his hand appear.</p><p>Boom. Boom.</p><p>It also made the Vitality of the Heart run wild.</p><p>&ldquo;...Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale sounded confused.</p><p>Swiiiiiiiish-</p><p>Wind started to gather down at his feet. The Sound of the Wind was creating a small whirlwind by his feet.</p><p>And finally.</p><p>Paaat.</p><p>A small shield appeared on his left hand.<br>It was the Indestructible Shield.</p><p>&rsquo;...This is weird. This is very weird.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale recalled something he had read in the ancient book.</p><p>&lt; Right before going to save the world from darkness, he left all of his belongings, as well as the belongings of his friends, in his hometown. &gt;</p><p>The other three got closer to Cale. Eruhaben was looking at Cale like he was looking at an interesting creature, while Raon shouted with anxiety.</p><p>&ldquo;Human, what is going on? What&rsquo;s wrong? Did your ancient powers break?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale slowly started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;...I&rsquo;m getting a feel for where it is.&rdquo;</p><p>It was an Eureka moment!</p><p>Cale quickly started to walk. He looked toward Eruhaben and started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will take the lead.&rdquo;</p><p>Eruhaben, who had been observing Cale with an interested expression, started to walk in front of Cale. Eruhaben had already told the monster to get lost.</p><p>&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale nodded his head at Eruhaben&rsquo;s command and headed toward the center of the Forest of Darkness.</p><p>Eruhaben was moving quickly while Cale was using the Sound of the Wind to keep up.<br>Raon used haste magic on Hilsman so that Hilsman could keep up with them.</p><p>Cale was telling Eruhaben where to go.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn to the left.&rdquo;</p><p>Boom. Boom.</p><p>The ancient powers in his body, as well as the ground under his feet, were telling him where to go. It was impossible to explain this with words.</p><p>&ldquo;To the Northwest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now to the Northeast.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale finally stopped after a while.</p><p>They were near the Northern boundary of the inner region.</p><p>Cale could see a boulder at this location.</p><p>It was just a large boulder that was about three times as tall as Cale.<br>It looked just like your average boulder that could be found anywhere in the Henituse territory.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it here?&rdquo;</p><p>Eruhaben looked toward Cale and asked. However, he did not need to hear Cale&rsquo;s answer.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it is.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale was smiling.</p><p>&rsquo;They&rsquo;re running wild.&rsquo;</p><p>The four ancient powers inside Cale&rsquo;s body were running wild.</p><p>&rsquo;...Seriously?&rsquo;</p><p>Were the Super Rock&rsquo;s friends really the owners of the ancient powers he had gained until now?</p><p>Cale slowly started to smile again.<br>It was at that moment.</p><p>Crackle-</p><p>The fire that was floating on top of Cale&rsquo;s right palm started to fly toward the boulder.</p><p>The boulder and the fire made contact with each other.</p><p>Ruuuuumble.</p><p>The boulder started to shake as soon as the two made contact.<br>Cale could feel the rumbling underneath his feet.</p><p>The boulder started to crack on its own.</p><p>At that moment, a foreign voice started to speak in Cale&rsquo;s mind. It was a profound voice that seemed to belong to a righteous person.</p><p>&rsquo;I came to the right spot.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale was feeling extremely giddy.</p><ul><li>My friend of fire, you have finally arrived. My eternal enemy and friend, I- mm?</li></ul><p>The profound voice became nervous.</p><ul><li>Huh?</li></ul><p>The voice seemed extremely confused as well.</p><ul><li>...What is going on?</li></ul><p>The profound voice, the owner of the &rsquo;Scary Giant Cobblestone,&rsquo; started to speak in a nervous voice.</p><ul><li>Why is the cheapskate with the thief, the crybaby, and even the glutton-</li></ul><p>The cheapskate was the Fire of Destruction.<br>The thief was the Sound of the Wind.<br>The crybaby was the Vitality of the Heart.<br>The glutton must be the Indestructible Shield.</p><ul><li>Who are you?</li></ul><p>Cale started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Cale Henituse.&rdquo;</p><p>Eureka! <span id="footnote-ref-dbfb"><a href="#footnote-dbfb">[2]</a></span></p><hr><div id="footnote-71a9"><p>1.
