<p>It was a funny story.</p><p>It was back when Kim Rok Soo was looking up information on the unranked monsters and their appearances and recording everything that he found.</p><p>There was something eye-catching regarding this destruction of the original central shelters and the monster attacks prior to the appearance of the first unranked monster.</p><p>&rsquo;It was the appearance of the taster monsters.&rsquo;</p><p>From Grade 3 to Grade 2...</p><p>And again from Grade 2 to Grade 1...</p><p>The taster monsters appeared at each switch between grades.</p><p>Cale couldn't forget the word, &rsquo;taster.&rsquo;</p><p>It remained on his mind even without using his record ability.</p><p>The first taster monsters.</p><p>The Grade 1 taster monsters that appeared during the shift from Grade 3 to Grade 2 monsters were what had destroyed Kim Rok Soo's first central shelter.</p><p>Many people had died.</p><p>&rsquo;It was difficult to fight against even one Grade 1 monster during this time.&rsquo;</p><p>People didn't know how to use their abilities properly yet.</p><p>They didn't have enough information.</p><p>Kim Rok Soo had seen the people die by these taster monsters as he ran away.</p><p>That was why he didn't like them being called tasters.</p><p>But the scary part was...</p><p>&rsquo;They really were tasters.&rsquo;</p><p>The upcoming Grade 1 monsters&rsquo; attack and the invasion of the unranked monster in the near future.</p><p>These were definitely tasters in comparison to those two incidents.</p><p>They needed to overcome it.</p><p>They needed to do it without taking much damage.</p><p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;The overall situation is that the monsters will attack by their grade, but as I mentioned before, there are some special moments in between.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hey, Rok Soo.&rdquo;</p><p>Jang Man Soo and Choi Han who was carrying him on his back walked over to Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;You worked hard, mister.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, I should be okay again after resting an hour or two.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I understand. Please get some rest.&rdquo;</p><p>The shield would be usable again in two hours.</p><p>Jang Man Soo hesitated for a moment before starting to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;...Will we be able to defeat the Grade 1 monsters? Especially when there will be 7 of them?&rdquo;</p><p>Everybody around Cale suddenly became quiet.</p><p>Seven Grade 1 monsters.</p><p>That number made everybody feel as if they would suffocate.</p><p>A fierce battle was continuing on the roof as that was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep dropping things!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Keep it up!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Use a little more of your psychokinesis!&rdquo;</p><p>The people on the roof ledge were throwing everything they had, including weak attacks, toward the Grade 3 monsters trying to climb over the wall of fallen monsters and debris.</p><p>That was why they could not tell these people.</p><p>They couldn&rsquo;t know that seven Grade 1 monsters would soon appear.</p><p>They would lose their will to fight.</p><p>Even Jang Man Soo was this scared.</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p><p>Someone other than Cale had responded.</p><p>It was Park Jin Tae.</p><p>He was looking at Choi Han who was carrying Jang Man Soo with a piercing gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;We can manage to deal with seven of them.&rdquo;</p><p>Smile.</p><p>Park Jin Tae smiled toward Choi Han who was looking at him.</p><p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han will not be participating this time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae and the others all opened their eyes in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;How can we do it without this bastard-&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Night.&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae shut up after hearing Cale say one word.</p><p>&ldquo;You remember what I said, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Night.</p><p>&ldquo;The moment the sun goes down... The moment the sunset completely disappears...&rdquo;</p><p>The moment that darkness falls over the world...</p><p>&ldquo;The monsters will go crazy. They will become much more violent than before and their attack strength will multiply by 1.5 times.&rdquo;</p><p>That was why night was the first crucial moment.</p><p>&ldquo;The Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters will attack together.&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Rok Soo who had run away with the crumbling central shelter behind him remembered that night clearly.</p><p>He had crawled into a gap between some building debris and watched while keeping quiet.</p><p>He had seen how the night was turned into hell by those crazed monsters.</p><p>Numerous humans had died.</p><p>That night was brutal for the humans who could not gather together and had to split up because the central shelter crumbled down.</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han needs to stay out of this battle for us to be able to survive the night.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale and Choi Han would not be able to get any sleep during the night.</p><p>&ldquo;This punk needs to get some rest right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Then-&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae bit down on his lips. He barely managed to ask.</p><p>&ldquo;Then how will we fight them?&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae was certain.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm sure you already have the answer.&rdquo;</p><p>He should know how to kill seven Grade 1 monsters.</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Leader-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Lee Chul Min's voice.</p><p>Everybody looked toward Lee Chul Min who was standing on the ledge and pointing somewhere.</p><p>&ldquo;The Grade 2 monsters are starting to get closer!&rdquo;</p><p>The Grade 3 monsters around the building were doing everything they could to get inside the building and kill the humans.</p><p>But the Grade 3 monsters in the distance that had not gotten close yet were slowly moving away.</p><p>It was as if there was a baton pass.</p><p>&ldquo;...They&rsquo;re making way for the Grade 2 monsters.&rdquo;</p><p>As Park Jin Tae mentioned, the Grade 3 monsters were moving back as the Grade 2 monsters got closer.</p><p>More Grade 2 monsters were starting to appear.</p><p>A completely different type of pressure than the Grade 3 monsters was starting to overwhelm the people.</p><p>Tick tock.</p><p>Cale looked at the watch.</p><p>It was past 2 pm already.</p><p>It would be 3 pm soon enough.</p><p>The taster Grade 1 monsters would appear at 3 pm.</p><p>&ldquo;A, and-&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Chul Min&rsquo;s voice was shaking.</p><p>From within the Grade 3 and Grade 2 monsters that were similar in height...</p><p>There were oddly tall monsters appearing here and there.</p><p>&ldquo;T, they appeared!&rdquo;</p><p>The others shouted along with Lee Chul Min.</p><p>&ldquo;Gasp! G, Grade 1......!&rdquo;</p><p>The people on the southern ledge slowly started to move back.</p><p>They recognized the Grade 1 monsters.</p><p>Park Jin Tae started to mumble.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm relieved. At least the Grade 1 monsters are all coming from one direction.&rdquo;</p><p>The seven monsters would appear from the south.</p><p>Only three were visible right now.</p><p>A monster with a snake head, a monster that seemed to be a mix of a lion and a tiger, and a skeleton-like monster.</p><p>They were all very different monsters.</p><p>Park Jin Tae observed the monsters as he started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Kim Rok Soo, you said that seven of those bastards would come attacking from the south at 3 pm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p><p>His voice was extremely calm.</p><p>Park Jin Tae became annoyed at his calmness and looked toward Kim Rok Soo.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>He then flinched.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you-&rdquo;</p><p>It was because Kim Rok Soo was looking somewhere else and smiling.</p><p>The others who looked toward Cale as Park Jin Tae did flinched.</p><p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you I had foresight, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Foresight.</p><p>Everybody shut up after hearing that word.</p><p>They had to feel the greatness of Kim Rok Soo's foresight ability. They recalled how Kim Rok Soo had been right about everything until now.</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han will not fight.&rdquo;</p><p>There wasn't even the slightest of openings in his stern voice.</p><p>&rsquo;Do we need to take care of it on our own?&rsquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae started to frown.</p><p>He knew Kim Rok Soo must have a way for them to defeat them on their own, but he was worried.</p><p>He heard Kim Rok Soo's parched voice at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;But there are others who will fight with us.&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;What?&rsquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae's eyes opened wide.</p><p>However, Cale was still looking to the north as he put a hand on Lee Jin Joo's shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Noona.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hmm, hmm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Repeat what I say loud enough so that it can reach that building.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale was pointing to a building to the north.</p><p>It was a pretty tall building that was barely standing up as half of it was broken.</p><p>&rsquo;Hmm?&rsquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae could see human-like figures where Cale was pointing.</p><p>&rsquo;Two people?&rsquo;</p><p>He could see two people.</p><p>&rsquo;This bastard, perhaps?&rsquo;</p><p>Were these the people who would fight with them?</p><p>Park Jin Tae got chills and looked toward Cale, but Cale was just telling Lee Jin Joo what to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop peeking glances while running away. Come here if you want to survive.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale recalled a conversation in his mind even as he told Jin Joo what to say.</p><p>&rsquo;Team leader-nim, team leader-nim! Are you not going to wake up?&rsquo;</p><p>When he had to face his despair while under Elisneh the First's illusion in the Molden Kingdom...</p><p>Of the two people who had appeared in his illusion...</p><p>One of them was Jung So Hoon.</p><p>&rsquo;...Should I make a cup ramen?&rsquo;</p><p>The rookie Jung So Hoon had asked if he had wanted some ramen.</p><p>And the other person...</p><p>&rsquo;Team leader-nim! Is this the time to be eating ramen? Are you eating one too because that punk is eating one?&rsquo;</p><p>Assistant Leader Kim Min Ah.</p><p>She was one of the vanguard members for Cale&rsquo;s attack team.</p><p>She was married and had a cute daughter named Bae Eun Soo.</p><p>Cale recalled a conversation he had with Kim Min Ah while he was Team leader Kim Rok Soo.</p><p>&rsquo;...You were there?&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;Yes, sir. I was running away, saw that place, and ran away again. I'm more shocked that you were from there. You managed to survive even without any abilities at that time.&rsquo;</p><p>She had mentioned that she had visited the central shelter where Cale had been.</p><p>In fact, she was there on the day the central shelter crumbled.</p><p>&rsquo;Around what time?&rsquo;<br>&rsquo;Probably around 2 pm or 3 pm on the first day? The taster Grade 1 monsters appeared not too long after I got there.&rsquo;</p><p>The corners of Cale&rsquo;s lips started to go up.</p><p>She had said the following.</p><p>&rsquo;I was with the punk who would become my husband at that time. I dragged him around. Ahahahaha!&rsquo;</p><p>Cale called out toward the two people who were in that building up north and looking toward them.</p><p>&ldquo;Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum. Come join us here.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale looked toward Lee Jin Joo.</p><p>&ldquo;Noona, are you not going to say it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Jin Joo blinked in shock before starting to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn't I tell you I have the power of foresight? The two of them are strong.&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae quietly mumbled at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;That crazy foresight ability.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale completely ignored him and looked at Lee Jin Joo.</p><p>Lee Jin Joo snapped out of it and started to speak.</p><p>{Stop peeking glances while running away. Come here if you want to survive.}</p><p>The two people's bodies shifted significantly at that moment.</p><p>They seemed to be shocked.</p><p>Lee Jin Joo watched their reaction as she continued to speak.</p><p>{Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum. Come join us here.}</p><p>Cale started to speak again.</p><p>&ldquo;Bae Puh Rum. Fly over.&rdquo;</p><p>{Bae Puh Rum. Fly over.}</p><p>Park Jin Tae walked over to Cale after Lee Jin Joo said that.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! He&rsquo;s an ability user who can fly?&rdquo;</p><p>This was his first time hearing about such an ability.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Look over there.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale motioned to the northern building with his chin.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s flying over.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Ho.&rdquo;</p><p>A man was flying with a woman on his back as Cale had mentioned.</p><p>He could see the woman pointing to this side and shouting something.</p><p>&rsquo;This crazy Kim Rok Soo!&rsquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae couldn&rsquo;t help but be astonished while looking at him.</p><p>He was thinking that Kim Rok Soo was scary.</p><p>The ability to fly?</p><p>The ability to tell the strength of their opponent?</p><p>Kim Rok Soo had an ability that was much scarier than either of those kinds of abilities.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p><p>The woman who was on the man&rsquo;s back pointed to where Cale was standing.</p><p>She then started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Who the hell are you guys?! How do you know who we are?&rdquo;</p><p>Wave wave.</p><p>Cale motioned to them as if telling them to hurry up and get here.</p><p>Bae Puh Rum and Kim Min Ah chatted with each other for a bit before getting closer to the roof.</p><p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Kim Min Ah.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who are you and how do you know my name-&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll heal your brother&rsquo;s injuries.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</p><p>Both Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum looked toward Cale in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Your older brother is in that building over there. He&rsquo;s in a terrible state right now because of the large injury on his side.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale recalled how Kim Min Ah had looked sad in the past.</p><p>&rsquo;I fought with my brother there. He told me to leave him behind and fly away with Bae Puh Rum.&rsquo;</p><p>Kim Min Ah had tried her best to smile.</p><p>&rsquo;But I stayed with him until the end. I was relieved I got to spend my brother&rsquo;s last moments with him.&rsquo;</p><p>She had then added on in a joking tone.</p><p>&rsquo;Of course, Bae Puh Rum had to work his ass off to carry me and run away after that.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale put a hand on Grandma Kim's shoulder.</p><p>"We will heal your brother&rsquo;s external injury. In return, I hope that the two of you can fight with us at this shelter.&rdquo;</p><p>Grandma Kim placed her wrinkled hand on Cale&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Cale felt the warmth of her hand as he continued to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Then the two of you, and Kim Min Ah, your brother as well... All of you will survive.&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum were high school students at this time.</p><p>The two of them were silent.</p><p>Bae Puh Rum started to speak at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Min Ah. Should I go bring big bro over?&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Min Ah started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me down first.&rdquo;</p><p>Bae Puh Rum and Kim Min Ah landed on the roof.</p><p>Lee Chul Min shouted at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Seven of them! All seven of them have appeared!&rdquo;</p><p>The people who were standing on the ledge lowered their hands and looked toward Cale.</p><p>It was okay for them to do that.</p><p>&ldquo;...The monsters are retreating.&rdquo;</p><p>The Grade 3 monsters were retreating.</p><p>They moved farther back than where the Grade 2 monsters were standing. They looked like actors moving off stage after the first act was completed.</p><p>Boom.</p><p>A Grade 1 monster with a Bear&rsquo;s body and purple tiger stripes stomped and shook the ground.</p><p>Just one monster moving forward felt as if tens of Grade 3 monsters were moving toward them.</p><p>This was the impact of a Grade 1 monster coming close.</p><p>&ldquo;Kim Min Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Your brother has the message ability right?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale walked past Kim Min Ah as her eyes opened wide.</p><p>He then stood at the door heading down from the roof and pointed to some people.</p><p>&ldquo;Park Jin Tae, Kim Min Ah, Lee Chul Min, Bae Puh Rum. The four of you will fight with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae asked in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Y, you're fighting too?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at Kim Rok Soo&rsquo;s feeble body.</p><p>Cale confidently responded while looking at this gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I am fighting as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale pointed to himself with his finger.</p><p>&ldquo;Park Jin Tae, Kim Min Ah, Lee Chul Min, and Bae Puh Rum will each take care of one monster.&rdquo;</p><p>That was a total of four monsters.</p><p>&ldquo;And I'll take care of three of them.&rdquo;</p><p>The corners of Cale&rsquo;s lips started to go up.</p> <a href="./chapter563.html" class="chapter-nav">
