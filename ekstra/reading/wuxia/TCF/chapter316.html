I don't care whether you take it all or share it with others. Do whatever you want.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary looked back and forth between Cale and the tree trunks. The glutton was talking in Cale's mind as he watched Mary.</p><ul><li>It needs to be purified. There&rsquo;s a limit to how long the trees can hold it in.</li></ul><p>The Man-Eating Tree in the Henituse territory.<br>People had avoided the desolate area around the tree, however, that area had not become a dead area from dead mana.</p><p>Everything would just dry up over there.</p><ul><li>Dead things that do not return to nature and instead remain in the world start to cause issues for other lifeforms.</li></ul><p>Just like the Man-Eating Tree.<br>It could have a negative effect on the surrounding area.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm? Everybody is out here?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale raised his head after suddenly hearing a voice.</p><p>He looked above a black tree trunk that had grown tall. The Dark Elf Tasha was looking down from the top of the tree.</p><p>The Dark Elves were currently assisting the warriors in restoring the Jungle after the battle. It was because the Elementals with different elements were quite helpful for the restoration projects.</p><p>&ldquo;I, mm, rushed here, so I am happy to see you right away.&rdquo;</p><p>Tasha had an awkward expression on her face as she jumped off the tree trunk.</p><p>Cale looked toward Tasha instead of the quiet Mary.<br>No, to be more specific, he was looking at the man behind Tasha who had an extremely shocked expression on his face.</p><p>&rsquo;Why is he here?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale had a questioning gaze on his face while Tasha could only smile apologetically toward him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, once I reported the situation-&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh! My goodness! Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo;</p><p>The man behind Tasha cut her off and continued to exclaim in admiration.</p><p>&rsquo;Aigoo.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale was starting to get a headache. However, his body quickly started to move. He had no other choice.</p><p>&ldquo;This worthless fool does not dare to see such a revered being's face while standing on my two legs!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mayor-nim!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandfather! Please!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale and Tasha quickly grabbed Obante, the mayor of the Dark Elves&rsquo; Underground City, as he tried to kneel. <span id="footnote-ref-d1f4"><a href="#footnote-d1f4">[1]</a></span><br>Tasha&rsquo;s grandfather was still the same.</p><ul><li>This Dark Elf is acting like this again!</li></ul><p>Cale did not have the time to listen to Raon's excited voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandfather, please!&rdquo;</p><p>Tasha tried to stop him, but the Dark Elf mayor was completely astonished after seeing the person standing right outside Cale's tent.</p><p>It was a man with white gold hair.<br>It was Eruhaben.<br>The last person to come out of Cale's tent had a video communication device connected with crown prince Alberu in his hand.<br>He was the only one who remembered about Alberu when everybody else had forgotten about him and rushed out, as well as the person who had been quietly observing everything from a corner of the tent.</p><p>The current mayor of the Dark Elves who had lived for over 500 years could not think about anything after feeling a cold presence.</p><p>&rsquo;This level of presence......!&rsquo;</p><p>The other Dark Elves who had never met a Dragon before and thus could not accurately pick up on Eruhaben and the invisible Raon&rsquo;s presence.<br>However, mayor Obante who had seen a Dragon in the past was immediately able to know Eruhaben's true identity.</p><p>He also got chills after realizing that he could not feel Raon's presence.</p><p>&rsquo;...Raon-nim has gotten much stronger!&rsquo;</p><p>Obante could tell that Raon had gotten much stronger than him because, unlike last time, he was unable to feel Raon's presence while he was invisible.</p><p>&ldquo;Mayor-nim.&rdquo;</p><p>Obante turned his head after hearing a low voice calling for him.<br>He could see Cale Henituse looking at him.</p><p>&rsquo;...He's gotten stronger.&rsquo;</p><p>He could feel the presence of nature flowing out of Cale. His Elemental was circling around Cale without knowing what to do.</p><p>&rsquo;...Has it been one year now?&rsquo;</p><p>It had been about a year since they had first met.<br>Just what could have happened to Cale's group during this time?</p><p>&rsquo;The war made them this much stronger?&rsquo;</p><p>That was nonsense. He believed that there was a different reason that they got this much stronger.<br>Although that reason was important, it wasn&rsquo;t very important to mayor Obante.</p><p>His gaze then brushed past Mary.<br>She was like a granddaughter to him.<br>At the same time, he thought about the Land of Death, as well as the Underground City underneath where he was mayor.</p><p>He thought about the Circle of Fate that had been passed down for generations.<br>That fate was finally starting to appear during this generation.</p><p>He peeked toward the Dragon with white-gold hair.<br>The two of them made eye contact.</p><ul><li>Ignore me.</li></ul><p>He could hear the Dragon's voice.<br>Obante put strength into both of his legs and stood up straight.</p><p>Cale flinched after seeing the way Obante was looking at him.<br>Forget passionate, it looked a bit... crazed.</p><p>&rsquo;What&rsquo;s up with this old man?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale felt chills on his back after seeing this Dragon maniac looking at him with such a fierce gaze.</p><p>Pat.</p><p>Obante put a hand on Cale's shoulder and whispered in his ear.</p><p>&ldquo;I will put everything on the line as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;What is he talking about?<br>What nonsense is he spewing after just showing up here?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale looked away from the fiery gaze of the mayor and looked toward Tasha.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, seriously! Mayor-nim, how can you put it like that?!&rdquo;</p><p>Tasha looked toward Cale with an annoyed expression and started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I informed the mayor-nim about the Dark Elves&rsquo; battles last night. The mayor-nim then said that he had something to say regarding Mary and rushed over. He also said that he had something to give to you, young master Cale.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Mary?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale&rsquo;s gaze turned back toward the mayor.<br>The mayor started to speak at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Mary.&rdquo;</p><p>He gently called Mary&rsquo;s name.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, grandfather.&rdquo;</p><p>Obante looked toward Mary who was responding calmly as usual and recalled when she was ten years old.</p><p>&rsquo;I prefer the hurting necromancer.&rsquo;</p><p>She had chosen to become a necromancer when given the option of becoming a black mage or a necromancer.</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of necromancer do you want to be?&rdquo;</p><p>Obante asked a question he had not asked back then. Mary closed her mouth after hearing that question.<br>Obante&rsquo;s gaze was too serious for her to give an answer without thinking about it.<br>Although he might be goofy, this was the wisest Dark Elf in the world. He was also the nice grandfather who had opened up the path for her to become a necromancer.</p><p>Mary looked toward Cale.<br>She could hear Raon's voice.</p><ul><li>Good little Mary! Answer however you want! I will even give you permission to use the words, &rsquo;great and mighty,&rsquo; in order to describe yourself!</li></ul><p>Mary started to smile underneath the black robe.</p><p>She had made up her mind about something during the last battle when she fought against the Tower Master who was controlling Honte.<br>It was similar to the author of the book she had studied from.</p><p>&lt; You just have to be almost unrivaled in strength. &gt;<br>&lt; Like me. The Sage of Death. &gt;</p><p>Mary shared her thoughts with Obante.</p><p>&ldquo;Unrivaled.&rdquo;</p><p>She was hungry.<br>She became hungry after seeing the trees that were filled with dead mana.</p><p>Hungry was the only way Mary knew to describe this feeling.<br>It was because she had never felt this type of greed or desire before. It was different than when all she wanted to do was to see the outside world.<br>It was a greed that dug as deep as a swamp.</p><p>She wanted to get stronger.<br>That was her greed and desire.<br>She was hungry because she had not reached the level that she wanted to be at.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to become strong enough to be unrivaled.&rdquo;</p><p>Mayor Obante continued to gently ask.</p><p>&ldquo;Like who?&rdquo;</p><p>Mary did not hesitate to answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Like the Sage of Death.&rdquo;</p><p>That was the author who had taught her about the path to becoming a necromancer.</p><p>&lt; I hope you become even stronger than me. My disciple who will be reading this book. &gt;</p><p>She wanted to be like her.</p><p>Tasha flinched after hearing Mary&rsquo;s response.<br>There was something her grandfather Obante had told her before she came to the Jungle while telling her to protect Mary.</p><p>&rsquo;Yes, this may all just be nature taking its course. It is finally time for someone to receive the will of the Sage of Death.&rsquo;</p><p>She had questioned who the Sage of Death was at that time. Tasha&rsquo;s gaze automatically turned toward Obante.<br>However, Obante was looking at Cale instead. He opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;The Sage of Death.&rdquo;</p><p>Obante took a book out of his clothes.<br>It was a story that had been passed down to the mayor of the Underground City for generations after generations.<br>The Sage of Death.</p><p>&ldquo;She is death itself.&rdquo;</p><p>She had embraced death.<br>Furthermore.</p><p>&ldquo;She was the only Queen of the dark beings.&rdquo;</p><p>Both light and darkness were part of nature.<br>She had been the one to gather together the beings who could only live in darkness.</p><p>&ldquo;The Queen of Death.&rdquo; <span id="footnote-ref-6413"><a href="#footnote-6413">[2]</a></span></p><p>Cale recalled what the Tower Master had said during the battle once the Dark Elf mayor said that title.</p><p>&rsquo;The Queen of Death will be so sad. She would have been happy that another necromancer had appeared.&rsquo;</p><p>The Sage of Death was the Queen of Death.<br>However, Obante was not finished speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;She was the one who turned the Caro Kingdom's desert into the Land of Death of the Five Forbidden Regions.&rdquo;</p><p>The Land of Death was the only one of the Five Forbidden Regions where a person was the main focal point of the legend.<br>It was a desert that had red sand during the day and black sand at night.<br>She had created that desert.</p><p>&ldquo;She was the final necromancer.&rdquo;</p><p>The sage, queen, and the final being.</p><p>&ldquo;She was called the, &rsquo;Queen of Death,&rsquo; as she was the only necromancer to overpower black mages.&rdquo;</p><p>She was someone who had reached the zenith of darkness with overwhelming and unrivaled power.</p><p>&ldquo;She was also the person who created a place for the Dark Elves to live.&rdquo;</p><p>A place for the Dark Elves to live.<br>She had created that large underground city that was called the City of Death or the City of Life.</p><p>Cale recalled something else that the Tower Master had said.</p><p>&rsquo;I barely managed to get rid of all of them. The Dark Elves as well. I thought I had dried out their seeds.&rsquo;</p><p>The Alchemists&rsquo; Bell Tower&rsquo;s Tower Master had thought that the Dark Elves were gone as well.<br>However, they were living underneath the Land of Death.<br>Obante started to smile.</p><p>&ldquo;It's a long story to explain, but the black mages tried to kill the Dark Elves as well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Grandfather! Is that true?&rdquo;</p><p>Tasha asked in shock while Obante just shook his head while saying that it was ancient history.</p><p>&ldquo;The Dark Elves were responsible for making the Underground City beautiful, however, the Sage of Death was the one to originally provide that place for us.&rdquo;</p><p>Obante closed his eyes as if he was thinking about the story that was only passed on from mayor to mayor.</p><p>The Dark Elves did not hate the humans who despised them generation after generation.<br>Why?</p><p>It was because each Dark Elf in charge of the Underground City had said something to them since a long time ago.</p><p>&rsquo;Humans are similar to us.<br>Do not hate all of them.<br>There are humans who are suffering like us.&rsquo;</p><p>They could not hate all humans as it was a, &rsquo;human,&rsquo; who had provided the Dark Elves a place to live.</p><p>Obante looked toward Cale and continued to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I will put our full force forward in order to help all of you, and-&rdquo;</p><p>The old man's wrinkled hand went up to Mary&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;We will help Mary.&rdquo;</p><p>The Sage of Death was said to have said something before her death.</p><p>&lt; The next King of Death can only be a necromancer. &gt; <span id="footnote-ref-e246"><a href="#footnote-e246">[3]</a></span></p><p>The Dark Elf Obante could not disagree with that.<br>Why?</p><p>It was because both Dark Elves, black mages, and other beings of darkness did not know the pain that darkness could bring.<br>They were especially clueless about death.</p><p>However, necromancers always kept pain and death by their side.</p><p>&lt; The position of king is something that only someone who has experienced rock bottom and the lowest point can achieve. &gt;</p><p>Obante thought about the word, &rsquo;fate.&rsquo;</p><p>10 years old.<br>A child had escaped from a human city and ran across the desert in order to survive. That child had ended up a necromancer with a disgusting appearance.<br>And then, black magic reappeared in the world once that child came back out to the world seventeen years late.</p><p>Many things that Obante had never even imagined would happen were happening.</p><p>The position of, &rsquo;Mayor of the City of Death.&rsquo;<br>The Dark Elves never had a king even though the Whale tribe, who were fewer in number, had a king.<br>The majority of Dark Elves did not know the reason behind this as it had been too long, however, the mayor knew the reason.</p><p>The position of king was already taken.</p><p>Obante patted the blankly staring Mary&rsquo;s shoulder before handing the book in his hand to Cale.</p><p>"This is the book the Sage of Death had left behind about black magic.&rdquo;</p><p>He had offered this book to Mary along with the necromancer book.</p><p>&ldquo;The Sage said that there would be different owners for this book and the necromancer book.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale received the book that was covered in black.<br>There was no title on the black book.</p><p>&ldquo;The Sage said that the rightful owner of this book would know it belonged to them once they read the first page.&rdquo;</p><p>Obante was telling Cale to read this book similar to how Mary had chosen the necromancer book after reading through it.<br>Cale opened the black book with an odd expression on his face.</p><p>Flip.<br>He could see what was written on the first page.</p><p>&rsquo;Oh, would you look at this?&rsquo;</p><p>Cale started to smile.<br>There was a phrase written on the black book.</p><p>&lt; Find the mirror. &gt;</p><p>The mirror.<br>He thought about the Condemnation of the Sun. It was a divine item.</p><p>Cale suddenly got the chills.</p><p>He started to wonder just how much story was not in the first five volumes of, &rsquo;The Birth of a Hero.&rsquo;<br>How were things all connected?<br>Maybe everything had changed as a result of cause and effect now that this was the, &rsquo;real world.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale had an image appear in his mind after he read the next phrase.</p><p>&lt; Pull out the sword. &gt;</p><p>It would start at the center of the Empire. The image in his mind would start from the bottom of the Alchemists&rsquo; Bell Tower.</p><p>&lt; And hand it to your warrior. &gt;</p><p>Cale's gaze turned toward Saint Jack.</p><p>&lt; Warrior, move forward without hesitation. &gt;</p><p>He then turned toward Mary.</p><p>&lt; The Queen of Death will create a path for you. &gt;</p><p>The Sun God twins and the Queen of Death.<br>Cale got chills while thinking about the image that they would create in the Empire.<br>It was the good kind of chills this time.</p><p>He could see the fall of the Alchemists&rsquo; Bell Tower, the tallest tower on the Western continent.</p><hr><div id="footnote-d1f4"><p>1.
