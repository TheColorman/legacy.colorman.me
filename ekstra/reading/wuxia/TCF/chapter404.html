So, the White Star thinks that the earth attribute ancient power is either in our next door neighborhood, the Whale tribe's neighborhood or Mary&rsquo;s neighborhood?</li></ul><p>Cale quietly nodded his head at Raon's question.</p><p>Only two people were said to possess the earth attribute ancient power during ancient times.</p><p>One was the Scary Giant Cobblestone while the other was the ancient White Star.</p><p>The current White Star was looking for the ancient White Star's earth attribute ancient power.</p><p>The three potential locations of this power were the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s Northwest region, the land of the Whale tribe and the Caro Kingdom&rsquo;s southern region.</p><p>Boom boom.<br>Cale could feel his heart beating wildly.</p><p>&rsquo;This is driving me nuts.&rsquo;</p><p>The location of the earth attribute ancient power Cale and Choi Han had deducted using Choi Jung Gun&rsquo;s memoirs was the Roan Kingdom.<br>That meant that the answer was...</p><p>&rsquo;The Roan Kingdom's Northwest region.&rsquo;</p><p>The home of Marquis Taylor Stan.</p><p>&rsquo;...It makes sense.&rsquo;</p><p>This hypothesis made a lot of sense.</p><p>The Roan Kingdom's Northeast region that Cale's Henituse territory represented was famous for its marbles.<br>In comparison, the Roan Kingdom's Northwest region, Marquis Stan&rsquo;s territory was famous for its granite.</p><p>Marble and granite.<br>The Roan Kingdom was famous for being the land of boulders because these two different types of rocks that existed in large quantities.</p><p>&rsquo;Things are turning out quite interesting.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale could not help but smile.<br>It was at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Becrock Tower Master-nim, do you think that the liege will visit all three locations?&rdquo;</p><p>The Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower&rsquo;s Tower Master was calling the mage, &rsquo;Becrock Tower Master-nim.&rsquo;<br>Cale now knew that the mage&rsquo;s name was Becrock.</p><ul><li>Human! That alchemist is spewing nonsense! The smart Rosalyn will be the Tower Master! Even gramps said that Rosalyn was a genius!</li></ul><p>He ignored Raon&rsquo;s side comments.</p><p>&rsquo;...Despair, destruction, chaos.&rsquo;</p><p>He ignored the Wind Elemental as well.<br>Cale then got closer to the window.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. The liege said he would first visit the spot that is most likely to hold the power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then I guess the North had the highest possibility. How did such information-&rdquo;</p><p>The Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower&rsquo;s Tower Master looked toward mage Becrock with curiosity and greed as he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wish to know, Tower Master-nim?&rdquo;</p><p>However, he changed his expression after seeing the cold gaze in Becrock&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not. I just wish to follow the will of our liege.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Good. That is all we need to do.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale could see the sweating Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower's Tower Master and mage Becrock as he got closer. He could also see inside the ninth floor.<br>There were many different types of documents and he could see a map of the entire Mogoru Empire on the wall.</p><p>There were many red dots on the map.</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s their travel route.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale could instantly tell that the red dots and the connecting lines were the routes the four Alchemists&rsquo; Towers would use to attack the capital.</p><ul><li>Human, are we going to steal that?</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Steal?<br>For what?</p><p>It&rsquo;ll be obvious if we stole it.&rsquo;<br>With Becrock here, it was better not to mess up the ninth floor.</p><p>That was why Cale pulled on the black cloth covering his neck.</p><p>&rsquo;We just need to record it.&rsquo;</p><p>His eyes started to record the entire map and every single detail on it.</p><ul><li>Human, don't we need to steal those documents?</li></ul><p>As Raon mentioned, Cale could not only look at the map. He needed to go in and look through those documents as well.<br>The size, makeup, and location of the enemy troops were important as well.<br>It was at that moment.</p><p>Knock knock knock.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>The Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower's Tower Master raised his voice after hearing the knocks. Becrock looked toward the door as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Tower Master-nim, I think you need to meet a merchant.&rdquo;</p><p>The Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower's Tower Master started to frown after hearing the response.<br>The one who made the report was one of his trusted subordinates who would not interrupt his conversation with mage Becrock for no reason.</p><p>&ldquo;...A merchant?&rdquo;</p><p>But he interrupted them for a damn merchant?<br>The Tower Master continued to speak as he found this to be odd.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p><p>Click.<br>The door opened and trusted subordinate bowed as he continued to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I apologize for interrupting your conversation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It's fine. What do you mean you think I should meet with a merchant?&rdquo;</p><p>The Tower Master could see a small smile appear before quickly disappearing from his subordinate&rsquo;s face. The subordinate even peeked toward Becrock before looking back at him.<br>That made the Tower Master even more curious. This was not someone who would make such motions for no reason.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember the Singten Merchant Guild which is one of the Empire&rsquo;s five largest merchant guilds and was close to the royal family in the capital?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you talking about guild leader Plavin Singten?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo;</p><p>He was an important merchant but not someone the Tower Master would easily meet without an appointment.</p><p>&ldquo;He says he has gathered around 1,200 slaves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</p><p>The Tower Master&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.</p><p>1,200 slaves.<br>That was not a small number.<br>It was quite large especially now when they could no longer conduct the slave trade they had been doing in secret.</p><p>The subordinate continued to speak with confidence.</p><p>&ldquo;We will be able to gain a lot of dead mana if we receive those slaves.&rdquo;</p><p>Dead mana.<br>It was a necessary ingredient for black magic as well as something they needed to offer to the White Star.</p><p>The Tower Master now understood why his subordinate had peeked toward mage Becrock. The Tower Master&rsquo;s shoulders opened wide with confidence. He peeked toward Becrock as he started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Ahem, this is great. Don't you agree?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, it is. You managed to get someone very useful on your side, Tower Master-nim. I knew there was a reason the Southern Tower was doing the best in comparison to the other three towers.&rdquo;</p><p>The Tower Master started to smile after hearing Becrock&rsquo;s comment.<br>Becrock would share similar sentiments to the White Star. That would raise the Tower Master's status as well.</p><p>&rsquo;I might even get to be the new Tower Master of the Alchemists&rsquo; Bell Tower.&rsquo;</p><p>That position was currently empty as the former Tower Master had died. The person in that position would lead all black mages and be close to the White Star.<br>If he could get that position!</p><p>The Tower Master pushed down his rising greed as he ordered his subordinate.</p><p>&ldquo;And you've confirmed these slaves?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course. Merchant guild leader Plavin brought a video recording device with him. I have confirmed the slaves chained down in the basement of his secret residence.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo;</p><p>The Tower Master was slowly starting to get excited.<br>The subordinate sounded prouder as well. Mage Becrock slowly moved away from the window and walked up to the two individuals.<br>This made the Tower Master and the subordinate even more excited.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir! There seemed to be hundreds of slaves in there, so I have no reasons to doubt the 1,200 number.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, I see! Is that why our Merchant guild leader Plavin wishes to meet me?&rdquo;</p><p>The corners of the subordinate&rsquo;s lips went up in a sly way.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir, he said he wishes to meet the person who will be the future owner of the Bell Tower.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ahem, the future of the Bell Tower? Ahem!&rdquo;</p><p>The Tower Master quickly responded without being able to hide his joy.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I need to see our Merchant guild leader Plavin&rsquo;s face at least once. I need to compliment him for doing such a good job.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, Tower Master-nim.&rdquo;</p><p>The subordinate responded but the Tower Master was looking at Becrock. His gaze seemed to be asking for Becrock&rsquo;s permission while reinforcing his worth to the White Star's needs.</p><p>&ldquo;Tower Master-nim, may I come with you? I want to meet such a talented merchant as well.&rdquo;</p><p>The Tower Master&rsquo;s expression became even brighter after hearing that Becrock wanted to come as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course! Let&rsquo;s go meet him right away! Prepare a spot on the tenth floor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, Tower Master-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>They could not meet him here on the ninth floor with all of these strategic documents.<br>The subordinate quickly closed the ninth floor window.<br>Then all three of them left the room and headed toward the tenth floor.<br>Click.<br>The door closed and someone locked it from the outside.</p><p>Swooooooosh-<br>Then a small gust of wind blew in toward a tiny crack in the window.</p><p>&rsquo;Opening window. Chaos, destruction, larceny!&rsquo;</p><p>Clang clang.<br>The lock on the window started to move.</p><p>&rsquo;...Larceny!&rsquo;</p><p>Then it managed to unlock.<br>Screeeech.<br>The window made a quiet noise as it opened wide.</p><ul><li>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any surveillance magic devices!</li></ul><p>Cale walked into the room while listening to Raon's voice. He looked around before starting to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess they were very happy. I didn&rsquo;t expect them to go see Plavin right away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Human! They&rsquo;re all so funny! Hehe!&rdquo;</p><p>Raon fluttered his wings in excitement.<br>Cale was already picking up a document as Raon laughed.</p><p>Flip. Flip.<br>The information in the documents were quickly being recorded in Cale&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>&ldquo;The humans in evil merchant guild leader Plavin&rsquo;s basement are all soldiers in disguises! They&rsquo;re all being tricked!&rdquo;<br>&rsquo;Kahahahahaha! Scam! Deception! Crime! Despair!&rsquo;</p><p>Raon and the Wind Elemental were not chatting with each other, but they were oddly saying similar things.<br>Cale was still busy recording but Raon continued to rattle on in excitement.</p><p>&ldquo;They'll get captured by the soldiers when they go to collect Plavin&rsquo;s slaves! We will smack them from behind!&rdquo;</p><p>Cale started to smile.</p><p>The soldiers in the capital.<br>These soldiers who were angry at Imperial Prince Adin and the royal family happily disguised themselves as slaves in Plavin&rsquo;s secret residence.</p><p>The Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower will send some forces to the residence to collect these disguised slaves.<br>1,200 was too big of a number to teleport or transport in the merchant guild&rsquo;s carriages.</p><p>&rsquo;Plavin will also say that he will not be able to move all of them himself.&rsquo;</p><p>The Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower's forces will be treated as criminals as they try to leave with the slaves.</p><p>&ldquo;But that Becrock bastard went with him, will grandpa Ron be okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Ron Molan was next to Plavin right now with his face under a mask.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s fine. Becrock&rsquo;s body is not normal right now. He didn't even notice us outside. Ron&rsquo;s stealth techniques are top notch. The current Becrock would not be able to tell if Ron hides his strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hehe, this is fun! I'm so excited!&rdquo;<br>&rsquo;Destruction, chaos! Kahahahaha!&rsquo;</p><p>Raon was flying around in circles in the air.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm so excited I want to spin in circles! But I'm not going nuts like the crown prince!&rdquo; <span id="footnote-ref-9f39"><a href="#footnote-9f39">[1]</a></span></p><p>Swoooooooosh-<br>A small breeze joined Raon in the air.</p><p>&rsquo;I'm going to spin too! Party! Joy! Despair!&rsquo;</p><p>Clap!<br>They heard a small clap at that moment. Raon looked toward Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;Human, are you done?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>There were no more documents in Cale&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Raon, make a call.&rdquo;</p><p>The corners of his lips were twisted up.</p><p>&ldquo;Who do you want me to call?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Call them in the order I tell you. As quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale told Raon the order to call people and Raon immediately called the first one.<br>Merchant guild leader Plavin will buy them as much time as possible.</p><ul><li>Huh? Young master-nim? Long time no see.<br>&ldquo;Tasha.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Dark Elf Tasha, crown prince Alberu's aunt.</p><ul><li>I sent the kids, young master Cale? Are you currently stealing something?<br>&ldquo;I'm going to speak quickly because I don't have much time.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Tasha sat up straight after hearing Cale&rsquo;s comment.</p><ul><li>Of course, go ahead.<br>&ldquo;Will it be okay to drag the White Star to the Land of Death?&rdquo;</li></ul><p>The Caro Kingdom&rsquo;s southern region.<br>Mary's neighborhood that is known as the Land of Death.</p><ul><li>Oh.</li></ul><p>Tasha let out a short gasp before asking.</p><ul><li>I'll need you to tell me more details.<br>&ldquo;Please come here. I do not have time.&rdquo;</li><li>That is fine. I will come to the Empire soon.</li></ul><p>The call ended.<br>Then the next call was placed right away.</p><ul><li>...Young master-nim?</li></ul><p>Cale joyfully greeted the person who seemed shocked to see him in a mask.</p><p>&ldquo;Marquis Taylor-nim, have you been well?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>...Young master-nim, what the f, mm, what is up with your appearance?</li><li>Oh! Young master-nim, what are you doing? Are you stealing something?</li></ul><p>He could see an anxious Taylor and an excited Cage through the screen. Cale started to talk to these two people showing very different reactions.</p><p>&ldquo;I will keep it short as I do not have much time.&rdquo;</p><p>The two of them quickly looked serious.</p><p>&ldquo;Marquis-nim, please hold off on the fake ancient document for now.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Excuse me?<br>&ldquo;And Miss Cage, please cuss out the God of Death for me.&rdquo;</li><li>Oh, should I do that?<br>&ldquo;And both of you.&rdquo;<br>Cale had a thought on his mind.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Can you both come to the Empire if you have some time?&rdquo;</p><p>The land of the Whale tribe at the Northern tip of the Western continent.<br>The Caro Kingdom&rsquo;s Land of Death located at the Western continent&rsquo;s western region.<br>And finally, the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s Northwest region on the eastern region of the Western continent.</p><p>A huge play that encompasses all three places filled Cale's mind.</p><ul><li>That is fine.</li><li>Sure. We&rsquo;ll be there!</li></ul><p>The third person they called greeted Cale from the other side of the screen.</p><ul><li>Cale-nim, you seem to be writing the legend from the back side of history once again.<br>&ldquo;Clopeh.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Cale looked at Clopeh's white hair as he continued to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Stealthily come to the Empire.&rdquo;</p><p>As Clopeh's green eyes started to show confusion...</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s increase the playing field.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>I understand, Cale-nim. I finally get to be a part in the leg-</li></ul><p>Click.<br>The call ended.<br>Cale closed his eyes while Raon connected the last call.</p><p>Clopeh Sekka from the North.<br>Tasha from the Land of Death.<br>Taylor Stan from the Roan Kingdom&rsquo;s Northwest region.</p><p>The three of them and himself.<br>And the White Star.</p><p>&ldquo;...I will take away what you wrongfully believed as yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale would take away the White Star&rsquo;s wish as the White Star had taken away Raon's future and Lord Sheritt&rsquo;s dream.</p><p>Anger? Revenge?<br>It wasn&rsquo;t something like that.<br>It was just because it was beneficial.</p><ul><li>Young master-nim.</li><li>Cale!</li></ul><p>He could see the people on the other side of the screen for this last call.<br>They were necromancer Mary and Mercenary King Bud Illis.</p><p>&ldquo;I have figured out the enemy&rsquo;s attack routes.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale started to explain the routes for all four directions. Once Bud wrote all of them down...</p><p>&ldquo;Bud, contact Hannah, Sir Rex, Jack-nim, and Rei Stecker.&rdquo;</p><p>Bud jumped up with the paper detailing the routes in his hand.<br>His eyes were waiting for what Cale would say next.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell them to get started.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>...Okay.</li></ul><p>Once Cale's words are delivered to them...<br>They would immediately start to move toward the four Alchemists&rsquo; Towers.<br>The troops waiting to leave the capital would start to move.</p><p>&ldquo;Mary.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Yes, young master-nim.</li></ul><p>There were a few Dark Elves behind Mary. They were reinforcements from the Land of Death.<br>Cale started to speak to them.</p><p>&ldquo;I figured out where they are storing the dead mana.&rdquo;</p><p>The location of the dead mana storage facilities for all four directions.</p><p>&ldquo;Start the hunt.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary bowed.<br>All of the dead mana in the Empire will soon be taken by Mary and the Dark Elves.</p><p>&ldquo;Tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale said the last thing as he ended the call.</p><p>&ldquo;The Southern Alchemists&rsquo; Tower will explode tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>This was the start of war.</p><hr><div id="footnote-9f39"><p>1. spinning and going nuts are homophones in Korean. <a href="#footnote-ref-9f39"><svg class="svg-inline--fa fa-hand-point-left fa-w-16" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="far" data-icon="hand-point-left" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" data-fa-i2svg=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M0 220.8C0 266.416 37.765 304 83.2 304h35.647a93.148 93.148 0 0 0 7.929 22.064c-2.507 22.006 3.503 44.978 15.985 62.791C143.9 441.342 180.159 480 242.701 480H264c60.063 0 98.512-40 127.2-40h2.679c5.747 4.952 13.536 8 22.12 8h64c17.673 0 32-12.894 32-28.8V188.8c0-15.906-14.327-28.8-32-28.8h-64c-8.584 0-16.373 3.048-22.12 8H391.2c-6.964 0-14.862-6.193-30.183-23.668l-.129-.148-.131-.146c-8.856-9.937-18.116-20.841-25.851-33.253C316.202 80.537 304.514 32 259.2 32c-56.928 0-92 35.286-92 83.2 0 8.026.814 15.489 2.176 22.4H83.2C38.101 137.6 0 175.701 0 220.8zm48 0c0-18.7 16.775-35.2 35.2-35.2h158.4c0-17.325-26.4-35.2-26.4-70.4 0-26.4 20.625-35.2 44-35.2 8.794 0 20.445 32.712 34.926 56.1 9.074 14.575 19.524 27.225 30.799 39.875 16.109 18.374 33.836 36.633 59.075 39.596v176.752C341.21 396.087 309.491 432 264 432h-21.299c-40.524 0-57.124-22.197-50.601-61.325-14.612-8.001-24.151-33.979-12.925-53.625-19.365-18.225-17.787-46.381-4.95-61.05H83.2C64.225 256 48 239.775 48 220.8zM448 360c13.255 0 24 10.745 24 24s-10.745 24-24 24-24-10.745-24-24 10.745-24 24-24z"></path></svg><!-- <i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i> --></a></p></div> <a href="./chapter403.html" class="chapter-nav">
