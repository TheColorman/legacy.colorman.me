<p>&ldquo;...You're going to go through all of these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mercenary King urgently chased behind Cale, who was heading toward the center of the area that was full of thousands of books. He seemed to be nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale, I remember what you told me when you made me the offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud Illis recalled the things Cale told him the first time they met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked me to show you the Directory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Directory was not a file that even the Mercenary King could easily show others. However, he still brought Cale here, even acting stealthily in the process.<br>
There was a simple reason for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you needed to know the White Star&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale turned his head and looked toward the Mercenary King.</p>
<p>The Mercenary King flinched.</p>
<p>It was because Cale&rsquo;s eyes did not look human for a moment.</p>
<p>They were cold and emotionless. It was as if he was looking at an object.<br>
However, those thoughts quickly disappeared once Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>Cale had not told the Mercenary King much information about the White Star. However, it was time to share some details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Star is a reincarnator who has gone through many lives for approximately 1,000 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was enough.<br>
Cale confirmed the Mercenary King's expression changing before turning back around and heading toward the records.</p>
<p>Bud just blankly stared at Cale&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Pat. Pat. </p>
<p>He only returned to his senses and started to speak after the ancient Dragon patted his shoulders before walking past him. The ancient Dragon was approaching Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Eruhaben-nim, are you saying the White Star is someone who repeatedly died and was born again?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes. He reincarnated over and over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eruhaben looked toward Cale who stopped in front of a desk and was looking around before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why we came here to look for records about him. He should have left traces throughout the Eastern and Western continents during his reincarnations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud quickly responded back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...There&rsquo;s no way that we have no records on such a strong individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Bud's lips opened and closed a few times without saying anything before he stopped hesitating and continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, it is close to impossible to find traces of him in these tens of thousands of books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the current Mercenary King, he had the most knowledge about these records than any other living being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each book has hundreds of people listed in it. It is ... Almost not realistic to go through hundreds of thousands of individuals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He peeked toward Ron Molan before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I have a good knowledge of all of the strong individuals in the past fifty years. Those are considered the, &rsquo;currently recording,&rsquo; information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ron Molan was an example of a strong individual from the Eastern continent whose traces had disappeared.<br>
That was why the Mercenaries Guild was keeping his record under the, &rsquo;currently recording,&rsquo; status.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Around two hundred years might be doable, but a thousand years is just-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Bud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone cut him off.<br>
It was Cale.</p>
<p>"Where is the first-ever record?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haaaaaaaaa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud sighed at Cale who seemed ready to start looking from the first-ever record. He quickly walked over to Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale, are you planning on spending the next few years in here? Hmm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud was getting frustrated.<br>
He didn't understand why such a smart person would pick such a method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sure it will be helpful to look up his past since the White Star is a reincarnator. However, there are 1,000 years worth of records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud picked up a book from the bookshelf and opened it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has each strong individual's birth, date, and general information about their lives. Furthermore, we also record the powers they use. Each book has hundreds of such records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud had felt like he was going to suffocate when he first became the Mercenary King and came in here.<br>
He was overwhelmed by the information.</p>
<p>At the same time, it helped him understand how the Mercenaries Guild was able to remain a strong force in the Eastern continent without having any land of their own.</p>
<p>They had records that were just as valuable as land.<br>
In some aspects, this was the scariest power.<br>
That was the overwhelming nature of these records.</p>
<p>Bud started to point out the issues in Cale's plans one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if you start reading from the first record, it would be difficult to remember the first strong individual in the book by the time you are only a third of the way through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even a person with a good memory would find it difficult to remember over thirty people&rsquo;s information.<br>
Just looking through three of the books would make it confusing to remember which information belonged to whom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, how do you plan on finding traces of the White Star? How will you be able to tell which strong individual was the White Star's first incarnation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud had smelled quite a number of scents coming from the White Star.<br>
He had a variety of ancient powers like Cale such that it was difficult to accurately pinpoint everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plus, Cale, don't you need to quickly capture the White Star? What you are trying to do will require a bunch of people working nonstop for months, no, years to achieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was impossible to just read and remember all of these records.<br>
You had to divide up the task with others.</p>
<p>Bud then said the thing that confused him the most.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sure you know about this fact more than anybody else. So why are you doing this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale picked up the book that Bud pulled out and turned the pages.</p>
<p>Shhh.</p>
<p>The pages that were stiff like new books thanks to the preservation magic quickly turned one by one.<br>
Bud who was watching this could not help but speak again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale Henituse, this-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud flinched. </p>
<p>He was not the only one. <br>
The rest of the group who were busy looking around at the area focused on Cale.<br>
Bud asked the calm Cale a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;What did he just say?<br>
He is capable of doing what I just talked about?<br>
But how?<br>
...I don&rsquo;t smell such an ability on him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bud looked at Cale smile as Cale stopped looking at the book and turned back toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, one week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale did not plan on staying here for a long time either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will find the first within that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strong individual he believed to be the first incarnation of the White Star.<br>
If he finds that person's birth and death, then he just needed to look for the next information based on the time of death.</p>
<p>Cale's group knew about the White Star&rsquo;s Dragon Slayer powers and ancient powers. Of course, Bud did not know the details because none of them had told him yet.<br>
Cale&rsquo;s group had a decent amount of knowledge on the White Star&rsquo;s powers.<br>
That was why it was possible to find the first incarnation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...How? How will you find the first incarnation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale chuckled while looking at Bud who was standing there with a blank expression on his face.<br>
It was similar to the expressions people had when Kim Rok Soo had first awakened.</p>
<p>Kill or be killed.<br>
Live or let live.</p>
<p>The war between monsters and humans.<br>
The war between humans and humans.</p>
<p>It was a world full of destruction because of all of that.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had been determined to have awakened an ability that was useless in such a world, an ability that would only help him in a peaceful world.</p>
<p>However, that power allowed Kim Rok Soo to keep living without dying.<br>
He confidently answered the confused Bud&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud stood there quietly for a while before pointing to a location.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The innermost shelf. The first book on the bottom left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale walked toward the location Bud had pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That book is the first record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard Bud&rsquo;s voice coming from behind him as he pulled out the first book from the bookshelf. He then started to turn the pages.</p>
<p>Flip, flip.</p>
<p>Only the sound of pages turning could be heard.<br>
Cale just stood there reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud let out a gasp at Cale's actions. However, he made eye contact with the others before walking toward the innermost bookshelf as well.<br>
He needed to help Cale.<br>
He couldn&rsquo;t just stand there and do nothing.</p>
<p>However, the group of people heading toward Cale had to stop.<br>
Bud was the first to stop.<br>
Next were Eruhaben, Choi Han, Ron, and Beacrox.<br>
Even the children averaging nine-years-old flinched.</p>
<p>Flip, flip, flip.</p>
<p>They just heard the sound of pages turning.<br>
That was why they felt that something was off.</p>
<p>Flip, flip, flip.</p>
<p>It was quiet around Cale.<br>
He was just quietly turning the pages.</p>
<p>That was the weird part.</p>
<p>Bud had no choice but to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...What is up with his speed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flip. Flip.</p>
<p>At first, it didn't seem very odd.<br>
Cale was turning pages at a reasonable pace.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...It was as if he was reading a novel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bud then realized that it had been weird from the beginning.</p>
<p>Flip. Flip. Flip.</p>
<p>Cale was slowly turning the pages faster and faster. It seemed as if he was just taking a peek before turning the page.<br>
Bud even had this kind of thought.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Is he not thoroughly going through and remembering the details about each strong individual?<br>
Is he just quickly skimming through?&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, the feeling Cale was giving off did not seem that way.<br>
He seemed to be thoroughly reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale raised his head after hearing someone calling his name.<br>
The ancient Dragon observed Cale's eyes with an odd expression on his face. Cale's expression was same, but his eyes felt cold.<br>
The ancient Dragon could not ask many questions. He used his memory of everything Cale had done as the basis to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're remembering all of it, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;You're not just skimming it, you actually remember the information, right?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cale answered the ancient Dragon's question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale answered in his usual nonchalant way before resuming reading. His reddish brown eyes looked at the text inside the book.</p>
<p>Flip.</p>
<p>He turned a page.<br>
The information on the page became recorded in his mind. The speed continued to increase.</p>
<p>Bud could only quietly watch Cale.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...What a scary ability.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He really thought that this ability was scary.<br>
It was different than the fancy magic, destructive aura, and even the different types of ancient powers. This ability was something that was not visible.</p>
<p>It was so unnoticeable that you would not even realize that he was using an ability if you did not look closely.</p>
<p>It was not an ability that could kill someone, but Bud thought that this ability was really the one that would make it easy to kill or control someone.</p>
<p>Everything would be recorded in the user&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Bud could only gulp and watch.<br>
However, he soon heard someone walking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale raised his head after hearing the cautious calling. Choi Han was looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I wish to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choi Han smiled awkwardly at Cale who was looking at him and continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I am a slow reader and my memory is not that good, but I thought I could still help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale recalled some memories of his past.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Team leader-nim, shall I help?&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time to go home?&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s okay.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;Like hell it&rsquo;s okay. Isn&rsquo;t your kid waiting for you at home? Go home.&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;But...&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;It's fastest and most accurate for me to do it. You don't need to do this part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He moved the conversation he had with one of his subordinates to a corner of his mind as he raised his hand.<br>
He then pointed to the second bookshelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be good to look through there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was rare for Cale to not give detailed orders.<br>
However, Choi Han smiled and walked over to the second bookshelf. Eruhaben and Beacrox followed behind him.</p>
<p>Ron stood next to Cale and just looked at him.<br>
Ron's gaze made Cale subconsciously start to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...What is it? Are you shocked that I have an ability like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale closed his mouth after saying that. He was thinking that he said something he should not have said.<br>
He heard Ron responding to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I'm sure you just hid it, young master-nim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ron had a benign smile on his face as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you told us how you gathered all of those ancient powers either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shield, the fiery thunderbolt, the Super Rock, etc.</p>
<p>Cale had never explained to the group how he had gained all of these ancient powers. He always just disappeared before returning with an extra ancient power.</p>
<p>Cale had a random thought that it would be frustrating to have a group member like himself. The old man continued to speak as Cale found it even harder to say anything after having that thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking at the books like the others is not my task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ron continued to speak to the twenty years old Cale who was quietly looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your servant, young master-nim. Tending to your needs by your side is my role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ron then just quietly stood next to Cale.<br>
Cale quietly looked at Ron for a moment before turning back to the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...I guess that is your role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale also realized what his role was as well.</p>
<p>Flip. Flip.</p>
<p>He was quickly turning pages as he heard another voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, the great and mighty Raon Miru can read quickly! My memory is good as well! I am smart, great, and mighty! That is why I will do it too!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;...I...I learned how to read from Hans and grandpa Ron! I&rsquo;m going to do it too!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I'm already reading one!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Noona, you really are amazing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale chuckled while listening to the children averaging nine-years-old.</p>
<p>However, the large records library soon became quiet.</p>
<p>Flip. Flip.</p>
<p>Only the sound of pages being turned could be heard.<br>
Cale then heard Beacrox ask a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What exactly are we looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale thought about the White Star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gather any record on strong individuals who use the Dragon Slayer's powers or ancient powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A response came from someone else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that power the Dragon Slayer&rsquo;s power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Bud. He touched his nose as he walked over to the second bookshelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Star had a unique scent along with the scent of ancient powers. Then I should help as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud thought about the information he gathered on the White Star through his scent and turned a page.</p>
<p>However, there was a unique sound through the process.</p>
<p>Flip, flip, flip.</p>
<p>It was the sound of pages turning extremely quickly.<br>
Bud imagined Cale becoming a living record as he focused on reading the record in front of him.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rsquo;Mm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ron groaned internally.</p>
<p>This was an area where the temperature was maintained all the time.<br>
There should be no reason for someone to sweat.</p>
<p>He moved his hand.<br>
The handkerchief in his hand landed on someone's forehead.</p>
<p>&rsquo;...Why is he sweating so much?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ron Molan could see Cale who was sweating profusely.<br>
Cale's face had become extremely red as well.</p>
<p>The records storage area was chilly, but Cale was heating up as if he was sick.<br>
However, he did not stop and continued to record the information.</p>
<p>There were close to ten thousand record books behind his back as if they were his footprints.</p> <a href="./chapter358.html" class="chapter-nav">
