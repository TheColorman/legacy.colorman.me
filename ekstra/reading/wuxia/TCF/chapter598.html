<p>Inside the dark subway tunnel...</p><p>The rose gold light that was as red as blood flowed out in all directions.</p><p>Baaaaaang!</p><p>The loud noise that sounded as if the entire tunnel would crumble shook the surrounding area.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Kang Hoon subconsciously took a few steps back.</p><p>His eyes were in pain from the sudden bright light.</p><p>He could not hide his shock.</p><p>&ldquo;...Such strength-!&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;He had such strength?&rsquo;</p><p>He had heard a lot of people talk about Kim Rok Soo&rsquo;s strength, but it was completely different seeing it in person.</p><p>&rsquo;He has foresight and a thunderbolt like this-!&rsquo;</p><p>Kim Kang Hoon heard Lee Seung Won, who was on his back, start to speak at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all.&rdquo;<br>"What?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...Ho.&rdquo;</p><p>He could only gasp in shock as he stepped farther back.</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&rdquo;</p><p>He gasped once more.</p><p>As the rose gold light disappeared...</p><p>&ldquo;...I guess it is an unranked monster even when it is split into two!&rdquo;</p><p>The blue headed monster that had curled up its body could be seen.</p><p>Bae Puh Rum shouted as well.</p><p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any injuries!&rdquo;</p><p>He recalled what Cale had said.</p><p>&rsquo;This Electric Eel has scales. They&rsquo;re so strong that most attacks won't even leave a scratch.&rsquo;</p><p>He had also said something else.</p><p>&rsquo;That is why we need rescue team leader Lee Soo Hyuk.&rsquo;</p><p>Bae Puh Rum looked toward the spot where the rose gold light had disappeared.</p><p>In the short opening created when the blue head that was curled up slowly raised its head...</p><p>He could see Lee Soo Hyuk running toward that opening.</p><p>&rsquo;The blue head will curl up and protect itself with its scales when I attack.&rsquo;</p><p>That was their chance.</p><p>&rsquo;Leader Lee Soo Hyuk will definitely create an opening.&rsquo;</p><p>Kim Rok Soo's voice echoed on his mind.</p><p>At that moment...</p><p>&ldquo;How disappointing.&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk and the blue monster&rsquo;s eyes met.</p><p>Smile.</p><p>The corners of Lee Soo Hyuk's lips started to go up.</p><p>&ldquo;I was planning on chopping off your poisonous fangs first, but I guess I'll just have to put that off until later.&rdquo;</p><p>His sword then slashed sideways.</p><p>Kim Min Ah started to speak while standing next to Bae Puh Rum.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no noise.&rdquo;</p><p>The sword was swung.</p><p>However, there was no noise at all.</p><p>Joo Ho-Shik started to frown.</p><p>&ldquo;...Is he cutting the wind as well?&rdquo;</p><p>There wasn't a black aura like Choi Han.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t like Kim Min Ah&rsquo;s attack that caused a gust of wind or an earthquake due to its strength.</p><p>A fancy rose gold light or a shield did not appear as with Cale.</p><p>All he did was silently swing his sword sideways.</p><p>But Cale could see the drops of sweat gathering on Lee Soo Hyuk&rsquo;s forehead.</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk gave everything he had to this silent action.</p><p>His sword, his attribute, activated its powers stronger than ever before in response to Lee Soo Hyuk giving it his all.</p><p>Slash!</p><p>These scales that Cale wouldn't have been able to damage even if he used any or all of his current half-powered ancient powers together...</p><p>A portion of those scales was slashed.</p><p>Slaaaaaash!</p><p>The tender skin underneath the damaged scales was cut open and blue blood shot out.</p><p>Compared to this large and long body...</p><p>This small injury was extremely small.</p><p>It was only about half the size of an adult woman&rsquo;s palm.</p><p>The reason that people were able to survive the attack of the first unranked monster in the past...</p><p>It had a lot to do with Lee Soo Hyuk's power.</p><p>&ldquo;...Huff.&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk stumbled and knelt down after creating that opening.</p><p>&ldquo;You worked hard, sir.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...You&rsquo;re speaking respectfully again?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale supported Lee Soo Hyuk from behind.</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk's back was completely drenched in sweat.</p><p>At that moment...</p><p>&ldquo;Screeeeeeeeeech!&rdquo;</p><p>The blue monster that had never expected a sword to cause it an injury screamed and raised its body.</p><p>Blood dripped down from the cut, but the monster was so angry that it did not care.</p><p>They could feel the monster preparing to release its powers in anger.</p><p>&ldquo;...It truly is no joke as you mentioned. I could only cause that small injury while using this much of my strength.&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk scoffed before using his sword as support to stand up.</p><p>He had won most fights in the end until now.</p><p>But he felt something while looking at this unranked monster.</p><p>&rsquo;I wouldn't have been able to defeat this monster if I wasn&rsquo;t prepared.&rsquo;</p><p>And if he had tried to carry the weight of everything on his own...</p><p>Not only would he have had to use all of his strength, but he would also have had to put his life on the line.</p><p>&rsquo;But not now.&rsquo;</p><p>He had created an opening.</p><p>&rsquo;Now then, next!&rsquo;</p><p>It was someone else&rsquo;s turn now.</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk felt Cale pushing him back down and started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Park Jin Tae!&rdquo;</p><p>The opening.</p><p>The opening that was half the size of a cheek.</p><p>It looked small, but it was quite large for a certain someone.</p><p>Especially since that person was Park Jin Tae who had a gun in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Huuuuuu.&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae let out a deep breath.</p><p>The barrel of his gun had already been pointed at the opening from the moment Lee Soo Hyuk had slashed it open.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>The moment the blue head noticed Park Jin Tae...</p><p>&ldquo;You're too late.&rdquo;</p><p>Park Jin Tae had already pulled the trigger.</p><p>Tang! Tang!</p><p>Two bullets shot out in succession.</p><p>&ldquo;Chhhhhhhhhh!&rdquo;</p><p>The blue head tried to twist its body to dodge the things it would have normally scoffed at that were flying toward it.</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t easy.</p><p>This subway tunnel only left a bit of open space for a monster of its size.</p><p>Choosing to split into two and make itself weaker for stealthy movement...</p><p>Choosing to go through this narrow tunnel...</p><p>When those things became an obstacle for the monster...</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>One bullet hit the wall of the subway tunnel and exploded.</p><p>As for the remaining bullet...</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooooooooooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>It pierced into the monster&rsquo;s injury and exploded.</p><p>The exposed skin without any protection was no longer gushing out blue blood. Once the explosion happened, the injury opened farther and it started bleeding black.</p><p>&ldquo;Screeeeeeech! Roooooooooooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>The monster twisted its body in pain.</p><p>But even that was not easy in this narrow tunnel.</p><p>There were still many hunters left.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p><p>A person reported to Cale before darting forward toward the blue head.</p><p>It was Kim Min Ah.</p><p>Her eyes were focused on the flailing blue monster&rsquo;s body.</p><p>&rsquo;Your accuracy still needs work.&rsquo;</p><p>Kim Rok Soo had said that to Kim Min Ah after their few days of training had come to an end.</p><p>&rsquo;But I won't tell you the direction this time. You need to aim on your own.&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Will that be okay?&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Of course.&rsquo;</p><p>Kim Min Ah could feel the wind that was surrounding her body as she moved forward.</p><p>This wind belonged to Kim Rok Soo, who was paler now after using the rose gold thunderbolt.</p><p>Kim Rok Soo had added the wind for her, but it was up to Kim Min Ah to decide how the wind would move.</p><p>&rsquo;Your strength is the greatest.&rsquo;</p><p>She swung a spear.</p><p>&rsquo;You should be able to pierce through it even without perfect aim as long as even a bit of it touches that injury.&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;You don&rsquo;t need me to hit it perfectly?&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve worked hard the last few days. It should work since you trained hard.&rsquo;</p><p>She had trained hard.</p><p>She had trained a lot as well.</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t recall how much sweat she had shed in the training ground with Bae Puh Rum.</p><p>She clenched her hand.</p><p>Crack.</p><p>The spear cracked a little under the pressure of her strength.</p><p>She was not using the weapon she usually summoned.</p><p>That was why it now had a crack.</p><p>The blue head twisted its body in order to dodge the spear.</p><p>Her spear did not manage to reach the opening on the blue-headed monster&rsquo;s wound.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Baaaaang!</p><p>&ldquo;Screeeeeeeeeech!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ugh! You should know that I'm here too! I can't let our Min Ah's attack end up missing.&rdquo;</p><p>Bae Puh Rum was surrounded by the wind as he slammed into the blue head.</p><p>That made the monster return to its original position.</p><p>They had planned for Bae Puh Rum to do this.</p><p>The monster's injury ended up being located exactly where Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum had planned.</p><p>&ldquo;Bae Puh Rum, good job.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>Thanks to him, her spear ended up landing on target.</p><p>Craaaaaack!</p><p>She heard it crack.</p><p>&ldquo;Hooo.&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Kang Hoon gasped.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew it! I knew they could do it!&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Seung Won was cheering.</p><p>The injury caused by Lee Soo Hyuk and expanded by Park Jin Tae...</p><p>There was a steel spear that was somewhat crushed from Kim Min Ah&rsquo;s Herculean Strength stabbed into that spot.</p><p>Kim Min Ah had stabbed the spear into the monster&rsquo;s body, all the way down to its bones.</p><p>&ldquo;Huuuuuu, huuuuuu.&rdquo;</p><p>Although it was only half of the monster, it still took a lot of strength to stab an unranked monster with enough force to pierce a weapon into its bone.</p><p>&ldquo;...Haaa.&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Min Ah continued to breathe heavily.</p><p>Kim Kang Hoon's eyes opened wide at that moment and he started to shout.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Huh? Dodge!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chhhhhhhhhh!&rdquo;</p><p>The monster glared at Kim Min Ah and charged toward her.</p><p>&ldquo;Roooooar!&rdquo;</p><p>There were two large fangs visible in its open mouth.</p><p>Those fangs were dripping black liquids and looked ready to pierce right through her.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>The moment Kim Kang Hoon heard Lee Seung Won's confident voice...</p><p>&ldquo;Did I do well?&rdquo;</p><p>Bae Puh Rum quickly flew over, hugged her, and retreated.</p><p>This area might be narrow for the monster, but it was wide for humans, allowing him to quickly move around.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. You did well.&rdquo;</p><p>Kim Min Ah patted Bae Puh Rum&rsquo;s head and then looked toward Kim Rok Soo.</p><p>"Good job."</p><p>Kim Min Ah started to smile once she saw Cale's mouth form what seemed to be those words.</p><p>Cale smiled as well.</p><p>The steel spear stabbed into the blue head&rsquo;s body...</p><p>And the fact that the blue head&rsquo;s ability was water...</p><p>"Why aren&rsquo;t you using your ability?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chhhhhhhhhh!&rdquo;</p><p>The blue head glared at Cale.</p><p>It realized that the leader and the person who would land the final attack was Cale.</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to mumble while looking at the blue monster that was glaring at Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;Steel and water. It should work properly this time.&rdquo;</p><p>Crackle. Crack.</p><p>&ldquo;Kim Rok Soo&rsquo;s thunderbolt should work.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale&rsquo;s entire body was surrounded by rose gold thunderbolts once again.</p><p>A person next to Cale clasped his hands together.</p><p>&ldquo;I have faith.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Joo Ho-Shik.</p><p>&ldquo;I have faith that the Commander-nim&rsquo;s thunderbolt will follow the spear into that monster's body and make that bastard perish!&rdquo;</p><p>His gaze and his faith headed toward Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;I have faith!&rdquo;</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>The rose gold light became even stronger.</p><p>Cale felt the power of the Fire of Destruction with his entire body as he started to think.</p><p>&rsquo;...I will give it my best.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale decided to use as much strength as he could possibly use in the present situation.</p><p>He needed to do that this time.</p><p>&rsquo;The yellow head......!&rsquo;</p><p>There was one more bastard to take down.</p><p>Choi Han and the others should be holding that bastard back right now.</p><p>This group needed to quickly meet up with them over there.</p><p>Cale noticed the blue head look somewhere at that moment.</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Above!&rdquo;</p><p>The blue head had already changed directions by the time he had shouted.</p><p>The blue head headed for the ceiling of the subway tunnel.</p><p>The others started to run toward the blue head at the same time.</p><p>"We were expecting that!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bae Puh Rum, shut up and attack!&rdquo;</p><p>Bae Puh Rum and Kim Min Ah recalled what Cale had said.</p><p>&rsquo;If it keeps being attacked and is placed in a dangerous situation, the monster will try to get out of the tunnel and head above ground.&rsquo;</p><p>The two of them had wondered if that would be bad.</p><p>However...</p><p>&rsquo;But it doesn't matter.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale picked up the walkie-talkie and started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Please get it ready.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Yes, sir. I got it.</li></ul><p>Jo Min Yeh would be up there even if the blue head managed to make it out.</p><p>Jo Min Yeh, the spider web fisherwoman.</p><p>The spider web she casts was a thicker web than anything in the world.</p><p>Even if the blue head managed to make a hole in the ceiling, Jo Min Yeh's spider web would be waiting for it.</p><p>That was why Cale had said the following to the others.</p><p>&rsquo;Once the blue head is flustered because of the spider web...<br>I will kill it.&rsquo;</p><p>Crackle.</p><p>Cale headed toward the blue monster that was pushing its head into the ceiling.</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s possible.&rsquo;</p><p>It was possible to hunt them one by one without having anybody die.</p><p>Cale had that thought and channeled even more of his Fire of Destruction into his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I have faith!&rdquo;</p><p>Joo Ho-Shik shouted and the others prepared to attack to support Cale.</p><p>&ldquo;I'll slash off one of the poisonous fangs for now.&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Lee Soo Hyuk next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Pffft.&rdquo;</p><p>Cale started to laugh after hearing that even though he was extremely tense.</p><p>&ldquo;If you have time to say that- mm?&rdquo;</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Cale saw something.</p><p>&ldquo;Our dear Commander Rok Soo. What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk found Cale's reaction odd and looked at him before turning toward where Cale was looking.</p><p>He then saw it.</p><p>"A horn?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a horn coming out of the blue head&rsquo;s forehead.</p><p>He then had a thought.</p><p>&rsquo;Rok Soo never mentioned a horn?&rsquo;</p><p>He had not heard about a horn at all.</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk quickly started to turn toward Cale after realizing that.</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk was the only one who could hear Cale&rsquo;s quiet mumbling.</p><p>&ldquo;...It&rsquo;s different than the record.&rdquo;</p><p>&rsquo;Record?&rsquo;</p><p>Lee Soo Hyuk's gaze was focused on Cale.</p><p>However, Cale had no time to pay any attention to Lee Soo Hyuk.</p><p>It was because something else he had not expected had happened as well.</p><p>Piiiiiiiiiiiiii-</p><p>There was a sharp noise coming through the walkie-talkie.</p><p>&rsquo;An emergency signal!&rsquo;</p><p>This was the noise for when there was an urgent situation.</p><p>Cale turned on the walkie-talkie and heard Choi Han's voice.</p><ul><li>Rok Soo hyung! It has one more ability!<br>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to frown in shock.</p><p>On the other hand, Cale&rsquo;s gaze started to sink.</p><p>&rsquo;I knew it-&rsquo;</p><p>Why had Cale continued to be tense while preparing to fight this unranked monster when his record should have had all the information?</p><p>Why had Cale gathered as many people as possible even though his record told him all of the monster's weaknesses?</p><p>It was because of a simple reason.</p><p>&rsquo;The record&rsquo;s blind spot.&rsquo;</p><p>There were times his record did not have all the facts.</p><p>&rsquo;Just like what happened right now.&rsquo;</p><p>The appearance of the first unranked monster.</p><p>All of the records he had about this incident were based on the memories of the survivors because it was before the new system had been created.</p><p>In that case...</p><p>Couldn't their memories have been wrong?</p><p>Or...</p><p>&rsquo;It's possible that they did not see all of the monster's abilities.&rsquo;</p><p>Wasn&rsquo;t it possible the monster had more abilities than they had seen?</p><p>The battle against the first unranked monster had been when most people had not properly developed their abilities to their fullest extent.</p><p>Their judgments and experience were lacking compared to the future as well.</p><p>There could be missing variables in his record.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The now horned blue head slammed its horn into the ceiling.</p><p>Craaaaaaack. Craaaaaaack.</p><p>The ceiling slowly started to crack.</p><p>But it did not matter. Jo Min Yeh's spider web and people to help her should be waiting above.</p><p>&rsquo;But the situation had changed.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han. What is the yellow head&rsquo;s other ability?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Baaaaang! Bang!</li></ul><p>He could hear loud noises and things breaking coming from the other side of the walkie-talkie.</p><p>Things were urgent on that side as well.</p><p>No, it should be even harder than this side.</p><p>Cale started to frown.</p><p>&ldquo;Choi Han!&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Choi Han urgently responding after he shouted Choi Han&rsquo;s name once more with anxiety.</p><ul><li>Earth! Or maybe dirt!</li></ul><p>&rsquo;Earth? Dirt?&rsquo;</p><ul><li>The yellow head has currently changed directions and is digging through the ground!</li></ul><p>Cale made eye contact with Lee Soo Hyuk at that moment.</p><p>Both of them realized it at the same time.</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s coming.&rsquo;</p><p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s heading over.&rsquo;</p><p>Cale&rsquo;s gaze slowly headed back toward the blue head.</p><ul><li>The yellow head is moving south! It is heading toward Daeyeon station!</li></ul><p>The yellow head was heading over here toward the blue head.</p> <a href="./chapter597.html" class="chapter-nav">
