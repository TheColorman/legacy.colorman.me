    <p>
      Before anyone could grow comfortable or
      complacent with it, winter vacation ends. The only special thing that
      happened during that time was that I made the customary visit to the
      shrine on New Year’s with , but other than that, there was nothing else of
      note. As the third term starts, starts to isolate herself even more. Even
      I could tell she was trying to stay away from other people as much as pos-
      sible. After school, she likes to look out the window when everyone else
      has left, but it would always be Shiki that waits, just like today. I keep
      her company, even though she hasn’t said that she wants me to. She needs
      it, I think. The winter evenings come earlier, and the sunset that heralds
      it bathes the classroom in a deep red light. The bright light makes the
      shadows that play across the classroom’s walls even darker, and Shiki’s
      shadow is no exception. She leans against the window before she begins to
      talk. “Say, Kokutō. Did I ever tell you that I hate people?” “Not really.”
      I reply with the tone that implies skepticism at where this topic is
      going. “Well, congratulations, now you know. ’ a misanthrope, been one
      since she was a kid. See, when you’re a kid, you don’t know nothing yet,
      right? You think every random Joe you meet on the street loves ya, just
      like that. I mean, you love yourself, so it’s common sense that they must
      like you too, right?” “I suppose. When you’re a kid, you still trust
      everyone. When you’re a kid, you’re scared of ghosts. When you grow up,
      you get scared of other people.” “Right. But that ignorance is what’s
      really important, Kokutō. It never occurs to you that your best friend
      could be a murderer, or that your neigh- bor could be killing puppies in
      his spare time. You don’t suspect. And since you don’t know anything,
      other people will accept you. And no matter how fake that is, it’s
      important, since you’ll be able to love other people too. People can only
      express the emotions they know, after all.” The sunset paints her face
      red, and her eyes acquire that peculiar gaze of hers, reminiscent of the
      kind of casual, perhaps feigned disdain of a predator hiding its
      intentions from its prey. Right now, I can’t tell which Shiki she
      currently is. Maybe it doesn’t even matter. “But it was different for me.
      Since the day I was born, had me inside of her, so she already knew of
      other people. I didn’t love her, and so she learned that it was possible
      for people not to love. Ever since she was a kid, she learned how ugly
      people can be on the inside, and so she couldn’t love other people. In
      time, that tempered to rejection, and then disinterest.” And that’s how I
      grew to dislike people, her eyes seemed to conclude. “But weren’t you
      lonely like that?” I muse. “Why would I be? has me, doesn’t she? She was
      isolated from soci- ety, sure, but alone? Never.” She tries her best to
      look like she really means it. “But lately,” she continues, “ has been
      acting kinda weird. She’s been trying harder and harder to deny her
      abnormality. Denial is what I do. She’s only supposed to affirm.” Shiki
      laughs bitterly at their private joke, her sinister smile betraying the
      brutality beneath. “Kokutō, have you ever wanted to kill someone?” At that
      moment, the sun shone in a peculiar way, making her face take on a deep,
      crimson, almost blood-stained look, and it made my heart jump. “Not
      really, no. Probably the furthest I’ve ever thought in that vein is
      wanting to punch someone.” “I see. But for me, that desire is all I have,”
      she declares, as her voice echoes across the empty classroom, now lit by a
      burning red sun. “What do you mean?” “All the things that really wants to
      do, all the things she holds back, I welcome with open arms. It’s my sole
      meaning and purpose, and it doesn’t make me unhappy at all to know that.
      And that’s why has always tried to suppress me. She always tries to kill
      the black stain in her that’s called Shiki. I’ve killed myself, over and
      over and over again. I told you, right? ‘People can only express the
      emotions they know?’ Well, the only emotion I’ve ever experienced…is
      murder.” She finally stands up from the windowsill, and without making so
      much as a sound, draws closer to me, and in that moment, I feel fear,
      genuine fear, in my heart. “And that’s why, Kokutō, ’ definition of
      murder,” she pauses and leans close to my ear, her murmur as audible as a
      shout, “is killing me. She kills anything that makes me want to come out.”
      And with her prankster smile grimly signaling the end of the conversa-
      tion, Shiki leaves the classroom. The day after, I try to pretend as if
      nothing happened. I go about the motions as usual, and of course this
      includes inviting to eat lunch together. “Wanna grab a bite with me?”
      “What…in the…” Her face betrays surprise, a face I’ve yet to see her put
      on until now, and yet with her voice wavering, she reluctantly accepts,
      perhaps to preserve routine more than anything. always liked going to the
      roof, and so we head there. We climb the stairs, with choosing to remain
      silent, but I knew her pointed stare of surprise and anger is boring a
      hole in my back. I know the reason why she’s mad. Even I could read
      between the lines of what Shiki said yesterday. But it’s not like she
      hasn’t unconsciously been sending signals for me to back off, and I just
      take it as business as usual. When I open the door to the roof, we find
      that we’re all alone. It seems that we’re the only ones that want to eat
      lunch under the cold late-January sky. “Man, it’s cold,” I say. “Wanna go
      somewhere else?” “I’m alright. If you want to eat somewhere else, however,
      then you are welcome to do so.” As always, her sarcasm-drenched politeness
      doesn’t really bother me. We sit beside the wall to avoid the chill of the
      wind, with me already having finished two sandwiches. hasn’t even touched
      hers. “Why are you even talking to me?” murmured something almost
      inaudible even in this deserted rooftop, and it was so sudden I wasn’t
      able to hear it clearly. “You said something, ?” “I said, why are you so
      thoughtless?” she says while fixing me with the same angry glare she had
      on earlier. “Oh, come on. I’ve been called ‘honest to a fault’ many times
      before, but never ‘thoughtless.’” “Then everyone’s been going easy on
      you,” she says, sounding con- vinced. finally breaks open the wrapping on
      her egg sandwich; the sound of the crunching plastic seal echoed in the
      empty rooftop. The noise was fitting somehow. sits silently now while
      eating her sandwich in small, deliberate chunks, and as I’m already done,
      I’m just sort of idling. I can practically feel the wave of angered
      expectation she’s generating, so I try to break it by starting the
      conversation that had been in the air since I asked her to eat lunch with
      me. “, I’m sure you’re a little mad at me…” “A little?!” Her eyes stare
      needle point daggers at me. It’s what I get for just saying what comes to
      mind, but this subject needed to be broached sooner or later anyway. “God,
      you’re annoying,” sighs. “I have no idea why you still choose to associate
      yourself with me after all that I’ve shown you and all that Shiki said to
      you yesterday.” “I don’t know why either,” I shrug lightly. “Being with
      you is kinda fun, but if you asked me why, I wouldn’t know what to say.”
      “Kokutō, you do understand that I’m abnormal, right?” There’s nothing I
      can do but nod. Her split personality (or whatever it is) obviously makes
      her some variety of odd. “Of course I do.” “Then why aren’t you getting
      it? I’m not someone you can just walk up to everyday and expect to hang
      out normally with.” “Does it really matter if you’re normal or not?” That
      statement made for ’ second surprised face of the day. She looks at me
      straight and unmoving, so much that I thought that she might have even
      stopped breathing. “But…I can’t be anything like you,” says. She brushes a
      hand on her hair, making the sleeve of her kimono slide down to reveal a
      bandage wrapped around her slender right arm, just around the elbow. It
      looks like it’s only been recently applied. “, that wound-“ Abruptly,
      stands up before I can finish my sentence. She avoids looking at me,
      deliberately staring at some far off place. “If Shiki’s words aren’t
      getting through to you, then allow me to eluci- date on them,” she says.
      “If this goes on, I will kill you.” Now it was my turn to be surprised. I
      could muster no reply. Without even throwing away the plastic wrapping of
      her egg sandwich, leaves the roof and returns to the classroom. Left
      alone, I clean up the trash we both left behind. “Now I’ve really done it.
      It’s just like Gakuto said.” It was all I could end up saying to myself.
      Because just like Gakuto said, I might really be an idiot. I couldn’t
      bring myself to hate , even after what she said. In fact, I think my mind
      just cleared up on the matter. At this point, there’s only one reason why
      I like being with . “I’ve become crazy a long time ago.” If only I had
      realized it sooner. If only I had realized that I like Ryōgi so much, that
      I can laugh at being told about my eventual murder.
