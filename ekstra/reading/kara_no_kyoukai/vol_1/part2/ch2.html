    <p>
      On the day the finals for the second quarter ended, I saw a very unusual
      thing. Inside my desk was a letter, which automatically makes it a bit
      weird, but it didn’t end there. It was the content of the letter and its
      sender that surprised me. It was brazenly asking me out on a date. The
      letter said something simple like “take me out on a date, will ya?”, but
      something about it was vaguely threatening, almost like an ultimatum. I
      came home that day, not knowing what to make of what I just read. I waited
      for the next day to come, with all the dread of a samurai who had just
      been ordered to commit seppuku the first thing in the morning. I’ve been
      waiting for what must have been an hour in the place designated: the
      statue of the dog Hachikō in front of the train station, when I finally
      see her walking towards me from quite a bit away. The first thing I notice
      is that she’s wearing a different colored kimono today, the color of
      autumn leaves. It actually goes well with her bright red jacket. Though I
      see almost every day, I’ve never really noticed how small she is, looking
      at her from this distance. The walk that animates her makes her features
      look distant and cold, and yet she carries herself with dignity and grace;
      a contradiction not unlike the one you would find on a puppet, a puppet
      almost alive in its appearance, and yet ultimately dead. “Yo, Kokutō. Been
      waiting long? My bad, man. Losing Akitaka was a pain in the ass.” The
      second thing I notice is that she pronounces my name weird, and I get the
      feeling she’s referencing some long-dead French poet with it. And that’s
      not even going into the way she’s talking now. It leaves me stunned for a
      second, and I look at her a bit too long, as if to confirm whether it
      really is or some sort of elaborate but dumb prank by Gakuto. “What, being
      an hour late is a cardinal sin now?” says. She must have noticed my mouth
      now hanging half-open. “Unclenching your ass some would do you wonders, my
      friend.” ’ black eyes stare at me weirdly. The same eyes that always
      looked like they were staring at something far off, even during the first
      time we met on that snowy day. “Um, I—I just wanna check,” I stutter,
      laughing in my head as I do so. “You’re , right?” She raises an eyebrow at
      me. “You were expecting maybe the school principal?” laughs, leaving a
      suspended grin on her face afterwards. “Well, time’s a-wastin’. I’m not
      good at this, so I’m gonna have to leave it to you where we go.” She then
      grabs my arm in a solid grip and starts to walk. Making a mockery of her
      final statement, she strings me along by the arm across a variety of
      specialty stores, never really buying anything, but moving on to a new
      shop after she gets bored. I try reasoning with her, see if she wanted to
      go to a movie or a coffee shop to take a breather, but she parries with an
      immediate and resounding “No.” She’s probably right, anyway. Going to such
      boring places wouldn’t fit ’ character now. She talked. A lot. Quite a
      contrast to the usually quiet I knew. It’s like she’s high or something.
      Most of the stores we visit are clothing stores. Given the state she’s in
      right now, it made me breathe a sigh of relief that she’s still going to
      women’s clothing stores. Finally, after four hours of keeping up with ,
      she says she wants to eat, and so after much wandering, she decides on a
      fast food store. The second we go inside the restaurant attracts attention
      with her ridiculously out of place kimono, but she doesn’t seem to mind.
      As she places her jacket on her seat and sits down, I decide to ask her
      the obvious. “So, is this the way you normally talk out of school, ?”
      “Only in my case,” she says in between furious chewing of hamburger
      chunks. It looks like she doesn’t like it. “But really, how you talk means
      absolutely nothing. I mean, you could change how you talk right now and
      you’d still be the same guy, right?” finishes the hamburger in seconds.
      “I’m sure I’ve got you absolutely confused right about now.” She has no
      idea. “I guess I have some explaining to do. This is the first time you’ve
      seen me after all. I’ve been quiet until now because me and were on the
      same wavelength on this one.” The words are going in, but I don’t
      understand what she’s saying at all. “It’s what you would call a split
      personality. I’m Shiki, and the one you usually see is . But don’t get me
      wrong, we’re not like different people or anything. Ryōgi has always been
      one person. The only difference between us is our priorities.” While she
      says this, she puts a wet finger to a paper napkin, writing her two names,
      with two differing characters but the same pronunciation. One Shiki that
      means “weave”. Another that means “ritual”. “I just wanted to give you a
      friendly neighborhood chat, is all. wasn’t keen on the idea, so I took
      over in her place. You get me?” “I…suppose so,” I answer uneasily. The
      truth is that I really do sort of get it, when I think about the time we
      met at the school orientation. We’d met before that, but when we talked at
      the orientation, she said she didn’t know anything about it. I thought it
      was because she hated me or some other similar reason, but I guess now I
      can kind of understand. Being with her for half the day, I come to
      understand there really isn’t so big a difference between today’s Shiki
      and the I supposedly know. Like she says, she talks differently, but the
      way she moves is the same. So much the same, in fact, that doubting the
      veracity of what she says seems now a foolish notion. “But why tell me?” I
      say. “Figured it’s only a matter of time before you knew.” She takes a sip
      from her juice but immediately puts it down. She doesn’t really like cold
      things. “I’m what you would call ’ destructive impulse. I represent the
      things she wants to do the most. But until now there’s no one I could
      direct this impulse at. had no real interest in anyone.” She mentions this
      with disinterest and just a tinge of regret, as if dreading the fact that
      she had to say it at all. She keeps looking at me seriously, and I’m
      afraid of what she’ll do should I move. “You can relax, man. I’m still
      myself, and I’m just being a mouthpiece for what thinks right now. I’m not
      gonna go Charles Whitman on you.” There is a pause for a moment, as her
      face grows more stern, as if to presage the saying of something important.
      “Though…we are beginning to be out of sync, so I’d take myself with just a
      little grain of salt, if I were you.” “’Out of sync?’ Does that mean you
      and got in a fight?” “I like how you think someone can have a fight with
      himself. But no, not like that. See, whatever I do, it has to be something
      we both want. ’ at the helm here, so meeting you was a mutual decision.
      She probably would have gone about it entirely different, though. It’s not
      really in her to just go out and take you on a date. You can thank me for
      that one.” I nod without really thinking, focusing more on what she’s
      saying, partly because it’s interesting, and partly because I can’t take
      in half of what she’s saying. Shiki laughs. “See, I like that about you.
      thinks otherwise. That’s what I mean when I say out of sync.” The way she
      worded it, I don’t know if doesn’t like that I don’t give it much thought,
      or if doesn’t like that Shiki likes me. I’d like to believe it’s the
      latter though, for the sake of my pride at the very least. Quite abruptly,
      Shiki stands up, and puts the money for the food she ate on the table.
      “Well, guess that’s about it. Let’s call it a day.” Putting her jacket on,
      she makes her way to the door with a happy skip in her walk, leaving with
      only one thing to say: “You’re all right, man. I like you, so we’ll see
      each other real soon.” After parting with Shiki, I start to make my way
      home. Once I reach the street, I’m surprised to see the city being bathed
      with the warm glow of sunset. Though it’s still a relatively early time,
      there’s a lot less people in the main road than usual thanks to the recent
      murders. I must be tired after talking (not to mention window shopping)
      with Shiki for that long, so I make my way inside my house with only a
      cursory greeting to my parents. I was planning to inhabit the kotatsu for
      a good warm nap, only to find my cousin Daisuke, a frequent visitor and a
      good friend, had already usurped the table. Wordlessly, we initiate a
      battle for the warm table, struggling with our legs to gain the most
      ground. In the end, however, I am no match for him, and while he lies
      down, half his body being warmed by the kotatsu, I end up having to stand
      up. “You must be busy these days, Daisuke,” I say while eating some of the
      oranges on top of the table, resignation clear in my voice. “Yeah, real
      busy, what with five murders in three months. Sorry for crashing in your
      house like this. Figured your dad’s house was closer to the police
      station, and I only get one hour of R&R before I need to get back, so
      going home would have been a waste of time.” My cousin Daisuke is a
      homicide detective in the city police, an irony since he’s “kind of a lazy
      guy.” His words, not mine. Why the department would put a man so unfit for
      the position of solving crime is a mystery not even he can solve. He’s my
      go-to source for all of the crime related stuff that happens, a
      convenience that seems to be proving its worth with every passing day.
      “How’s the search going?” I ask. “Baby steps. We were pretty hard up for
      leads, but in this fifth vic, the suspect finally threw us a bone, even if
      it does seem intentional.” Daisuke sits up and faces me, a grim look on
      his worn out and sleep-deprived face. “What I’m about to tell you is
      confidential, Mikiya. You’re not entirely unrelated to this, so listen up.
      I told you about the first vic, right?” Daisuke then proceeds to describe
      the situation with the second and third victims. While hoping that not all
      policemen in the country are this loose-tongued, I listen to his story.
      The second victim was vertically sliced in half from the crotch to the
      head. Murder weapon unknown. One of the halves was stuck to the wall. The
      third victim had his limbs cut off, and the arms sewn to the legs. The
      fourth was cut into pieces, with what looked like a symbol or some other
      marking left on the body. The fifth was arranged such that the arms and
      legs formed a manji symbol. “Obviously someone with some sort of mental
      disorder,” I say, trying to hold back the growing sickness in my stomach.
      “Too obvious, though. This guy has some sort of point to make here. What
      do you think?” “Hmm. I don’t think there’s any meaning in them all being
      killed by a cutting weapon. Other than that, I don’t know. But…” “But?”
      “He’s getting used to it. All the victims until now have been outside. The
      next one might be a break and enter job.” Daisuke puts a hand on his
      temple. I really do pity the stress this job, and heck, this case is
      giving him. I know he’s barely had any time to himself. “There’s no
      motive, no pattern,” he observes. “And he might try going inside houses
      next if he doesn’t find anyone outside to kill. I hope the brass gets the
      same read on this guy and have some sort of plan for it. Probably not,
      though.” He closes his eyes, right hand still resting on his head, nursing
      an invisible wound. “As for why I told you all of this…we found this in
      the fifth crime scene. Suspect probably dropped it.” He produces a small
      plastic bag from his pocket; the kind used to preserve evidence, and
      inside is our school emblem. We have to stick it somewhere in our clothes
      when we go to school. “The area had a lot of vegetation, so the suspect
      might not have noticed that he dropped this. Or it could have been
      intentional, some sort of message. I don’t know. But it’s the only lead I
      got. I might be paying your school a visit in a few days,” Daisuke says,
      almost like a premonition for an ill omen.
