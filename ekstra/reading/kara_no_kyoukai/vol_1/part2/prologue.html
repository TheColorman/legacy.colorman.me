    <h1 class="title">The First Homicide Inquiry - Prologue</h1>
    <p>
      April 1995. I met her. A cool breeze blows through the mansion, unexpected
      when it was just the end of summer. The wind carries tidings of autumn,
      and it makes me want to take an evening stroll again. I’m putting on my
      shoes, when a voice from behind me spoke. “Lady , please do come home
      early this evening.” It is Akitaka, my servant. I ignore the impositions
      on his ever-monotonous voice, as always, and make my way out of the
      entrance hall. Past the courtyard, past the garden, and past the large
      gate barring entry into the house, and I’m finally out. Darkness lay
      beyond this point, there being no light outside the main grounds itself.
      There is neither sight nor sound of any person except for me. It was
      midnight, and it would soon be the first day of September. The bamboo
      thickets surrounding the periphery of the mansion rustled in the light
      breeze, bringing to mind images of wicked monsters beyond them. Walks
      through uneasy silences such as these are the only thing I derive pleasure
      from. As the night grows deeper, the darkness draws closer. I think I walk
      through this lifeless town because I want to be alone. Or perhaps because
      I want to think I’m alone. Either way, in this world, it’d be hard to be
      completely left alone anyway. But the city has its ways. I veer off from
      the main avenue, taking a detour through a narrow alleyway. I turn sixteen
      this year. I’m a first year student at a private high school. It’s kind of
      pointless, really. No matter what I do, the mansion and the dynasty is my
      future. I chose the school just because it was close to my house and it
      would cut down on my commute time, but looking back on it, that might have
      been a mistake. The alley is dark, save for one streetlight flickering
      nervously like a beacon. It reminds me of someone. I’ve been quite
      restless lately, even during these evening strolls. It’s all because of
      that guy, who keeps popping up in my head whenever I least expect it, and
      whenever I least like it. Being in high school didn’t change anything. I
      couldn’t grow close to anyone, and they couldn’t grow close to me. I
      didn’t know why exactly, but maybe it’s because I easily express what I
      think in my behavior. That is to say, I’m a misanthrope. I couldn’t come
      to like people ever since I was a child. Being a person, I never liked
      myself either. I didn’t hate people, not really. It didn’t stop them from
      thinking that way, though. It wasn’t long before my schoolmates got the
      picture, and within a month, people stopped trying to ingratiate
      themselves with me. Not that I didn’t like a quiet environment either, so
      that state of affairs suited me perfectly. But I should have known better
      than to think it would last. There is the one classmate who treated me
      like a friend, a person with a surname that sounded like a French poet.
      The one outstanding quality I can attribute to him: annoying. So very,
      very annoying. I see the shadow of a person in the distant streetlight.
      Something about that man seemed strange. . I follow him into an alley.
      Inside the alley, it’s like an entirely different world. The alley is a
      cul-de-sac, with the buildings forming walls all around it. Because of
      this, no sunlight shone upon it even on bright afternoons. Honestly, it
      looked more like a room than an alley. There was once one homeless person
      who lived in this dead space, but not today. The walls of this alley just
      got a brand new paint job. There is a wet, sticky quality to the ground,
      and the usual smell of rotten food is commingled with an even stronger
      scent. All around me is a sea of blood. Bodily fluids seep and flow
      through the alley, and the sweet, sticky smell pierces my nostrils. In the
      center of it all is the corpse. Whatever face he donned in death can’t be
      seen anymore. His arms were severed, and the legs became stumps around the
      knee area, pressurized blood pouring out of them. A world so different,
      even the darkness of night was being overwhelmed by the bold crimson of
      blood. It made me so happy. Gracefully, elegantly, I touch the blood
      running on the ground, the sleeves of my light blue kimono turning a deep
      red. I streak the liquid on my lips, and a drop slips down lazily across
      my face. My body shakes in utter ecstasy, as if in a trance. The first
      lipstick I ever had. As summer vacation draws to a close, a new semester
      of high school begins. Nothing really changes in life, least of all high
      school. The clothes of the students change to reflect the approaching cold
      of autumn, but apart from that small trifling thing, there is nothing
      else. The same old routine, day in and day out. As for me, I’ve never worn
      anything other than a kimono my entire life. Akitaka tried to get me
      clothes “befitting a woman of my sixteen years”, but I never even thought
      of putting them on. Lucky for me, then, that the school I go to allows you
      to wear anything you want, so I actually went to school in my traditional
      dress. Actually, I wanted to wear the formal style of kimono, but if I did
      that, I’d have to spend the entirety of P.E. just to change clothes (which
      may not be so bad), so I made a compromise with a one-layer yukata. I did
      worry a bit about what to wear in the cold winter months, but a solution
      presented itself yesterday. During break time he approached me in his
      usual crude manner, asking if I felt cold. “Not right now, no,” I replied.
      “But perhaps in a few more weeks.” He frowned, as if reading my mind.
      “You’re wearing that in the winter too?” Wanting the conversation to end
      as quickly as possible, I answered directly. “Without fail. There’s no
      need to worry yourself, however. I can wear something over it, after all.”
      “Wow, I didn’t figure there was anything you could possibly wear over a
      kimono.” With that, he walked away, puzzled at my answer. It was something
      I thought up at the moment, but not wanting to lie, I decided to buy a
      warm leather jacket. I’ll wear it when winter comes, but for now, it stays
      in my closet. And just like that, we ended up eating lunch together every
      day. He invited me, and I couldn’t refuse out of politeness. We had our
      meals at the roof of the school building, where there were pairs of boys
      and girls just like us idling their lunch time. Today’s lunch break is
      just like any other, and I’m eyeing the other couples when he suddenly
      talks to me. I had already planned to ignore him, but he says something
      that I couldn’t ignore. “Murder. It happened on the last day of summer
      vacation. It was on the western wing of the commercial district. There’s
      an embargo on the media, though, so it hasn’t been reported yet.” “…That
      isn’t very nice, is it?” I say nervously. “Yeah. It’s a weird case, too.
      Apparently the suspect cut off the victim’s hands and feet and left him
      there to die. The crime scene was a mess, and they had to cordon off the
      entire location. What’s worse is that the suspect is still at large.” “You
      say the suspect cut off the arms and legs? Can people die from just that?”
      “Blood loss would cause a lack of oxygen in the body, but in this case I’d
      say circulatory shock came first,” he says while chewing his food.
      Outwardly, he looks like a calm, innocent young man, but in the end I
      suppose these are the sorts of things he really wants to talk about. I
      suppose one of his relatives is in the police force, or at least has
      connections there. Surely not too high a standing, however, else he
      wouldn’t be leaking information out like this. “Oh, I’m sorry. I guess
      this has nothing to do with you, .” “It’s quite alright…but Kokutō, this
      isn’t really a meal time topic, don’t you think?” I complain. He offers
      only a simple nod in reply, barely even registering his faux pas. Good
      grief. Now, thanks to him, I can’t stomach eating the tomato sandwich I
      just bought. And so I capped of the end of summer and welcome the coming
      of autumn by hearing such a morbid rumor. The life that I thought would
      never change would soon receive a rude awakening. It’s been raining hard
      since morning. The clacking of my footsteps on the school corridor mixed
      with the pitter-patter sound of the raindrops. School has concluded for
      the day, and not a single soul could be found inside the grounds at this
      hour. Normally, there would still be students doing club activities, but
      the murder incident that Kokutō told me about had finally gone public, and
      club activities have since been temporarily suspended. Akitaka told me in
      the drive to school earlier this morning that it had already reached four
      murders this month alone. That’s what blew this wide open. The suspect
      remained as yet free from the law, and whatever personality, character, or
      motive he might have for doing this isn’t yet known. In fact, marking the
      suspect as male might even be too hasty right now. There are no common
      points connecting the victims, except for the fact that they were all
      taking a walk quite late in the evening. It really is quite a different
      story when it’s happening to your own city instead of some remote and far
      away town. Students stop hanging out after school and go home immediately,
      and everyone goes home in groups. The vise grip the murderer has on the
      city is so tangible I can almost touch it. Even I’m affected, since the
      police go on patrols at 9 o’ clock in the evening. I can’t even go out to
      do my nightly strolls. “Four murders…” I whisper under my breath. Four
      times, I’ve… “Ryōgi?” someone calls out suddenly. I turn towards the
      direction of the voice and see a man I don’t recognize. He’s wearing blue
      jeans and a white shirt, both of them quite plain and unsatisfactory. He
      must be someone in a higher grade level than me. “Yes, that would be me.
      What is it?” “Oh, please don’t glare at me with those cold eyes of yours.
      Are you looking for Kokutō?” What a foolish man. I could see right through
      his fake smile. “I was about to go home. I have no idea how Kokutō factors
      into that.” “Is that so?” The drawl in his voice was practically audible
      at this point. “That’s where you’re wrong, and you know it. That’s why
      you’re irritated. It isn’t good to take it out on someone else. It can be
      easier to blame anyone other than yourself. It’s become a habit for you,
      hasn’t it?” He chuckles at a joke funny only to himself, but continues.
      “Ryōgi… don’t you think four times is a bit too much?” “What?!”
      Inadvertently, I take a step back. The man smiles yet again, a satisfied
      smile I now realize looks similar to my own. “I’ve wanted to talk to you
      for so long now. Now that I have, it’s time to bid you farewell.” After
      that, he walks away, the sound of his footsteps echoing in the dim, empty
      hall. It produced a vaguely disgusted feeling inside me. I don’t even want
      look at him, so I head towards the school entrance. After changing out of
      my school shoes, I head outside only to have the rain greet me. Akitaka,
      who was supposed to pick me up, evidently isn’t here yet. On rainy days
      such as this one, he would always come by to give me a ride, but he is
      obviously late. I’m too lazy to bother changing shoes again, so I decide
      to take shelter from the rain in the shade of the entryway. The rain looks
      faintly like a veil, and it makes the campus grounds look as if they were
      encased by fog. The winter chill makes the pale whiteness of my breath
      visible. I don’t know how much time passed by, but before I could notice,
      Kokutō had appeared at my side. “I have an umbrella,” he says awkwardly.
      “It’s alright. I have someone picking me up. You should hurry up and head
      home,” I urge. “In a moment. I thought I’d stay here until your driver got
      here. If that isn’t too much trouble?” Without waiting for me to answer,
      he leans against the concrete wall of the entrance. I wasn’t thinking on
      what Kokutō was going to say or about to say. In fact, I planned on
      systematically ignoring him until such time that I could leave. A miracle.
      He’s actually quiet for once. I can only hear the sound of the falling
      raindrops. Kokutō wasn’t talking at all. I turned to him only to see that,
      with a satisfied look on his face, he had already closed his eyes. I
      thought that he was sleeping, as unlikely as that may be, but I hear him
      singing under his breath. I know it was a famous song, but I couldn’t
      remember the title. Truly a miracle. Much later when I got home, I asked
      Akitaka what the song was, and it turned out to be “Singing in the Rain.”
      Kokutō didn’t speak. We weren’t even a meter apart. For us to be this
      close and not talking made me a bit unsettled. It was an awkward
      situation, but the silence wasn’t at all painful. Strange. Why was this
      silence calming? But then the silence frightened me, as suddenly as I
      warmed to it. Instinct raced in my mind, telling me that if it stayed like
      this, he would come out. “KOKUTŌ!” “Yes?!” With a jump, he opens his eyes
      and stands straight. “What happened? Is something wrong?” he says while
      looking at me oddly. I see myself reflected in his eyes. Looking at each
      other like that, it was probably the first time I really saw Mikiya
      Kokutō, still just a boy, with a boy’s face, and a gentle disposition. He
      had black hair which he didn’t style in any particular way, and similarly
      black eyes, where he wore stupid glasses that even little children would
      find atrocious. He wore no accessories, and his only concession to fashion
      was his insistence on wearing an all-black ensemble all the time. It has
      always puzzled me why he always gave a mind to anything I did. “Where…” I
      look down, trying my damndest to think that the ground is the most
      interesting in the world. “Where were you before you came out here?” “In
      the student council room. One of our upperclassmen is dropping out of
      school, and we held something like a farewell party for him. His name’s
      Lio Shirazumi. He said he’s dropping out because he found something he
      wanted to do. It surprised me, seeing as he was one of those quiet,
      un-social types.” Lio Shirazumi. I can’t say I’ve heard of the person. But
      Kokutō knows a lot of people I don’t. The class sees him as a friend to
      everyone, and he has some small popularity with the female upperclassman
      population. “I invited you too, didn’t I? I told you when we said goodbye
      to each other yesterday, but you never showed up in the student council
      room. I looked for you in the classroom, but there was no one there.” He
      did indeed invite me, but I would’ve just spoiled the mood by going there.
      That, and I thought Kokutō inviting me was just him being his usual polite
      self. He didn’t really expect me to go…did he? “Oh, so you were serious?”
      “Of course I was! What did you think, ?” Kokutō, understandably, gets mad,
      not because of what I said but what I thought he said. I’ve never really
      experienced someone being angry at me, and it confuses me. From that
      moment on I sink into silence and wait with my mouth shut. I don’t think
      there’s ever been a day that I wanted Akitaka to come quickly as badly as
      this one. Not long thereafter, the car entered the front gate, and I say
      an awkward goodbye to Kokutō. When the sun began to set, and it grew
      darker and darker, the rain finally stopped. Putting on my red leather
      blouson, I head outside to clear my head. The night sky overhead is in
      turmoil. The clouds that blanketed the sky only occasionally gave way to
      the moon and the stars. In the city, policemen in uniform and plainclothes
      alike patrolled the streets, and I made my way to the riverbank in hopes
      of avoiding them. Wet asphalt reflects the dim glow of the streetlights.
      From afar, I hear the menacing metallic rumbling of a train. That means
      the train viaduct is near. Almost arbitrarily, I decide to head towards
      that direction, but I stop short upon reaching it when I see someone
      there. Slowly and purposefully, I approach. Another train passes overhead,
      probably tonight’s last ride. The noise is louder this time, since I’m
      closer, and it sounds like rolling thunder. The rumble reverberates as
      loudly as if I was in a sealed room, and I have to cover my ears if I
      don’t want to go deaf. After the train passes, however, a solemn sort of
      silence descends under the viaduct. Without streetlight or moonlight, this
      place is in complete darkness. That might be for the best. Red liquid is
      spread all around the riverbank, yet even this is almost black because of
      the lack of light. This would be the fifth. The weeds around here are
      overgrown, but the corpse it surrounds looks like a single solitary
      flower, red and artificial. The face is at the center, with dismembered
      arms and legs surrounding it, twisted to look like flower petals, or a
      manji cross. I’m starting to get used to this. I gulp, and I realize my
      throat is dry. Is it tension, or arousal, I wonder? My thirst burns my
      throat, but it doesn’t matter. This place is pregnant with death, and I
      smile wordlessly in spite of myself. The thirst turns into screaming
      ecstasy inside of me, the pleasure almost too overwhelming, but I manage
      to hold it back. I gaze upon the beautiful corpse once more, and feel for
      once that I am truly alive. At the beginning of each month, it is
      customary in the Ryōgi dynasty for the head of the family and the heir to
      have a sword duel with live steel. In the past, different swordmasters
      would be invited to participate in the duel, and to teach their craft. But
      then, tiring of such acts, one of my ancestors stopped this practice long
      ago, and created within the manor his own school of swordsmanship. Into
      such a tradition was I born, and even a girl of the Ryōgi dynasty must
      bear a certain standard with the sword. My father was a strong man, and
      skillful with his weapon. In our duel, he made the sword dance like no
      other, and easily overpowered me. It is this disparity in skill and
      strength that has just made me lose the duel. After this, I waste no time
      in returning to the main building of the manor, which lies a fair bit of
      distance away from the dōjo. The wooden floor of the compound is
      immaculately treated, and makes no sound as my feet tread upon it. On the
      way, I see Akitaka standing in a corridor waiting for me. Ten years my
      senior, Akitaka is the servant assigned to me by the household since my
      childhood days. He is a dutiful and patient man, especially with me. He’s
      probably waiting on me so he can change me out of my sweat-soaked clothes.
      “You fought a close duel today. How is your father?” “Goddamit, Akitaka,
      stop shadowing me all the time. I can at least change by myself. It’s not
      like we’re joined at the hip. You’d be better served sucking up to my
      brother, you know that? Males succeed the dynasty, after all.” Despite my
      rudeness, Akitaka smiles. “You are quite wrong, my lady. There is no
      successor to the dynasty but you, for you are the only one that inherited
      the gift.” The statement elicits a small chuckle from me. “A gift, is it?
      What I have, Akitaka, is a curse.” Leaving Akitaka in the corridor, I
      continue to head toward the main building. Once I reach my room, I
      instinctively lock the door shut and immediately undress my training
      garments. I steal a glance of myself in the mirror, at the body of a
      sixteen year old girl. Actually, I only need to put in a little effort to
      make my face look like a guy, but I can’t cheat that way with the rest of
      my body. The body that continues to grow, month after month, year after
      year…the body that Shiki detests more and more with each passing day. “It
      might have been better for me to be a guy,” I say to no one in particular.
      No one is listening, except for me. Except for him. The one inside me
      called Shiki. All descendants of our clan are given two different names,
      two different logograms, though with the same pronunciation. There is the
      masculine name, which belongs to yang, the positive. And then the feminine
      name, which belongs to yin, the negative. As I was born a girl, I am <em>Shiki</em>. Had
      I been a boy, I would have been named <strong>Shiki</strong>. The reason we undertake such
      a peculiar practice is simple to understand. The descendants of the Ryōgi
      dynasty have a high chance of inheriting dissociative identity disorder,
      what most people would know as a split personality…in other words, someone
      like me. My father once said that ours was a dynasty blessed, a state of
      grace that only few know. He also said it was a curse. He got the “curse”
      part right, at least. This isn’t a state of grace by any stretch of the
      imagination. It is, quite simply, an abnormality. Fortunately, I’m the
      first in a long time to successfully inherit the curse. Unfortunately,
      that only means that a lot of my relatives ended up in asylums before they
      were even old enough to understand what that meant. Having two
      personalities breaks most people eventually. The difference between dream
      and consciousness, the boundary between your memory and the other’s
      becomes blurred, and one so afflicted soon turns to suicide. But I was
      different. I didn’t become insane like the others…and so I was trained by
      the family. I like to think it’s because me and Shiki ignore each other.
      To me, Shiki is just another personality, one I switch to when I need it,
      and we exist simultaneously, aware of each other. In the duel between me
      and my father, I needed his aggressiveness, so I used him. But I am in
      control. Altogether, it’s a bit different from what people usually call a
      split personality. I am , but at the same time, I am also Shiki. Father
      was proud, proud to have actually spawned a proper heir to the dynasty in
      his generation. My older brother was cast aside in the line of succession,
      and I took his place. And really, I’m fine with that. I don’t bite the
      hand that feeds me. And I don’t mind living this poor excuse for a normal
      life. Not like I have any choice in the matter. Even if, say, Shiki turns
      into a cold-blooded killer, I can’t make him go away. There will always be
      something called “Shiki” inside of me, and in the end, both of us are the
      same. No more and no less.
