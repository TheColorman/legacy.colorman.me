    <h1 class="title">The First Homicide Inquiry - Epilogue</h1>
    <p>
      It’s July 1998, and I celebrate a little in my head as I finish up the
      day’s work early, just before lunch break. I say “work” but really, I’m
      just more of a secretary to Miss Tōko than anything, mostly doing the odd
      job she needs doing. I’m lucky to even get work at all, having dropped out
      of college halfway. “Kokutō, isn’t today your weekly visit?” “Yes, ma’am.
      Soon as I finish this up, I’m going there right away.” “Oh, don’t delay on
      account of me. You can go early. There’s nothing more for you to do here
      today, anyway.” I have to say, Miss Tōko’s temperament when her glasses
      are on is much more preferable. And after all, this is a good day for her
      too; since it’s the day she cleans that car she’s so proud of to an
      immaculate sparkle. She always likes doing that. “Thanks, ma’am. I’ll be
      back in about two hours.” “Bring me back a snack or two, all right?” She
      waves me a goodbye just before I close the door to her office. Ryōgi is
      still in the hospital, still in a coma unable to do anything. I still go
      to visit her every Saturday afternoon. She never told me about any pain
      she was holding in, or anything she thought about. I don’t even know why
      she tried to kill me. But at least she smiled in the end, even if it was a
      faint one. At least she smiled, and that was enough. Gakutō had it right a
      long time ago. I was already crazy. I guess that’s why I am the way I am
      today even after a brush with death. I still remember the last time we
      stood in the sunset lit classroom. Under that burning, blood red sky,
      asked me what part of her I believed in. And I still remember my answer.
      “I don’t have any basis, but I trust you. I like you, so I want to keep
      believing in you.” A premature answer, perhaps. I said I didn’t have any
      basis, but the truth is, I did. I just didn’t know it at the time. She
      didn’t kill anyone. That, at least, I could believe in. Because knew how
      painful murder was. She, above all others, knew the suffering that the
      victim and the murderer went through. That’s why I believed: in , who
      couldn’t express herself, in Shiki, who wasn’t given a chance to be a
      person, in , who was far from pain, and in Shiki, who knew nothing but
      pain. The three pieces now lie poised on the board. One a mind entwined
      with a specter floating, and on death, dependent. One a life in paradox
      eternal , and in death, pleasure. One a predator with origin awakened, and
      to death, gnosis. Three now swirl and dance, and in the spiral of conflict
      they wait.
