    <h1 class="title">The First Homicide Inquiry - V</h1>
    <p>
      I heard they found me lying on the ground near a puddle of my own vomit,
      awake but lying there dumbfounded. A patrolman spotted me and took me to a
      nearby station, where I was taken into questioning. Unfortunately, I was
      in a state of shock for about four hours, and they couldn’t get anything
      out of me. I guess my brain isn’t really prepared for that sort of thing.
      I don’t know if anybody is. The time it took from the interview to them
      releasing me made it so that I couldn’t make it to school anymore, so I
      decided to take a break today. While the corpse was spreading blood
      profusely all over the place, I was lucky enough to be far away and so
      didn’t have any blood spatter on me, so that (and the fact that I’m
      Daisuke’s cousin) sped up the processing quite a bit. Right now, Daisuke
      is giving me a ride back home. “So, you really didn’t see anyone, Mikiya?”
      “I said I didn’t. What’s it gonna take for you to believe me, huh?” I find
      myself surprised at the annoyed tone I take, but Daisuke just seems to
      take it in stride. “Alright, alright, I believe you. Fuck. I guess I
      should just be happy you’re alive; the killer wouldn’t have let you live
      if you’d seen anything. But goddamit. This case is still a
      stone-fucking-whodunit.” “It’s a career case if you solve it, though.” How
      sick am I, joking around with Daisuke like this? A voice in my head keeps
      whispering, liar, liar, and yet here I am lying with a straight face to a
      police detective who’d probably waste no second throwing me behind bars if
      he found out I was withholding information. Yet still, I didn’t say
      anything about being in the scene of the crime. “So, Mikiya, how was your
      first body?” “Well, spilled my guts out, didn’t I? I never want to see
      another one again if I can help it.” Daisuke gives a small chuckle and
      says “Yeah, I had that feeling too, first time around. Not every body that
      gets dumped in this city is like that, though, so you can rest easy.” Oh.
      Well, sure, Daisuke, I’ll rest easy on the fact that at least not all dead
      bodies you get are horribly mutilated. “But I didn’t know you were a
      friend of the Ryōgi girl, Mikiya. Small world.” The knowledge of me
      befriending Shiki makes him smile for some unknown reason, which makes me
      just a little bit more nervous. On record, they chalked this recent
      incident up to the same killer as all the others, and they took my
      statement that I was there on the night of February 3rd only after the
      murder had happened and the suspect had taken off. Both the Ryōgi family
      and myself have said nothing about , even though they must know that I
      know by now. “So did you investigate the family or something?” I ask
      Daisuke. “Hey, I wanted to, seeing as the daughter, , goes to your school,
      but they didn’t want to for some reason, and I can’t go knocking down
      their door when I don’t have a charge against them. Not that that makes
      them automatically suspicious or anything, but the only thing they said to
      me was ‘what happens outside of our grounds is none of our business.’
      Bunch of stuck up fools if you ask me.” Strange. This combined with the
      fact that they stopped the investigation just outside the grounds of the
      Ryōgi family and didn’t even try to ask going in makes me think the Ryōgis
      have some sort of suction on the force. “You ask me, though, I don’t
      really think they had anything to do with it,” Daisuke says suddenly.
      “Huh? Why?” Even though I make light of him most of the time, the truth
      is, I have faith in Daisuke’s detective skills. He’s cracked some tough
      nuts in the past, and it’s undoubtedly made him a valuable asset to the
      homicide division, despite his lack of reluctance in sharing police
      information with his all too curious cousin. I thought for sure he’d be at
      least a little suspicious about . “I just can’t see why any one of them
      would want to suddenly kill people. There’s no motive, at least not one I
      can see.” Then his eyes lose their look of contemplation, and he smiles at
      me. “Besides, you don’t see a girl like their daughter killing anybody,
      right? Too much of a looker for that to happen.” I sigh, and think
      fruitlessly at why such a carefree man is in such a grim occupation. “And
      that’s why you’ll be single for the rest of your life,” I reply. “Say any
      more and I’ll exercise my ability to lock you up for 24 hours without
      probable cause.” We don’t talk for the rest of the ride, but I do agree
      with Daisuke, even without his “amazing” powers of intuition. I mean,
      strictly speaking, I didn’t really see do anything, and I’m sticking to
      that one fact, even if she herself tells me otherwise. Now I have
      something I need to do. In retrospect, that was the last time for a long
      time that a murder like that happened. The elusive form and shape of the
      serial killer would not begin to become much clearer until three years
      later, and yet it all seems like a world apart to me now. But that was the
      first and last time that would ever face me with a look as frightening as
      she had that night. Just outside the grounds of our manor, in the stone
      path that led to the house, a murder took place. My stroll on that night
      was a scattered recollection of waking moments and seemingly blank
      unconsciousness, a trend that has started only recently, but connecting
      the moments I do remember seems to lead me to the obvious conclusion as to
      what I did. The disfigured corpse sprayed blood in every direction, and
      the very sight of the crimson liquid made my head spin and my knees weak.
      Shiki felt the same way, but I imagine for entirely different reasons.
      Worse, this person’s blood was especially beautiful. The way the blood
      seeped and flowed through the little spaces in between the stones of the
      path seemed to me to be the most elegant thing I’d ever seen in my life.
      Before long, I noticed that there was someone some distance behind me,
      retching at the spectacle before him, and when I turned my head to face
      him, it turned out to be Mikiya. I didn’t know the reason why he would be
      there at that late hour, and I didn’t even think about it at the time.
      After that, there was another spate of unconsciousness, but I think I
      remember returning to the mansion. I found out that the body was
      discovered much later, and strangely enough, there was no talk of me being
      there. Was the Mikiya I saw just a hallucination, some phantom dream
      designed by my mind? That man is too honest; there’s no way he would lie
      to the police to cover up the real killer. And why did it have to be done
      in front of my house? “Was it you, Shiki?” I ask out loud, but no answer
      came from within or without. The rift of disconnection between me and
      Shiki grew stronger with each passing day. Even if I hand him control of
      myself, we both have to want something to do it. But why is it that
      recently, when Shiki is in control, my memory becomes misty and
      indistinct? Maybe, just maybe, without me noticing, I’ve become just as
      insane as the other members of the Ryōgi dynasty. Jesus Christ, will you
      stop worrying? Here’s the thing: if you even so much as think you’re
      insane, it means you’re not. His voice comes to fore and berates me, but
      he’s right. Well, at least I’d like to think he’s right. Someone insane
      doesn’t question his own sanity. That at least gives me some comfort. A
      knock comes from the door of my room, and the voice of Akitaka comes right
      after, interrupting my thoughts. “My lady, may I intrude for a moment?” I
      invite him inside my room, but he refuses due to the late hour. “Is there
      something the matter?” I ask. “There seems to be someone keeping watch
      over the house.” “But I heard that Father managed to drive all the
      policemen away.” Akitaka nods. “The police withdrew from further
      investigation of the premises since last night. This one is an entirely
      different matter, however.” “You may do as you please. I don’t care who it
      is, he or she has nothing to do with me.” “But my lady, the one who is
      keeping watch seems to be your friend from school.” Upon hearing that, I
      stand up from the bed and immediately make my way to the window in my
      room, with its clear overlooking view of the mansion gate. I pull back the
      curtain and look outside, keeping my eyes trained beyond the walls. Sure
      enough, there he was, a solitary figure silhouetted in between the trees.
      I don’t know whether to laugh or be disappointed at his laughable attempt
      at concealing himself. “Only say the word and I will ask him to leave,”
      says Akitaka. “No, not tonight, I think. Leave him and do him no harm. He
      isn’t causing any trouble.” I skip lightly across the floor back to my bed
      and lie down. Akitaka says a final formal “goodnight”, turns off the
      lights, and closes the door. The next few minutes consist of me attempting
      and failing to fall asleep, as my mind keeps drifting back to the window
      and outside. With nothing to do, I give up and approach the window again,
      making sure he’s still there. And sure enough, he is. Despite his brown
      duffle coat, Mikiya is visibly shivering from the cold air. White puffs of
      air emanate from his mouth with every breath as he keeps watch on the gate
      with only a thermos of coffee by his feet to keep him company. Now there’s
      really no way that the Mikiya I saw in my fragmented memory was a dream. I
      can guess what he’s here for: to see if I’m really the killer. This could
      even be just a foolish attempt by him to keep the killer from ever doing
      it again; some sense of responsibility on his part as a witness. Watching
      him from this window while thinking, I bite a fingernail, as I am wont to
      do when angry. I guess there’s nothing else to do but force myself to
      sleep. I had already expected a less than customary greeting from Mikiya
      at school today, if any at all, so him saying… “, wanna eat lunch
      together?” …like nothing had happened is more than a little suspect. And
      as always, I go along with him. I feel like a pet being bribed to go the
      roof with food. I had already decided beforehand that I would try not to
      associate myself with him anymore, but I would be lying if I said that I
      didn’t want to know what he himself thought about that night. I took his
      offer for lunch thinking he would be the one asking me the obvious
      question, but he’s just thoroughly ignoring the elephant in the room with
      this one. “Does your house really need to be that big? Last time I went
      there, you even had a butler of some sort.” “Akitaka is more like my
      father’s private secretary. And I like to call him a caretaker rather than
      a servant, Kokutō.” “So I guess there really are people like that, huh?”
      he says, bookending his sentence with a nervous laugh. His voice exhibits
      a noticeable quiver. I can’t judge by his attitude whether or not he knows
      that we’ve realized he’s spying on the house, but still, even given the
      circumstances he’s acting too strange. There’s no way he couldn’t have
      seen me covered in blood given how close he was standing to the entire
      thing, but why is he still laughing and talking to me as if it was some
      big joke? Well, if he’s not talking about it, then it’s going to have to
      come from me. “Kokutō, on the night of February 3rd, you were—“ “Can we
      not talk about it?” And just like that, he sweeps the question away. “What
      exactly is it that we can’t talk about, Kokutō?” Unbelievable. The slight
      shift in tone, the vocal mannerism, the slightly off-beat way I just
      pronounced his surname. For a second there, Shiki owned my voice. Even
      Mikiya noticed; it’s all right there on his face. Strange. That’s never
      happened before, and it stuns me momentarily. I take a half-second of time
      to compose myself, clear my throat, and continue. “Be frank with me. Why
      did you not tell anything to the authorities?” “Because,” Mikiya answers,
      “I didn’t see anything.” You liar. That can’t be true. — that can’t be
      true because that night, Shiki approached you — “You just happened to be
      there,” he continues. “That’s the only thing I saw at the very least. So I
      decided to believe you.” You liar. If you believed me, why did you keep
      watch outside my house? — Shiki drew closer, rain-speckled and
      blood-spattered — “Honestly, it’s hard for me to talk about right now.
      Once I have more confidence in myself and put it behind me, maybe I can
      hear what you have to say. But for now, just…please, let’s not talk about
      it.” How I so wanted to look away from him, to run away from the honesty
      in his face. To me, it looked like it was accusing me of murder. — Shiki
      stood over him, and there was no mistaking it. He wanted to kill Mikiya.
      Even though I never wanted to kill him. He said he believed in me. If I
      could only throw away that impulse, if only I believed in myself, then
      maybe I could have been spared the taste of this strange new sadness. I
      did my damndest to avoid Mikiya after that day. After two days, he gave up
      on talking to me too, but he still sits outside the walls of the mansion
      every night without fail, for close to two weeks now. I admire his
      persistence, if nothing else. Under the chill of winter, Mikiya sits just
      a little inside the bamboo tree line outside of the grounds, watching the
      gate, and he does this until three o’ clock in the morning. Every night I
      spy a look at him, and every night I bite a nail in annoyance. I guess he
      got his wish; because of him, I haven’t been going out of the house at
      night lately. At three o’ clock in the morning, he always leaves not with
      a tired or worn out face, but with a smile. He isn’t doing this to find
      out who the killer is. He said he trusted me, as if it was entirely
      natural to do so. He’s doing this to prove, or otherwise convince himself,
      that I am innocent. That’s why, when the dawn breaks, and he starts to
      leave, he smiles. Because nothing happened. “I guess optimism is in his
      blood,” I murmured quietly, one night while watching him. And it makes me
      think. Being with Mikiya makes me calmer, more at peace. Being with Mikiya
      fools me into thinking I’m one of his kind. Being with Mikiya makes me
      think I can actually go to his side of the world, a bright side of the
      world that I’ll never be allowed into, a world that has no place for me.
      And with that dumb smile on his face, he tries to drag me in. That’s the
      real reason why I’m irritated at him. I’ve nursed a murderer inside me
      named Shiki for as long as I’ve lived, but Mikiya keeps showing me a
      better life, without Shiki, without the impulse of killing. But instead of
      making me happy, it just strengthens what I already know: that I am not
      normal, I don’t belong.“’, but now you’re proving to be a nuisance,
      Kokutō,” I murmur out loud. ’ I don’t want to break. If he hadn’t given me
      the dream, that small spark of hope of a normal life, everything would
      have turned out better for me. March has just begun, and already the cold
      seems to be receding. After class, I stay in the classroom and look
      outside the window. It feels like forever since I last did so. Here, in
      this window, the world that I view from on high actually makes me feel
      secure. A view of a world that I can’t reach doesn’t make me entertain any
      illusions of reaching it. And like a vision from older, better times,
      Mikiya enters the sunset bathed classroom in exactly the manner he used to
      do. Shiki always liked to talk to him like this. I did as well. “I never
      thought I’d get invited by you again to talk after class,” Mikiya says.
      “Are you going to stop ignoring me now?” “It’s because I realized I can’t
      go on doing that that I called you.” His eyes twitch a moment in surprise.
      Even though Shiki is trying his best to overcome me and take over, I try
      to hold out long enough to say what I have to say to Mikiya. “You said
      before that I’m not a murderer.” I can barely see Mikiya’s face against
      the bright red glow of the sunset, but I can see he’s disappointed that we
      had to talk about this. “Too bad. I am a murderer. You were at the scene
      of the crime, but why didn’t you tell anything to the police?” “Because
      there’s nothing for me to tell. You didn’t do anything, right?” “Even if
      I’m saying it to your face right now?” He nods. “Hey, you’re the one that
      said that I should take everything you say with a grain of salt. There’s
      no way you were the one that did that. I’m sure of it.” “What are you so
      sure of? What do you even know about me? What part of me can you believe
      in?” Unintentionally, my anger at him grows. For his part, he gives me a
      half-baked smile. “I don’t have any basis, but I trust you. See, I like
      you, so I want to keep on believing in you.” And that makes me stop like
      I’d just run into a wall. Those words which are probably just nothing to
      him are the most that anyone has given me; happiness, and my destruction,
      in one sentence. This carefree man has given me the illusion of a time
      spent with someone, a better world that’s not for me. Because I know that
      if I ever get close to someone, Shiki will come out and kill him, because
      denial is the sole reason he exists. And because he cannot live without
      affirmation, I exist. But because I’ve never been close to anything in my
      entire life, I could live through the paradox. Now that I know the world
      he can give me, the more I wish for it, the more I realize that it’s a
      hopeless and impossible wish. It hurts me and I hate it, and for the first
      time ever, I hate Mikiya from the bottom of my heart for making me realize
      it. And he laughs like it means nothing. I can’t stand being here anymore.
      I can’t stand him. I see it now. This is how Mikiya will destroy me. “You
      are a fool,” I declare. “Yeah, I get that a lot.” As the sunset slowly
      turns to dusk, I exit the classroom while I still can. Before I cross the
      doorway however, I do one last thing. With my back still turned, I ask
      Mikiya a question. “Are you coming tonight?” “What?” He sounds surprised.
      I guess he still doesn’t realize I watch his little vigils. He tries to
      wave it off, but I insist. “Answer me, damn you.” “I don’t know what
      you’re talking about, but if I feel like going to your house, I will.” And
      with that I leave him in the classroom, and exit the school grounds. Gray
      clouds dot the red horizon, and the low rumble of thunder sounds off in
      the distance. I guess it’ll be a rainy night tonight.
