    <p>
      Only when the sun had finally retreated and it became dark, just as I was
      making my way to ’ house, did the rain finally start to pour. Nice of it
      to wait like that. It isn’t a torrential downfall, but it isn’t a light
      drizzle either. The small, pattering sounds of the raindrops on the stone
      path, and on the leaves, and on my umbrella made this a night full of
      noise. The rain water itself is still cold, a leftover of the winter that
      the coming of March had not yet completely erased. Together with the
      bamboo leaves and trees as my sole companions tonight, I keep my eyes
      trained on the mansion and the gate. My umbrella hand is turning red,
      growing numb from the cold. I sigh, a big long one. I can’t keep this
      thing up forever, obviously. First thing, it feels like I’m a stalker.
      Second thing, it’s doing a number on my ability to keep awake in class.
      I’m gonna give it another week, and then I’ll probably call it quits. It’d
      be nice if the killer was caught in that time, though. I should have
      thought it would be the rain that would make me give in. It kinda feels
      like the cold and the rain are double teaming me just to lay off the
      creepy stake outs. I sigh, another long one. It’s not the rain that has me
      depressed though, but today’s verbal sparring with . “What part of me can
      you believe in?” she said. If she thinks I don’t believe her, than what
      have I actually been trying to do all this time? Anyone could tell from
      her face this afternoon that she was agonizing over something. She even
      looked like she was ready to cry; that, or tell you off. You never can
      tell with her. The rain doesn’t look like it’ll end soon. The raindrops
      make ripples even on the little puddles of water. If you can learn to
      selectively ignore the noise the raindrops are making, I’m sure it might
      even be a peaceful, serene night. But to me it’s just noise. And yet, even
      in all that noise, a singular splash, a single footfall behind me
      reverberates across the bamboo brush. I turn around to see only a solitary
      figure in a red kimono. It was her. She’d been out in the rain for a long
      time, that much was obvious. She was drenched from top to bottom, her
      short, black hair sticking to her cheeks and face, casting a dark shadow
      over her eyes. “.” I make my way to her. She must have been out here since
      the rain started. Her red kimono is so damp it’s sticking to her body, and
      her skin is so cold to the touch. I hold out my umbrella to cover the both
      of us while I rifle through my bag, searching for a towel. “Here, wipe
      yourself with this.” I extend my arm, towel draped over my hand. “What the
      hell are you doing out here in the rain when your house is right there?”
      She takes one glance at my outstretched arm, and laughs a bitter, queer
      laugh. It is punctuated by a keening sound slicing through the empty night
      air. “Wh…” It happened faster than my eye could see. I feel something warm
      in my arm, and instinctively take a step back. The red warmth in my arm is
      flowing downwards like a snake, splitting in two and dripping. My arm? A
      cut? Why? The pain pierces me, courses through my arm, hurting like
      nothing I’ve ever felt before. It makes me numb. No time to think. No time
      to even panic. She takes a step forward, I take a step back. Calmly. Have
      to run. Have to get away. No. No time to get away. I move fast, but she is
      faster, like a monster. Another keening sound, this time in my leg. Red.
      Red mixes with the puddles in the path. My red blood, rippling outwards
      from the impact of raindrops. I see it, see the cut on my leg, feel the
      pain. I collapse, face-up, seeing the sky, the falling rain. My back hits
      the stone path. I gasp at the sudden impact. She climbs on top of me, and
      points her knife at my throat. Calm. No time for panic. The noise of the
      rainfall retreats, ignored. Just calm. I look up, and see the darkness of
      the sky, and her, set against that darkness. Her eyes are black and
      implacable, like an abyss, and I see myself reflected in that void. I can
      feel the tip of the knife, just below my chin, steel cold to the touch
      like her skin. Like the blood on my leg, little water drops snake down her
      face, a face framed by her black hair; like a mask, it is blank,
      terrifying, and pitiful all at the same time. “Kokutō, ,” says. My last
      words. She wants to hear them. I look her straight in the eye, and speak
      with a wavering voice, desperately trying to keep calm. “I…don’t want…to
      die.” Somehow, I felt I wasn’t saying this to , but to the death that was
      now coming for me. She smiles. “I…I want to kill you.” It was a very
      gentle smile.
