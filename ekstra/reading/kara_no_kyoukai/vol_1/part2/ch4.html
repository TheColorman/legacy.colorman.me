    <p>
      I wake up to a perfectly good Sunday morning, the first Sunday of February
      in fact. After washing my face and brushing my teeth, I head to the dining
      room, and am surprised to find Daisuke there, waiting for me. “Why are you
      here?” I ask, in the manner of my usual morning crankiness. “Well, good
      morning to you, too. I missed the last train, so I came over for a while.
      I gotta go to work in a while, though. Savor school life while you’ve got
      it, Mikiya. When you grow up, working harder just translates to less
      vacations.” A yawn punctuates the last word in his sentence. His drooping
      shoulders and tired voice tell me just how much sleep he’s been getting.
      That only means two things: the investigation on the serial killer has
      either ground to a solid halt or they’ve gotten a new lead. “Oh yeah, you
      were talking about coming to my school last time we talked. Did anything
      come of that?” “Nothing, really. Lots of people lose school emblems, after
      all, and testing it turned up nothing on the offender database. But it
      might be back to your school for me.” He sighs, rubbing his eyes. “Truth
      is, a sixth body turned up three days ago. Signs of a struggle this time,
      which was different. The victim had long nails, and she probably clawed at
      her killer. Found about three centimeters of skin beneath the vic’s
      nails.” Now this was surprising. I haven’t even heard about this on the TV
      or the papers. Yet, even in the face of such grim news, my mind couldn’t
      help but drift off to and the conversation we had recently. She’d been
      talking about murder as well. A picture forms in my mind, of standing atop
      a bloody corpse, holding a knife… “So that means the killer was wounded?”
      I blurt out. “Um, yeah? Unless the victim was scratching her own damn
      self. Lab team thinks the skin is from the elbow, so I’d expect the
      killer’s nursing some pretty deep wounds thereabouts. The blood is being
      analyzed, and if it gets a match on the database, it’s checkmate.” Daisuke
      stands up after that, says a quick goodbye, and leaves. I suddenly find
      myself without the power to stand up, and I collapse on one of the chairs.
      It was only three days ago when I talked with Shiki in the sunset-lit
      classroom, and the day after that, I could’ve sworn there was a fresh
      bandage on her elbow. Past noon, I make up my mind. Just thinking and
      worrying about it isn’t going to do any good, so I figure if I ask
      herself, and she tells me she has nothing to do with the killings, then
      that’ll be enough. At the very least, it’ll do something to calm my
      nerves. I rifle through my school’s student registry book, and find ’ name
      and home address a few moments later. Her house is on the outskirts of
      town, and when I finally find it, the better part of the night had caught
      up with me. The Ryōgi estate’s periphery is populated by bamboo trees in
      every direction, a veritable forest, and the estate itself is built like
      an old 18th century mansion. The walls surrounding the grounds went on for
      so long, I don’t think I could have guessed the size of the place just by
      walking. I would’ve needed an airplane to get a better picture. A path
      leads me through the bamboo forest to a large gate. The entire thing looks
      like a relic left over from the Edo era, but despite this, I find an
      intercom beside the gate, a little anachronistic quality that gives me
      some small relief. I push the button and state my business, and in under a
      minute, a black-suited man opens the gates and comes out to greet me. He
      looks like he’s in his early thirties, and seems about as high-spirited as
      a ghost would be. “Welcome, young man.” he says with impeccably practiced
      politeness. “My name is Akitaka, a servant of the Ryōgi household and of
      the lady . Unfortunately, the lady is absent now and cannot meet you. If
      you would like, you may enter the mansion and await her return.” “Er…no,
      thanks. I think I’ll just come back another time.” Truth is, I don’t think
      I have the courage to go inside the mansion alone. “As you wish. Goodbye,
      then.” He goes inside the gates again, and it closes behind him with a
      sound of finality. Because it’s already dark, I decide to go home for
      today. I keep thinking about , and what she could be doing at such a late
      hour. I decide not to assume the worst. It’s the easiest way to a slippery
      slope of crippling anxiety. The walk to the station takes me an hour, but
      right at the station entrance I meet my former upperclassman. He invites
      me to dinner in a restaurant, and, not being one to refuse, I go with him.
      We end up talking until the hour hand of my watch is pointed at ten o’
      clock. Unlike my friend, I’m still a student, so I needed to get going
      soon. After saying goodbye to him, I buy a ticket for the train inside the
      station. The hour hand of my watch is creeping closer and closer to 11,
      but before I put the ticket on the turnstile, I allow myself to wonder,
      for a moment, if was home already. “God, what the hell am I doing here?” I
      say to myself, while walking through the unfamiliar residential
      neighborhood. The streets are empty with no signs of life, unsurprising
      given the hour and the circumstances, but I tried to pay it no heed; ’
      house was nearby. I know I won’t be able to meet her now even if I went
      there. But still, I just want to see the lights on in her house, in her
      room, just to know that she’s there, so I’m taking this short side trip
      back to the Ryōgi estate. The freezing winter air puts a strain on my
      shoulder muscles, and my ragged breath is keenly audible in the still
      night. Soon, the residential district is behind me and I face the tree
      line of the bamboo forest surrounding the Ryōgi estate for the second time
      tonight. The trees part for the little path that goes towards the front
      gate. No wind sings through the trees at this hour, and no light but the
      moon’s illuminates the path; far from making the forest less menacing, the
      silence only serves to accentuate my anxiety. I wonder what would happen
      if I got attacked here. As soon as the thought enters my mind, I regret it
      immediately. Though I was only half-joking with myself, my brain is now
      working overtime to exaggerate the fleeting image, even as I try to put it
      out of my mind. When I was little, I was afraid of monsters. I mistook the
      silhouettes flitting to and fro in the midst of the bamboo trees for
      ghosts and other horrors. But now, I’m scared of other people, people who
      you imagine will just jump out from behind the brush and attack you. What
      age was I when I started to replace the ghosts with people? Every step I
      take worsens the thought in my head, and I keep remembering the terrible
      image I saw when Daisuke told me about the recent murder. And while I try
      to exorcise that disturbing thought, I come across something in the path
      that makes my feet stop of their own volition. A few meters ahead, a white
      shadow of a person was standing. Her kimono is so white it seemed as if to
      shine in the moonlight, but it is speckled and sullied with something, and
      it continues to spread over the kimono’s surface. Something in front of
      her is spraying red liquid in all directions. Venturing forward a few
      steps, it becomes clear that the woman is . As for the object which I
      first took for some sort of fountain? A corpse, its form too mangled and
      bloody to identify at first sight. Somehow, I’m neither shocked nor
      surprised. Perhaps it’s because the same terrible premonition lingered in
      my thoughts just moments before, and in an instant, it turned into
      reality. Now my mind is blank. The body is fresh, otherwise it wouldn’t
      bleed profusely like that. The fatal wound starts at the neck, and
      continues down at an angle towards the body in a single, clean cut, like
      some macabre stole. stares at the body, standing still like a statue. The
      rich, red color of the spraying blood is enough to make me faint, but the
      organs seeping forth from the gaping wound makes the body look less like a
      human and more like a twisted facsimile of one made by someone mad. It
      repels and disgusts me so much that it’s hard to look at. Yet only
      continues to stare, unperturbed and placid. Red butterflies take flight
      from the wound, and descend lightly on ’ face, and on her ghostly kimono.
      Her blood-soaked lips twist into a shape...is it of fear, or of pleasure?
      Is she or Shiki? I try to say something, but my voice stops, and I fall to
      the ground just because of the effort of trying to talk. I vomit, my
      stomach retching out all its contents, all the bile. I wish it retched out
      this memory as well, but no such luck. I vomit so hard I start to cry. But
      that doesn’t make me feel any more relieved. The overwhelming smell of the
      blood is so rich it drowns my brain. And finally, notices me. She turns
      her head to look at me, and I see now that the twist on her lips earlier
      was a smile, a kind of warm, motherly smile that is so at odds with the
      scene that it makes me shiver. I can feel my consciousness start to leave
      me as she walks closer to me. Before I faint, she utters something at me.
      “Do be careful, Kokutō. A terrible premonition echoes a terrible reality.”
      I guess I was too optimistic. I refused to even think about this outcome
      until I was face to face with it.
