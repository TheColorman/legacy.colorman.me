      “So it’s true then? You and the Ryōgi girl have hooked up?” I almost turn
      the coffee milk in my mouth into a projectile at what Gakuto just said. I
      go into a coughing fit after almost choking on the damn thing, but it does
      give me a scant few seconds to scan the classroom for anyone who heard
      that. Everyone seems to be busy minding their own lunchtime business.
      “What do you mean?” I finally manage to say after gulping down my drink.
      “Don’t be playin’ dumb with me.” Gakuto’s face looks like he wants to
      shift the blame away from himself. “It ain’t no secret that you’ve been
      eyeing Ryōgi. Matter of fact, judging from the reaction you just made,
      seems the only ones who ain’t wise to it are the both of you.” I can’t see
      myself so I can’t really say, but I think I might inadvertently be making
      the most disappointed frown I’ve ever made in my life. The increasingly
      frigid winds and rapidly decreasing temperature signal November and the
      advent of winter, meaning that it’s been seven months since I first met .
      The time and our tendency to hang out together must have given people the
      wrong impression. “I’m sorry to say that you have been misinformed,” I
      finally say. “We’re just friends, if you could even call it that.” “That a
      fact?” His continued disbelief exasperates me. That Gakuto’s parents stuck
      him with a name meaning “man of learning” is the textbook definition of
      irony. It goes against his thick-headedness and his entire tendency to
      gravitate towards sports and less towards academically inclined pursuits.
      His status as the pride of the jūdō team attested to that more than
      anything. Despite our seeming incompatibility, we’ve struck a friendship
      that started way back in grade school that somehow sticks to this day.
      “You’re on a first name basis, though,” he continues. “She don’t seem like
      the kind of broad to just let that go without a warning.” “ really hates
      being called by her last name, though. I called her ‘Ryōgi’ one time just
      to see what happened, and she gave me a look as if I just killed her pet
      dog or something. She insisted that I not be formal with her, so I ended
      up just calling her by her first name. Pretty boring, huh?” “Yeah, I guess
      so,” he finally concedes after a sigh and a five second delay. He looks
      really disappointed, leaving me to wonder what kind of crazy story he was
      expecting. “Then your rendezvous last week at the school entrance wasn’t a
      thing, either? This is a waste of time man, talking to you expecting
      details. Shoulda just shut up and ate my lunch back in the classroom.”
      “Wait, back it up. How the hell do you know about last week?” “I told you,
      boy, you and Ryōgi are famous. Mostly because of Ryōgi, but whatever. Your
      rainy day get-together was this morning’s hallway talk. Since it’s about
      Ryōgi, every mouth in this damn school been talking.” I let out a
      frustrated sigh and cast a gloomy look at the sky, silently praying that
      this mess doesn’t reach ’ ears. She’d kill me. “They say this school has a
      lot of college entrants that turn out well, don’t they? I’m starting to
      wonder if people here really are that smart,” I blurt out half-jokingly.
      “Well, if it’s any consolation, at least some of the upperclassmen got
      work out of this here school,” he replies matter-of-factly. I’m about to
      make another joke at the expense of the school’s administration and
      curriculum when Gakuto chimes in again. “Seriously, though, there’s one
      thing that don’t sit right with me: of all the fine girls in this school,
      why Ryōgi? Whichever way you wanna spin it, it just don’t seem at all like
      you.” I recall being told something similar by one of my friends in the
      higher year level. I was told a more down-to-earth girl would suit me
      more, with the not-so-subtle hint that was altogether too strange. The
      words are different but I recognize the same sort of subtle insinuation in
      what Gakuto just said, and it makes me a little angry. “Oh, come off it.
      isn’t as scary as you make her out to be,” I say inadvertently. Gakuto
      suddenly makes a huge, stupid grin, as if finally claiming some elusive
      prize. “’Just a friend,’ huh? Easy, man, no need to raise your voice at
      me. Just curious, is all. Scary chicks like that don’t come a dime a
      dozen, you feel me? You not seeing how cold she is just means you already
      crazy for her.” He must mean “hard-headed and obstinate” when he says
      “cold”, because that’s the only way I’d describe . I know Gakuto’s right,
      so only with reluctance do I finally concede. “I know, alright? Okay, you
      got me, Christ.” “Then what part of her do you like? Her looks? What?” I
      have no idea what’s motivating him and his drive to ask every single
      detailed question. Well, it’s clear that is good looking, no doubt about
      it. But that’s not what really draws me to her. always looks like she’s
      hiding some invisible wound, some fragile part of her that’s on the verge
      of breaking and eating her from the inside out, killing her slowly. You
      see the emptiness in her face, her thousand-yard stare, and you realize it
      isn’t just some convenient metaphor; it’s real, somehow, and she needs
      help. I don’t want to see her get hurt. “Well, she does have her cute
      sides,” I venture hesitantly. “If I were to compare her to an animal,
      she’d be a rabbit I guess.” As soon as I say that, I regret it
      immediately. It’s a big hit with Gakuto, however, who laughs heartily upon
      hearing it almost reflexively. “A rabbit? Man, that ain’t even half right
      and you know it. If she were an animal, she’d be a hawk that can claw the
      shit outta your eyes, or some shit like that. A rabbit is just…” he tries
      to find his words amid bouts of laughter. “…just too far off the scale. Or
      wait, wait. Maybe she’s the kind of bird that dies from loneliness?”
      Another huge laugh. “That’s it. I’m not talking to you about girls
      anymore.” All of a sudden, Gakuto’s laughter stops. “Know what? A rabbit
      might’ve been a good comparison after all.” Now it is my turn to laugh,
      though I manage to suppress the urge. “Gakuto, an about-face that quick is
      pretty suspicious, don’t you think?” “Nah, nah, it ain’t about that. I
      just remembered that there’re rabbits that can bite your head off if
      you’re not careful, man.” After thinking on it perhaps a moment longer
      than I should have, I respond. “Bullshit.” “Boy, of course it’s bullshit,”
      Gakuto says, stretching his arms and leaning back on his seat. “I’m
      talking ‘bout video games, man.”
