    <p>
      That was the day when, led on by nothing except an impulse of curiosity, I
      took the main avenue on the way home. It wasn’t a shortcut, and I didn’t
      plan on passing by any particular place there. It was just something I
      decided to do on a whim. This part of the avenue was full of skyscrapers
      and tall condos, some old, more of them new, while others were abandoned
      husks, all commingled into one crowded skyline. I’d wager everybody in the
      city, including me, was tired of looking at them day in and day out. While
      walking beside the buildings, I suddenly saw something fall from a roof to
      the concrete sidewalk some distance ahead of me. It was a person. In the
      moment that that person fell, I heard a sickening sound. The wet, raw
      sound you associate with the kind of things you don’t want happening
      anywhere near you. The kind of sound you never really get to hear often.
      Judging from the height that the person fell from, it was clear that
      whoever he or she was died the instant it hit the pavement. As I drew
      closer to the point of impact, I was able to scrutinize what happened more
      clearly. All that was left, all that my mind could take in, was the
      scarlet trail seeping slowly across the asphalt; the frail, bone-like
      limbs, and the long, black hair, which still retained some of its living
      beauty. And that dead face. The scene struck my mind with the image of a
      flower pressed between the pages of an old, musty tome. Perhaps because
      the corpse, with its neck twisted, looked like a broken lily to me. It is
      a night somewhere in the beginning of August, and Mikiya comes by to visit
      without any prior notice, as per his MO. Popping open the door, I see him
      standing idly in the hallway, facing the entrance like some sort of
      servant-in-waiting. “Evening, Shiki. You look as lazy as ever,” he says,
      with a smile on his face. A strange greeting is just the kind of thing I
      expected him to do. “Have you heard?” he continues. “There was another
      jumper today, actually. This time I was actually at the scene. There’ve
      been a lot of these incidents lately, but I never thought I would actually
      come across one.” He hands me a plastic convenience store bag. “Here, in
      the fridge.” He holds the bag, arm outstretched, while untying his shoes
      and talking to me. Mikiya is nothing if not a multi-tasker. Inside the bag
      were two cups of Haagen-Dazs strawberry ice cream. I guess he wants me to
      put them inside my fridge before they melt. While checking out the
      contents of the bag, Mikiya had already undone his laces and stepped
      inside. My home is just a small apartment in a low-rise. The first thing
      you see on opening the front door is the small entryway, not even one
      meter long, where you take off your shoes. After going through that mess,
      you arrive at my one-stop bedroom-slash-living room, where Mikiya had
      already started making himself comfortable. I follow him in, glaring at
      his back while doing so. “Shiki, you’ve been skipping class again, haven’t
      you? Your grades don’t really matter, but come on; you should at least
      attend your classes. Don’t tell me you already forgot our promise to go to
      college together.” “Wiser words were never before spoken,” I reply,
      feeling particularly caustic, “especially coming from someone who dropped
      college way before I did. And sadly, this promise we supposedly made ain’t
      ringing any bells.” “Don’t start being difficult again, Shiki.” Mikiya
      tends to be a bit more blunt when you’ve got him cornered in a
      conversation; a helpful tidbit that has only recently come back to me. I
      climb on top of the bed and lie flat, Mikiya choosing to sit on the floor
      while leaning on the bed, his back facing me. This young man named Mikiya
      Kokutō has been a friend to me since high school. At least that’s what my
      head tells me. My recollections have been a bit fuzzy lately. We live in
      an age where fashion trends and the accompanying models that people want
      to look like are as apt to change as often as you blink in a day. A
      rarity, then, to still find someone like Mikiya, who steadfastly refuses
      to budge from his student-like appearance. He doesn’t dye his hair or have
      it grow into an unmanageable mess, he doesn’t tan his skin or wear
      accessories, he doesn’t carry a cellphone, and he doesn’t even allow
      himself the simple pleasures of flirting around with women. His demeanor
      struck me as the kind of person you’d probably see more ordinarily at lazy
      English train stations. His 170cm height, considerate disposition, and
      large, black rimmed glasses certainly complete the image. Not exactly
      someone you do a double-take on when you pass him by on the street, though
      it mostly due to his own fault: if he actually took the time to dress
      nicely instead of wearing somber black clothes every day, he might even be
      noticed. “Shiki, are you listening? I met your mom today, too. She said
      you haven’t really contacted your family since you got out of the hospital
      two months ago. You should at least show your face at the Ryōgi estate,
      don’t you think?” “Mmm?” I reply, as listlessly as Kokutō said I was. “I
      don’t really have any business being there, though.” “Oh, come on, isn’t
      it about time you patched things up with your folks? It’s been two years
      after all, and you haven’t talked or met with them since.” “There’s no use
      in making a pointless house call or a pointless conversation with them
      when it’ll only make us grow farther apart. It still isn’t real to me. Not
      so soon after getting out of the hospital. I mean, talking to you is still
      weird; what’ll happen if I talk to those strangers?” My patience with the
      subject grew thinner every second. I wish he would just stop pushing it.
      “Things aren’t going to get any better if it keeps up like this, you know.
      It isn’t right for you and your parents to be living so close to each
      other and not even talk.” The sudden criticism makes me frown. What
      exactly is wrong with it? There’s nothing illegal going on between me and
      my parents. It’s just that I lost some of my memories in a traffic
      accident. We’re recognized as a family by the law and by our blood, so
      there really shouldn’t be anything to talk about here. Mikiya always has
      his head in a worry about any damn person and their life issues, even
      though to me it seems like a wasteful exercise.
