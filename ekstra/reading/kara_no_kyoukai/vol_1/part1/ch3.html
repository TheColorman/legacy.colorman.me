    <p>
      The sun has already fallen as we leave the abandoned building Miss Tōko
      calls home. Shiki’s apartment is quite close by, but my apartment is about
      twenty minutes away by train. Shiki’s groggy pace and an unsteady walk
      remind me of the lack of sleep mentioned earlier, and I stay close beside
      just in case it’s needed. Out of the blue, Shiki asks me a strange
      question. “Hey, Mikiya. Do you think suicide is right?” “Hmm, let me think
      on that…,” I say, trying to drum up a good answer. “Well, let’s put it
      this way. Say I had a terribly deadly retrovirus, such that me just
      staying alive threatens all of Tokyo. If dying meant everyone would be
      saved, then maybe I’d kill myself.” “What in the hell? That’s such a
      far-fetched scenario it hurts my brain.” Shiki makes a disappointed face.
      “Let me finish, alright? Think about it for a moment. I don’t know about
      you, but I wouldn’t have the will to live while the whole of Tokyo sees me
      as the carrier of a virulent plague. Choosing suicide would be the easier
      path. An instant of determination, or a lifetime; I think you can tell
      which is the hard choice. And that’s what it boils down to, isn’t it?
      Death is the easy choice. And when push comes to shove, I don’t truly
      think I have what it takes to make the hard decision.” After that, we
      continue to walk in silence, leaving me to think more about what I said.
      In my scenario, sacrificing yourself might certainly be the right thing.
      It might even be called heroic, another one for the books. But choosing
      death for yourself, no matter the practicality of such an action, seems
      the foolish thing to do. Struggling through the slings and arrows allows
      us to put ourselves to right, and emerge as better people. That’s true
      bravery, which I don’t think I could muster. I don’t say it though, since
      I feel like Shiki is getting annoyed at me again, looking at me doubtfully
      after my answer. “Anyway,” I try to conclude awkwardly, “Each person has
      his own answers, I guess.” “You’re different, though,” says Shiki, as if
      reading my mind. Shiki said it in the usual cold front, granted, but it
      feels as if there’s a compliment in there somewhere. Slightly taken aback,
      I couldn’t bring myself to answer it, and we continue to walk through the
      city silently. Pretty soon I can hear the the bustle of people and the
      noise of engines. It sounds like we’re nearing the city’s main street,
      with its ostentatious display of lights and sounds, accompanied by the
      wave of people commuting home after a day’s work. I can just make out the
      department stores in the distance, and not too far after that is the train
      station. Shiki stops suddenly. “Mikiya, stay over at my place tonight.”
      “What in th—“ Shiki takes me by the shoulder in a gesture firmly in the
      “just fucking do it, c’mon” variety. Shiki’s apartment is closer, and it
      would be easier that way, but I don’t think I really should on moral
      grounds. “It’s all right, really,” I try to say. “It’d be boring even if I
      do go there. Or are you saying there’s something you need me to do?” I
      know there really wasn’t anything, so this should have been the end of the
      discussion, and yet Shiki looks at me accusatorily, like I was at fault.
      “Strawberry.” “Er…” “Those goddamn ice cream cups you bought a while back.
      They’re still there. Eat the damn things.” “Well, I suppose I did buy
      them.” Got me there. I bought that on a hot day on my way to Shiki’s home.
      Was it really that hot? It’s almost September after all. Well, whatever.
      Not like it matters in the grand scheme of things. Shiki’s pulling any
      excuse to get me to stay, and I suppose I have no choice but to follow.
      But I can at least make a feeble attempt to strike back. There is a
      topic—serving almost like a trigger—which, when brought to discussion,
      makes Shiki mad but unable to retort back properly. It’s about something I
      really want Shiki to do, but in this matter, the universe seems to have
      seen it proper to bestow upon Shiki the stubbornness of mules. “I can see
      there’s no persuading you. All right, I’ll stay over. But Shiki…” Harsh
      eyes look at me, and I respond with as serious a face I can muster. “’Eat
      the damn thing?’ Such unseemly words. I’d really like it if you did
      something about that. I mean, you are a girl after all.” Right on target.
      After I say “girl,” she points a finger at her lips and says “Hey, my
      mouth, my choice of words. Got it?”
