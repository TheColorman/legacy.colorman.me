    <p>
      That was the day when, led on by nothing except an impulse of curiosity, I
      took the main avenue on the way home. It wasn’t a shortcut, and I didn’t
      plan on passing by any particular place there. It was just something I
      decided to do on a whim. This part of the avenue was full of skyscrapers
      and tall condos, some old, more of them new, while others were abandoned
      husks, all commingled into one crowded skyline. I’d wager everybody in the
      city, including me, was tired of looking at them day in and day out. While
      walking beside the buildings, I suddenly saw something fall from a roof to
      the concrete sidewalk a ways ahead of me. It was a person. In the moment
      that that person fell, I heard a sickening sound. The wet, raw sound you
      associate with the kind of things you don’t want happening anywhere near
      you. The kind of sound you never really get to hear often. Judging from
      the height that the person fell from, it was clear that whoever he or she
      was died the instant it hit pavement. As I drew closer to the point of
      impact, I was able to scrutinize what happened more clearly. All that was
      left, all that my mind could take in, was the scarlet trail seeping across
      the asphalt; the frail, bone-like limbs, and the long, black hair, which
      still retained some of its living beauty. And that dead face. The scene
      struck my mind with the image of a flower pressed between the pages of an
      old, musty tome. It all seemed vaguely familiar. I knew what happened
      here. In the end, I suppose she chose the true slumber, instead of the
      lie. A throng of people had already begun to gather around, and Azaka and
      I soon had to work our way through them, avoiding the crowd. “Miss Tōko,
      that was a jumper, wasn’t it?” “I suppose,” I answer almost
      absent-mindedly. My part in this case had long since played out. Society
      had better things to do than psychoanalyze a jumper that just decided to
      take a tumble out of a building. In the end, they’d say one suicide is no
      different from the next. Kirie’s last wish, right up to the end, was not
      flight, or even floating, but to fall. A pity, but it’s best not to dwell
      on it for long. “I’ve heard there were quite a lot of cases last year, but
      I guess it’s still a trend, huh? I don’t really understand what goes
      through these people’s minds, though. Would you, Miss Tōko?” 38 • KINOKO
      NASU I nod my head; another vague answer. I look up at the sky, training
      my vision on an illusion of the light. “She had no reason to kill
      herself,” I say finally. “She just wasn’t able to fly.”
