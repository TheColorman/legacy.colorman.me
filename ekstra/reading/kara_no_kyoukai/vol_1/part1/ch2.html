    <p>
      I see a dragonfly, beating its wings. A butterfly follows it, but its pace
      doesn’t slacken. The butterfly tries to keep up with the dragonfly, but it
      is a futile effort. As it flies further, I see a glimpse of the butterfly
      as its strength failed and gravity took hold. It makes an arc as it falls,
      and then trails its way to the ground like a snake, or a broken lily. A
      sad and cruel scene. Perhaps, even if they could not travel together, they
      could have kept each other company for a while longer. But I knew that was
      impossible. To something like the dragonfly, whose feet don’t touch the
      earth, even such freedom was denied. I hear the distinct buzz of
      conversation, and I wake up. My eyelids were screaming for two more hours
      of sleep, even as my mind warred between sleeping and waking. In the end,
      the battle was won by the latter, and I set to work on the laborious task
      of opening my eyelids. Sometimes, I wonder if I worry about these things
      too much. I was up all night working on the blueprints and diagrams, and I
      must have fallen asleep in Miss Tōko’s room. I raise myself up from the
      sofa with a hint of enthusiasm, pushing up my glasses so I could see
      better, and I realize that this was indeed the office. The office was a
      cluttered place full of occult oddities and research that Miss Tōko had
      accumulated throughout the years. The midday sunlight illuminated this
      mess, as well as the two people conversing; Shiki, wearing a smooth kimono
      as always, was leaning with back to the wall, and Miss Tōko was sitting
      cross-legged on a chair. Miss Tōko always dressed smart, with thin black
      pants and a collared white blouse that seemed to look new every time you
      meet her. Combined with her short hair and the way it made her neck show,
      it gave her the image of a company secretary, though I thought that with
      her scary, piercing look, especially if she didn’t have her glasses on, it
      would probably be impossible that she would ever get such a job.
      “’Morning, Kokutō.” Miss Tōko gave a glance in my direction, like she
      always does, to acknowledge my presence. No glasses were worn over her
      hawk eyed glare today, a sign that she and Shiki were probably talking
      business. “I’m sorry, ma’am. I guess I fell asleep.” “Don’t start with
      excuses. I can see well enough. If you’re fully with us on planet Earth
      now, then go make something to drink. A cup of coffee would be good. It
      should warm your bones a bit after that long rest.” Long rest? Well, I did
      feel exceptionally tired, so it wasn’t a completely strange thing to say.
      I don’t know why Miss Tōko would say it, but she’s always talking
      cryptically at the best of times anyway, so not asking her has become the
      standard operating procedure. “How about you, Shiki? Need a drink?” I
      managed to ask in my groggy state, only half aware of my surroundings.
      “Nah, I’m good. I’m about to hit the sack soon, anyway.” Lazy eyes and
      sagging shoulders tell the story of Shiki’s sleeplessness well enough.
      Probably went and did another one of those nightly strolls again last
      night. Next to Miss Tōko’s office room was another one that served the
      purposes of a kitchen, at least to her. To me, it looked more like a
      laboratory, or at the very least it used to look like one. The sink had
      three faucets in a row, just like you’d see in a lab. Two of those had
      wires strapped around them, either disabled or possessing some unearthly,
      forbidden function , the operation of which I suspect only passed between
      God and Miss Tōko. God sure wasn’t revealing anything, and Miss Tōko is of
      the same mindset, and I was in no particular rush to find out. Either way,
      it gave the entire room a disturbing air. I turn on the coffee maker, and
      it emits a low hum as it processes the drink. The first thing I do upon
      arriving here every day is make coffee for Miss Tōko, so it’s come to the
      point where I could do it with my eyes closed. It’s been almost half a
      year since I’ve started working for her. “Work” in this case being a very
      loose term. This place could hardly be called your typical office
      environment. Despite that, I stay on, probably because I saw something in
      what she worked on. Just after Shiki lapsed into a coma, I graduated high
      school and entered college with no motivation or any particular purpose.
      At some point back in our high school days, me and Shiki made a deal to go
      to college together. Even if Shiki had no hope of waking up, I still
      wanted to keep that promise. But my life after Shiki’s coma was one of
      aimless drifting, just watching the calendar as the days swept past. One
      day I was invited by an acquaintance to a doll and puppet exhibit, and it
      was there that I found it: A doll in the shape and size of a human, so
      finely made that it must have taken its craftsman years of hard work; some
      measure of his soul went into that doll. Though I knew it was just a doll
      like anything else there, it looked more like a human being, frozen in
      place, and one I was sure would move any second now, if someone breathed
      into it. A thing on the brink of existence, but didn’t live, preserved on
      the boundary that no one else walked. I was attracted to that
      contradiction, maybe because it reminded me so much of the person that
      Shiki was before. Apparently, the maker of the doll was unknown. Even the
      pamphlet of the exhibit didn’t mention any names. I dove into
      investigation, desperately seeking the person who could craft such a
      beautiful doll. It turned out to be someone not entirely connected to the
      business of doll making, and did it with no real intent for fame. A
      mysterious recluse named Tōko Aozaki. Apparently she makes dolls as her
      main occupation, but was also an architect on the side. She seemed to be
      involved in just generally “making” things, whatever those thing may be,
      but she never accepts requests. Mysteriously, she just knows who needs
      things made, goes to them, announces her intent, and proceeds to make
      whatever it is they want after receiving a generous advance payment. She
      must be the world’s greatest freelance craftsman, or the world’s biggest
      weirdo. I got even more interested in finding her after that, even though
      I got a sense that I really should have quit at that point. Something
      seemed to pull at my effort, almost as if she didn’t want to be found out.
      Eventually, through much time and record searching, I found out she lived
      in some place away from the city, not in the suburbs, or the industrial
      district. It wasn’t even a house. It’s an abandoned building. Well, to be
      more specific, it’s a building where construction was stopped when it was
      halfway done, probably because whoever funded it ran out of money. It has
      the shape of a building, seen from afar, but inside the floor and walls
      are bare. It was left as it was, neglected and surrendered to time and the
      weather. Had it been completed, it would have had six floors, but there’s
      nothing above the fourth floor. Nowadays it would be more efficient to
      start the bulk of the construction from the top, but I guess they were
      still using the old methods back then. Now the fifth floor has been
      dragooned into the service of a roof. Though surrounded by a high concrete
      wall, anyone who wanted to go in would have an easy time of it, since the
      gate was always open. It’s a miracle the local kids don’t mess around in
      it. They probably just see it as some suspicious, dangerous building they
      should stay out of. Pretty convenient. I don’t know if Miss Tōko really
      bought the building, but it seems that way, so for now, she stays here.
      The laboratory-slash-coffee room I’m in right now is situated on the
      fourth floor, and the second and third are Miss Tōko’s various offices,
      storage rooms, and workshops, so we usually talk shop on the fourth floor.
      After finding Miss Tōko, I got to know her and asked for employment of
      some sort, just to sate my interest in this master craftswoman. I quit
      college, and started working for her. And amazingly enough, I actually get
      paid. She once said to me that humans can be divided into two types with
      two attributes: those who craft and search, and those who use and destroy.
      She made it clear to me that I wasn’t someone who “crafted” but one who
      “searched” or some such, and that’s why she hired me. “Running a little
      late there, Kokutō,” said an accusatory voice from the other room. It was
      Miss Tōko, her patience obviously running thin. Well, the coffee maker’s
      just about done, and the black liquid sits there, waiting to be drunk.
      “Yesterday makes the eighth,” Miss Tōko says abruptly, while stubbing out
      her cigarette. “Soon people are going to take notice of their connection.”
      She is, of course, talking about the recent case of high school girls
      falling to their deaths. There’s nothing else to talk about anyway, so I
      guess this was as good a topic as any. But wait…eight? “Huh? Weren’t there
      only six people?” “A few more popped up while you still had sand in your
      eyes. All this started in June, and it’s been going at about three per
      month. Maybe another one’ll happen before the next three days are out,
      eh?” Miss Tōko is in the habit of saying really ominous things, so I’m
      kind of used to it. I take a quick glance at the calendar, noticing that
      there’s only three days left in August. For a moment, a flash of worry
      enters my mind for some reason, but I quickly dismiss it. “They’re saying
      the suicides have no relation, though,” I remark. “Different schools, no
      friends of the third degree or anything like that. It could still turn out
      that the police are withholding information from the media to better their
      chances when they interview the perp…if this case even has one.” “What,
      Kokutō, you don’t trust the police on this one? That sleep must have
      really done a number on you to suddenly be skeptical of people like that.”
      She grins. As usual, her spite knows no bounds when her glasses are off.
      “Because they didn’t leave behind a suicide note, right?” I explain.
      “Suicidals usually leave behind a note or some sort of last message to the
      living. I mean, what is it six…erm, eight people now? At least one of them
      should have done it. That only means one of two things: that the police
      aren’t publicizing the note so that it serves as leverage against a
      suspect, or it could mean a statistical improbability.” “Which by itself
      becomes the only thing connecting these incidents,” says Miss Tōko. “The
      girls weren’t taking drugs, nor were they members of some weird cult. By
      all accounts their lives were perfectly mundane. Neither their family nor
      their friends know any reason why they would throw themselves off a
      building. So it follows that they probably killed themselves over some
      emotional or psychological distress, or perhaps to prove something. That’s
      why they don’t leave behind any last words.” “So you’re saying that it’s
      not that the police are hiding anything, it’s that they truly didn’t have
      any suicide note?” I ask. “Well, statistically speaking, most people don’t
      leave behind any note when they commit suicide…but yeah.” Miss Tōko leans
      back on her chair, sipping her coffee while looking at me funny. I put a
      mug to my own lip and tip it, tasting the bitter coffee inside. I think
      back on what she said, something nagging me in the reasoning. How could
      there be no suicide note? It didn’t fit. The girls were, as far as we
      knew, all happy and content, very much attached to the world of the
      living. In a situation where one is forced to die, final words are what
      you leave behind to cement that connection. Not doing so means you have
      nothing to leave to this world, and you can decide to bravely face that
      great unknown of death. A suicide without a note, or parting words, or
      even the remote chance of discovery of the incident: that would be the
      perfect suicide. Jumping off a building, then, is far from the perfect
      suicide. Such an exhibitionist act makes the suicide clear and
      attention-grabbing. In a way, the suicide and the resulting publicity
      itself results in having the air of a “suicide note”, so to speak. If the
      suicidals picked as obvious and public a method as jumping off a building,
      then they did so knowing they would be seen by many. Publicity formed at
      least a part of their choice of death. In that case, why the lack of
      parting words at all? I can think of only one reason. Perhaps, like Shiki
      said once, they were just accidents, or at the very least, they did not
      intend to die. Then they wouldn’t have any reason to write a suicide note,
      just like running into a traffic accident while going home from school.
      Unfortunately, I can’t fathom why you’d jump off from a building while
      taking your daily commute from school, though. “There won’t be any more
      girls hitting the pavement for a while after the eighth, ‘least not ones
      related to these incidents.” Shiki, now standing beside the window, joins
      the conversation. “How could you possibly know that?” I say. “How else? I
      checked. There were eight of them floating around that building. I took
      care of ‘em, but they’ll be there for a little while longer, even if it
      does make me sick.” Shiki faces away from the window, posing with arms
      crossed. “Say, Tōko, do all people end up flying that way when they bite
      the bullet?” “No one really knows for sure. Everyone’s different. All I
      can offer you is an observation.” Miss Tōko puts down her cup, her smile
      morphing into a more scholarly demeanor, as if she was about to teach the
      most important thing in the world. “The words ‘flying’ and ‘falling’ are
      inextricably tied to each other, because we humans can’t fly by ourselves.
      And yet, as expected of men, the more we reach for the sky, the more we
      forget this. Even those who live after death can try and reach for this
      goal, to fall towards the sky, forgetting that it is the hubris of Icarus
      that led to his doom.” Shiki seemed perturbed by Miss Tōko’s cryptic
      response, more so than usual. I can only guess as to what offensive
      statement Miss Tōko said that has Shiki in such a defensive attitude. I
      decide to break the mood. “Er, I’m sorry ma’am, but I can’t seem to
      understand the topic.” “Apologies, Kokutō. We’re talking about the ghost
      at the Fujō Tower. I don’t really know if it’s the real thing or just some
      mage’s illusion. I wanted to check, but if Shiki really killed it, then
      there’s no way to know for sure now.” So it was about that. The
      conversations between Shiki and glasses-off-Miss Tōko are always about the
      occult and the magical, so it wasn’t that hard to guess anyway. “You know
      that Shiki saw those girls floating around in the Fujō Tower, correct?
      Turns out there was another human figure flying around among those
      floating girls. Since they couldn’t be removed, we figured perhaps that
      place was something akin to a net to them, or something along those
      lines.” In my mind, I am frowning at this story’s sudden turn for the
      complex, and then, as if sensing my confusion, she offers her layman’s
      summary of it. “Well, to put it a bit more simply, there is one girl
      floating around that building, and tagging along with her are what looks
      like our famous suicide girls. I suspect that they’re something like
      ghosts or some other supernatural occurrence. The end.” I nod my
      understanding, but the way Shiki put it, I gather that the deed was
      already done and taken care of. Once again, the story seems far past me.
      It’s only been three months since I let these two get to know each other,
      but already I’m the one lagging behind on their peculiar conversations.
      Not that I had any particular interest in being involved in them either
      way. However, since being ignored was also an unacceptable outcome, I
      listen anyway. The way I’m stuck between their stranger world and my own
      willing or unwilling ignorance of it sort of fits me, in a way. It’s one
      of those small blessings I can be thankful for. “That sounds like a story
      out of a dime novel,” I blurt out. Miss Tōko nods her agreement, smiling.
      Shiki, on the other hand, is somehow growing more wound up, casting
      accusatory sidelong glances at me. Because provoking a reaction out of
      Shiki works about as often as Mercury in retrograde, I have to wonder if I
      did something colossally idiotic without my knowing again. “But then,
      Shiki saw the ghosts only at the beginning of July, right?” I sound dumb
      for asking the obvious, but I do it just to confirm. “So there were only
      four ghosts back then, Shiki?” A negative shaking of the head from Shiki.
      “No, no, there were eight, right from the start. I told you right? There
      wouldn’t be any more suicides after the eighth. In their case, the order
      is reversed.” “Uh huh. You gotta clarify with me whether or not you’ve
      gained any future predicting powers like that one girl we talked to some
      time ago.” “It’s not like that, Mikiya. It’s more like that place…the air
      there isn’t normal. How do I put this?” Shiki’s voice uncharacteristically
      wavers a bit as a proper description fails to materialize. “It’s sort of
      like a strange sensation of being in the middle of boiling water and
      freezing water.” As Shiki struggles with vocabulary, Miss Tōko steps in to
      help. “It means that time there flows differently. Understand that there
      is more than one way for time to progress. The speed upon which entropy
      acts on something differs for each object. The same holds true for our
      memories. When a person dies, the record of him existing doesn’t disappear
      instantly. There are people who remember, people who have observed and
      watched over his life and death. As long as these exist, the memories…, or
      rather, their record of existence, doesn’t suddenly disappear, but only
      fades into nothingness. If the observer of death was not a person, but
      instead a place that resonates to people such as those girls, then they
      will remain even after death as a sort of image, of wandering ‘ghosts’, or
      what have you. The only ones receptive to this image are the ones that
      share and keep the memory of these ghosts, such as close friends and
      family. And people like Shiki and me, of course.” Miss Tōko lights another
      cigarette before continuing. “Entropy acts on memory too. People forget,
      and eventually the memories disappear. But on the roof of the Fujō Tower,
      the entropy of those memories are slower, as if the building itself
      doesn’t want to forsake them. The record of their time alive hasn’t caught
      up to their current state, and as a result, the memories, and the images
      of those girls remain, in that place where time is crooked and broken.”
      Miss Tōko seems to finish her explanation, which I suspect managed to be
      even more puzzling than what Shiki would have eventually gotten to. So
      what she’s saying is that, when something dies or is lost, that thing
      doesn’t truly disappear, as long as someone remembers it. And that
      remembering it is to acknowledge its existence, and because of that, it
      can sometimes be seen again. That just sounds like deluding yourself.
      Well, Miss Tōko probably kept using the word “image” because it is
      something of a delusion, a thing that can’t be real. In a surprisingly
      frank display of annoyance, Shiki is led to that timeless impulse of
      headscratching. “Enough of these explanations, already. What I’m really
      worried about is her. My knife did a pretty good job of proving my point,
      but if there’s actually some mage using projection, then this’ll never
      end.” Another soild glance comes my way. “I’m tired of being Mikiya’s
      guardian, thank you very much.” “I agree completely, Shiki. I’ll settle
      things with Kirie Fujō, so just go on and take Kokutō home…wait, he still
      has five hours to clock in, so you might want to sleep. You can use that
      place.” Miss Tōko pointed to a spot on the floor that looks like it hasn’t
      been cleaned for at least half a year, littered with paper like a dirty
      furnace. Shiki, naturally, ignores her. “So what was she, anyway?” Shiki
      asks Miss Tōko. The mage walks over to the window and stares outside, her
      footsteps inaudible, and with a cigarette still in her mouth. We don’t
      really have any light in this room, not electric light anyway. All the
      light comes from outside, and in certain areas of the building where the
      sun doesn’t reach, it can be surprisingly difficult to tell the time. In
      contrast, the view outside is clearly morning, perhaps somewhere closer to
      noon. For a few moments, Miss Tōko stares silently at the sun-bathed
      panorama. “Before, you could have said that she flew.” She puffs out a
      cloud of smoke, indistinguishable now from the white sunlight. From my
      position, framed by the sunlight and smoke, she looked like some sort of
      mirage. “Kokutō, what would you associate with a high place? What imagery
      comes to mind?” The sudden question snaps me back into focus. The only
      thing I could think about was the time I went atop Tokyo Tower. I remember
      trying real hard to spot my house, but in the end I couldn’t make it out
      among the many tall buildings I saw. “Maybe…small things?” “Trying a bit
      too hard there, Kokutō.” Well, fine, I didn’t think that answer through
      too much anyway. I try to think of something else. “Well, I can’t really
      think of anything in particular, but I do think that a panoramic view is
      beautiful. Just the sight of the scenery is overwhelming.” This was a more
      spontaneous response, which she somehow seems to note, acknowledging it
      with a little nod while still staring at the window. And like that, she
      continued to talk. “Scenery seen from select vantage points is always
      wonderful. Even an otherwise mundane landscape becomes something special.
      Looking down at the world you live in, though, stimulates a different
      urge. In such a commanding view, there is but one impulse.” As the word
      “impulse” leaves her mouth, she cuts off her sentence. An impulse isn’t
      something that comes from reason or intelligence, not something that comes
      from within, but something that is triggered by an external force, even if
      one rejects it. Like a murderous, destructive urge. Then what is the
      destructive impulse that a view from on high brings? “It’s how far
      everything is. A view too wide makes clear the boundary between you and
      the world. People can only rest easy with things they are familiar with.
      Even with an accurate map telling you your exact location, you know that’s
      only information. To us, the world only amounts to something we understand
      and feel from experience. The boundaries and connections of the world, and
      of countries, and of cities, are only constructs of the mind, not
      something we feel ourselves. But with a view too wide, there appear gaps
      in our understanding. You have a ten meter radius that you feel, and the
      ten kilometer space that you’re looking down on. They’re both one and the
      same, the same world that you’ve been living in, and yet the first one
      feels more real. You see, now we have come upon a paradox. Rather than
      recognize the small world you can feel as the world you live in, you
      ascribe it to the wide world you can only see. But within this wide world,
      you cannot feel that you truly exist. Because the closer objects are to
      your person, the more sure you can be of their existence, of their
      reality. In this way, reason, represented by your knowledge, and
      experience, represented by instinct, will start to conflict. Eventually,
      one will lose, and confusion sets in. ‘Viewing the city from up here sure
      puts it into perspective. I can’t believe my house was down there. Did the
      park always look that way? I didn’t even know that street or that alley or
      that building ever existed! This is a city I’ve never seen before, like
      I’ve gone far, far away.’ Those are the sort of thoughts that run through
      your head in a panoramic view.” In a lull in her speech, I manage to sneak
      in a question which has been nagging me since the start. “So, what,
      looking out from a vantage point is somehow bad now?” “Only if you gaze
      for too long. Remember that in the old myths, traveling the sky was akin
      to traveling another world. To fly was to ascend to a higher world, or
      perhaps to meet one’s final reward in the afterlife. Mortals who ascended
      the skies became mad, unless they armed themselves with charms or the
      power of reason. And always, lunacy was cured by returning to solid
      ground.” Now that she mentions it, I did have this indescribable urge to
      jump from the school roof once, just to see what would happen if I did. It
      must run through everybody’s minds at some point, when looking at that
      view. Of course, I didn’t really want to do it, but why did I think that
      way when it clearly leads to my own death? Why do other people think that
      way? “Does that mean that, if only for a moment, you go mad?’ After I
      mention the question, Miss Tōko bursts into laughter. “Kokutō, you have to
      understand that thinking that is normal. Dig into people’s dreams and you
      find them dreaming the taboo, eventually. We possess the extraordinary
      ability of indulging our own fantasies with our own imagination. Though
      you are right in a way. What’s important is that we know that the fantasy
      has its place. Well, I guess that’s obvious. But in your example, it’s
      less ‘crazy’ and more like a ‘numbing of thought.’” “Tōko, this has gone
      on long enough.” Shiki interrupts, sick of the one-sided conversation.
      Well, we have drifted quite far from the main topic so it wouldn’t be
      uncalled for in this case. “There’s nothing long about it. In fact, were
      this an actual thought experiment, we’d only be ankle deep into it.”
      “Well, cut it down to a phrase, will you? When you and Mikiya talk, it’s
      like a goddamn thesis committee.” Strong words, but words which I can
      accept have an all too valid point. “Shiki…” Miss Tōko starts, rubbing her
      temple in frustration, but Shiki continues to complain, ignoring the both
      of us. “And then there’s this business of views from high places. I hope
      you remember that just by walking around, we’re already ‘viewing from a
      high place’ already.” Air quotations by Shiki. “There’s no ‘normal view’
      by your logic.” Well, someone’s wound up. As expected, Shiki’s already
      trying to punch holes in Miss Tōko’s argument. Certainly, a person’s eyes
      are higher than the ground, which would qualify them for a “high place”, I
      guess. Miss Tōko nods in approval at Shiki, and continues her speech,
      probably condensed now for the sake of Shiki’s temper. “Even if we count
      the fact that the ground isn’t actually flat but at an angle, we also
      don’t usually call our normal vision to be a ‘commanding’ or ‘overlooking’
      view. There’s a reason for that. Your vision isn’t exactly as your eyes
      see it, but something more of a signal the mind interprets and
      comprehends. Protected as we are by our ‘common sense’, we don’t perceive
      such sight as ‘high’, and we don’t call it such. It’s ‘normal’…whatever
      nebulous value anyone might ascribe to that word. Our mental perceptions,
      on the other hand, also stand perched on its own vantage point. Different
      minds perceive different things, but all are imprisoned, asleep in a
      paradigm of material reality. Awakened minds bearing a more malleable
      paradigm, such as those of mages, can bend its rules, but never truly
      break them. To cross that boundary is to become something more and less
      human. A god, but absent the restraint. And so Hypnos becomes Thanatos.”
      As she says this, Miss Tōko continues to look out at the window, in a
      commanding view of the street, the town—perhaps the world. She’s looking
      at the world with her feet firmly in the ground, which I thought was
      important for some reason. I suddenly remember my dream. Before it ended,
      I remember the butterfly fell towards the ground. Were the butterfly not
      so intent to follow me, she could have flown more gracefully. If she had
      just floated and not flapped her wings so hard, she could have flown
      longer. But perhaps, seeing the dragonfly and how it flew, it could no
      longer bear to just float. That’s why it flew. Miss Tōko threw her
      expended cigarette out the window. “The fluctuation at the Fujō Tower
      might have been her perception of the world. The uneasiness in the air
      that Shiki felt were the bars of the prison. A place steeped in numina.” A
      few seconds pass without Miss Tōko saying a word, which Shiki and I take
      as a sign that she’s finally finished talking. The long sigh and wandering
      eyes tell me that Shiki’s melancholic demeanor calms down at last. “Bars
      of the prison, huh? I wonder if that girl was inside or outside.” Saying
      this dismissively, Shiki’s head is tilted to one side, tired of talking.
      “Well, I’d say wherever you are, she’s on the opposite side,” counters
      Miss Tōko. It’s 2:00 in the morning, and the bone in my nape creaks from
      the cold. I shiver in spite of myself, and I wonder if it’s the chill
      that’s doing it, or my own mind. For the moment, I cast aside my
      reservations and enter the Fujō Tower, no sight or sound of life
      indicating any sort of welcome for me. Only the electric light
      illuminating the cream-colored walls of the entrance hallway, a light that
      looked too artificial and lacking in human warmth that it ended up being
      more eerie than the darkness it was supposed to sweep away. At the
      entrance lies a card checker for the former tennants, now unused and
      broken. Without stopping, I pass by it, going through the hallway and into
      an elevator. The situation is the same as it looked outside: no people
      except for me. The elevator has one of those mirrors that people can use
      to ogle themselves while they wait. It reflects a person wearing a light
      blue kimono with a black leather jacket, with the lazy eyes of someone
      tired of doing this job. I press the button that leads to the rooftop
      while looking at my reflection in the mirror. With nothing but the low hum
      of the elevator accompanying me, I wait as the world begins to rise. For
      now until this mechanical box reaches the rooftop, this elevator is a
      prison. The events of the outside are from an entirely different world, an
      entirely different existence. For now, this is all that is real. I allow
      this thought to slip into my mind unbidden, though I should be focusing on
      the task at hand. The sliding door opens with only the slightest hint of a
      sound, leading into a small storage room whose only feature is the door
      leading outside to the rooftop. The room has this oppressive lack of light
      that makes me think that the door to the roof opens to that different
      world I fleetingly felt, the world that I saw in the reflective circus of
      the buildings’ windows. It’s a boundary of emptiness. Crossing the room
      with my footsteps resounding against the narrow space, I open the door.
      The room is black as pitch, but it melds into the now visible void of the
      endless night sky. My eyes take in the view of the city from on high.
      There was nothing special about the Fujō Tower. It had a perfectly
      constructed and level floor made of concrete, and a chain-link fence
      surrounding the roof. Aside from the water tank that stood atop the room I
      just exited out of, there isn’t anything else here. Except for the view.
      The height is at least ten stories higher than any building in the
      vicinity, giving it a lonely feeling. It’s like being on top of a tall
      ladder, staring down into the depths of the world below you. If the world
      below were the ocean, then the scattered lights of buildings would be the
      anglerfish, the only lights in an otherwise black world where neither
      sunlight nor moonlight reach. A beautiful sight. The world is sleeping,
      perhaps for eternity, but unfortunately only for the moment. The stillness
      grips my heart tighter than any cold wind, and it feels painful. Stars
      glitter in the sky like jewels, and the moon is out, brighter than
      anything. In my education at the family manor, I was taught that the moon
      was not the sun’s mirror, but a window to a different reality. A polar
      opposite to stand as a gate to twilight. The moon has long been associated
      with the arcane, femininity, and death. And as that moon shines brightly
      over our world, the figure of a woman floats eerily in the sky above,
      silhouetted harshly against the moonlight, accompanied by eight girls
      flying around her. The floating woman specter is wearing a white cloth
      that looked like it could pass for a dress, and she has black hair that
      reaches down all the way to her waist. What little you can see of her arms
      and legs through the cloth reveal how slender she is. Her eyebrows, too,
      follow this mold, and her eyes hold inside them piercing cold, making her
      countenance one of the most beautiful I’ve seen. From her looks, I’d say
      she’s in her early twenties, though it’s probably foolish to attach
      anything like “age” to something like a ghost. And yet she doesn’t possess
      the distorted air of a ghost that marks them so well. She looks as if she
      could pass muster for being alive. The girls swimming in the air around
      her, who fade in and out of sight, look more the part. Above me, this
      lonely procession continued; the womanly figure, and the girls floating in
      a protective formation. I found it unsettling, not so much repulsive, but
      more like… “I see. This is all a spell of yours, isn’t it?” I sneer. I
      didn’t notice it before now, but I note the woman’s face again, seeing
      some inhuman quality to its beauty. Were the wind blowing strongly
      tonight, her smooth black hair, each strand finely combed, would strike an
      otherworldly chord in anyone’s heart. Otherworldly, and inhuman. “Then I’m
      gonna have to kill you.” As if noticing me for the first time, the woman’s
      eyes finally cast downward, and I return the favor, our eyes taking in
      each other’s measure. No more words are spoken. None are needed. From
      inside my jacket, I draw a blade, a fine weapon seven inches in length.
      The woman’s gaze from above fills me with the urge to kill. The beautiful
      white dress sways in the air. The slender arm moves like water, and points
      an accusatory finger at me. Those slender limbs no longer seem beautiful,
      and look more fragile now. “Like a bone, or a lily.” Tonight, there was no
      wind, and my voice reverberated in the night sky. You can fly. When the
      woman points her finger at me, I hear a voice intruding in my
      consciousness; perhaps hers, were she able to speak. It buries itself
      inside, digging in, and telling me I can fly. The mental assault makes me
      lose balance for a moment, but with only one step I regain composure.
      Overhead, the woman hesitates. Now I see. You must fly. She tries again,
      this time stronger, more assertive. It is met with similar resistance. And
      then, finally, finally, my Eyes look at her. And there they are. One on
      each leg, one on her back, a little one in her left chest. I can see the
      lines, separating her body into little sections. The one in her chest is
      likely the best target. Hitting that’d mean instant death. This woman
      could be some sort of image, some delusion, or a ghost. But in the end it
      doesn’t matter. Because with my Eyes, even gods can die. Holding my knife
      in a reverse grip, edge-out, I raise my right hand, narrowing my gaze at
      my enemy while doing so. But she attacks me again. I can fly. I can fly. I
      loved the sky since I was a child. I flew yesterday too. I can fly higher
      today. Freely. Peacefully. Smiling. I have to go quickly. To where? To the
      sky? To freedom? Let’s escape from reality! Yearn for the sky! Fight
      gravity. Be restless enough not to stay in one place. Fly unconsciously.
      Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go.
      Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go. GO! “You gotta be fucking kidding, right?” I
      raise my free left hand. The mental suggestion doesn’t work. I don’t even
      lose my balance anymore. “Can’t seem to take a liking to flying. Don’t
      know how to feel alive—been that way for a while—so I don’t know the pain
      of living. To be honest, I don’t really give a damn about you,” I murmur,
      almost singing it. It’s true though. Joy and sorrow, freedom and
      restraint; I can’t feel any of them. That’s why I can’t see this fuss
      about being liberated from pain. “But taking him was a big mistake.
      Finders keepers, and I found him first. You’re going to give him back.” My
      left hand grabs the air like a rope, and I pull back. The woman and the
      other girls are pulled towards me, like a fisherman plucking a good catch.
      The woman’s expression changes. She tries her last, vain hope of
      controlling me, trying her best to put as much power into her suggestion.
      FALL! And again, I disregard it completely. With all the firmness in my
      voice I can muster, I answer her back. “You fall.” As she comes toward me,
      I plunge the knife deep into her chest, as naturally as I do stabbing a
      fruit, and so exquisitely performed that it gives even the victim pause
      for admiration. The knife runs from front to back, clean through her. She
      doesn’t bleed. Unable to move from the shock of being stabbed straight
      through, she convulses just once. With only a nudge and a slight movement
      of my right arm, I fling away the useless “corpse”, and the incorporeal
      body slips through the fence without a sound into the shining city below.
      Her hair still lies motionless, and her dress embraces the darkness, a
      white flower sinking to the bottom of the ocean. And with that, I depart
      from the roof, the ghosts still floating in the air behind me. With the
      impact of steel lightning on my chest, I awaken. It was a staggering
      attack, one that proved how strong my opponent was, if one can drive
      through a person’s chest that easily. But it wasn’t a strike born out of
      anger, or desperation. A singular thrust delivered with no wasted energy,
      one that would slide easily in between bone and sinew. It wasn’t the pain
      that hurt me. Rather, it was the feeling of me being ripped apart, and the
      sound of the knife plunging deep, deep into my heart. That incomparably
      bittersweet fear. My body shook and trembled at the thought of it. My
      silent weeping contained my uneasiness, my loneliness, my will to live. My
      tears aren’t from the pain either, or from the fear of the encounter. It
      was for the brush of death that I had never before experienced, but had
      now fallen in love with, even though I pray every night for the strength
      to live. I hear the distinct sound of the door opening, a sound that I
      have grown very familiar with. Even though I know it’s nighttime, the far
      off glow of the buildings in the city induces the same sensation as
      sunlight. It’s not yet time for my regular examination, so the person who
      came must be a visitor. I have a private room, so I’m almost always alone.
      My sole company here is the bed, the cream colored curtain which never
      flutters in the wind, and the lights from the outside world, ghostly yet
      radiant. “Excuse me. You would be Kirie Fujō, correct?” Even her deep
      voice can’t mask that the visitor is a woman. After greeting me, she goes
      to my bedside, ignoring the chair and choosing instead to stare down at me
      coldly. A frightening person, one who I feel can destroy me with a snap of
      her fingers if she so wished. Yet, in my heart, I still feel happy. It’s
      been many years since I had any sort of visitor. I couldn’t turn her away,
      even if she is Death herself come to take me. “And you are the enemy,
      correct?” I reply. The woman nods. Perhaps it may just be the light from
      the faint shining beacons of the city, but when I try to focus my vision
      on the visitor, I can barely see her. Her clothes are without blemish,
      reminding me of the neatness of a school teacher. It makes me rest more
      easily, somehow. The gaudy orange necktie she wears contrasts sharply with
      her white blouse, however, making her look vaguely amusing. “Do you know
      that child who stabbed me?” I say apprehensively, “or perhaps it is you?”
      “No, fortunately. I’m an acquaintance of your attacker and your victim.
      One of them anyway. We meet the strangest people, you and I.” She takes
      out something from her breast pocket, but puts it away just as quickly.
      “Apologies. Smoking isn’t allowed here I suppose? For someone with lung
      damage like you, it would be like poison.” I guess what she took out was a
      cigarette carton. The image of her smoking fits her look, I think, like a
      mannequin with lizard pumps and a bag. “But it isn’t just the lung, is
      it?” Her voice is one of curiosity as she looks me over. “Certainly,
      that’s where it all started, but there are tumors all over your body.
      Sarcoma is only the beginning, but it’s worse inside. Your hair is the
      only thing that’s left. You have much strength. A normal person would have
      died long before as this sickness ate them alive.” She pauses a moment to
      look at me straight, then offers a smile. “How long has this gone on,
      Kirie Fujō?” I can’t answer. “I have no idea. I stopped keeping count.”
      Because there’s no meaning to it. Because dying was the only way out of
      here. She murmurs a soft-breathed “I see.” I hated her voice that lacked
      any compassion or hate. The only thing I can receive from people is their
      sympathy, and she denies me even that. “Shiki told me the cut was around
      the area of the left ventricle and the aorta, so it might have been the
      mitral valve. Is it all right?” She says such an absurd thing so normally.
      The peculiarity of her manner of speech catches me off guard, and I smile
      despite myself. “You’re a strange one, aren’t you? If my heart had really
      been cut, then we wouldn’t be able to talk like this, would we?” “Quite
      right. I was only confirming.” I see. She was a friend of the person who
      stabbed me after all, perhaps trying to tie up loose ends on the battle
      that took place in the rooftop. “But it won’t be long until it affects you
      as well. Shiki’s Eyes are potent, perhaps even beyond what that child
      knows. The sympathetic connection between your double existences means
      that the spell will reach you in time. There are a few inquiries I need to
      make, which is why I’m here.” She means the “other” me when she mentions
      the double existence, I’d imagine. “Because I haven’t personally gone to
      the Fujō Tower, I haven’t seen your floating image there,” she continues.
      “What was it really?” “I don’t know, to be honest. For the longest time
      now, the scenery outside the window was the world to me. I looked down on
      the panorama, watching the seasons fly past, and the coming and going of
      people in the hospital. My voice is never heard, and my hands never reach
      anything. And I grew to curse this view as I continued to suffer alone in
      this room.” The woman’s eyebrows crease as she contemplates on something.
      “I see now. So you really are a woman of the Fujō bloodline. Your dynasty
      is an old one, and pure. It’s thought that you and your dynasty granted
      blessings of providence, but now I see that your true abilities lie in
      cursing. The clue was in your name, as Fujō can also mean “defile.” A
      fitting name, don’t you think?” Dynasty. My family. But that too is a
      chapter of my life that’s forever gone. Not long after I was hospitalized,
      both my parents and my brother met an accident and lost their lives. My
      medical expenses have been paid by a man who calls himself my father’s
      friend, a curiously named man that had the air of a monk about him. “But a
      curse is not so easily performed. What was it that you wished for so
      hard?” I can’t help but smile a little bit. Finally, we have something
      that even she doesn’t know about. “Have you known what it is to look down
      on the outside world for so long? To look at such a view for years and
      years, even as your consciousness erodes? I have hated, cursed, and feared
      the outside world for so long now, seeing it all from on high. And one
      day, something happened. It suddenly seemed as if I was in the sky above
      the hospital courtyard, the one outside my window. I could look down on
      everything. My body and mind were still in the room, but I felt my vision
      fly in the sky. But I still couldn’t move from here, and my vision didn’t
      go anywhere beyond this hospital.” “Your mind must have gained
      correspondence with the surroundings, considering how long you’ve been
      here. Your spatial awareness must have been quite strong.” For the second
      time now, she pauses before she says, “Is that the time when you started
      to lose your eyesight?” It seems there is little about me this woman
      doesn’t know even before she entered the room. It’s true, though. I will
      soon be fully blind. I nod my answer. “Yes. I could do nothing as the
      world slowly turned into nothingness. At first, I thought that everything
      was just turning into a deep darkness. But it was the void I was gazing
      into. But this didn’t bother me, because my real eyes were floating high
      up in the sky. I can only see the view around the hospital, but I was
      never going to get out of here anyway. Nothing really changed, if you
      think about it. Nothing ever changed…” I have a short coughing fit. It’s
      been such a long time since I talked to anyone for this long, it hurts my
      throat and lungs, and focusing too much makes my eyes burn. “I see,” she
      replies after I compose myself. “You projected your consciousness in the
      sky. But if that was your consciousness, then you should truly be dead,
      since Shiki killed your ‘ghost’ consciousness.” In truth, I’ve actually
      been thinking that as well. This woman keeps saying the name Shiki, who I
      assume to be my assailant. How was that person able to stab me? The me
      floating in the Fujō Tower can’t touch anything, but also cannot be
      affected in turn. Yet this Shiki slashed me as if that was my real body.
      “Answer me. Was that truly you in the Fujō Tower?” she asks with a tone of
      curiosity laced with the forcefulness that has never left her voice since
      she came inside the room. “It…wasn’t. I only stare at the sky, while she
      exists in it. That other me turned its back on me. Self abandons self.”
      Wording it that way made it seem like more than an affectation. I did
      truly turn my back on the world, as it had abandoned me. And I abandoned
      myself, of any hope that my sickness would get better. Being separated
      from the world outside the window and unable to break through that
      boundary no matter how hard I prayed every night, both me and the other me
      couldn’t put our feet firmly on the ground, and were resigned to an
      ephemeral, fragile existence. We share that similarity, despite parting
      with each other. I suppose it’s what this woman called a “sympathetic
      connection”. She draws a short breath, perhaps in surprise. It’s the first
      time that this person has shown any sort of uncalculated emotion, and it
      surprises me a little. “So it’s not that your consciousness was separated,
      but that you were acting on two vessels with one state of mind. Someone
      else gave you this vessel. It’s unlike any work I’ve seen yet, I
      understand that much.” A small nod before she regards me with a
      frighteningly disappointed look. “But why go through so much just to lure
      children to throw themselves off buildings? Why were you not content with
      just looking at the world?” Ah, those poor, enviable girls. What happened
      to them still saddens me. But I had nothing to do with them. They fell
      because they wanted to. “You used the image of you at the Fujō Tower as
      more of a channel for your will, didn’t you? You reached out to them in
      sleep, in their dreams of flight. And in those dreamscapes, at least one
      or two of them were probably on the verge of awakening to magic, which is
      why you could notice them in the mess of other minds in this city, and why
      you can snare them so easily. But it was you who made them think about
      flying while they were outside of sleep, even as they weren’t really
      ‘awake’. They tried to fly, and they got the natural result of trying to
      do the impossible.” Yes. In the fever dreams, they always fly around me,
      and I thought that we could be friends. But they never noticed me, never
      talked to me, never touched me. All they did was float around like fishes
      without consciousness. I thought that, when they were outside of sleep, in
      the times when they were conscious, they could notice me. That was the
      only way I knew… “You’re trembling, friend. Are you cold?” The woman’s
      voice returns to its previous icy demeanor. I clutch myself as the
      unearthly wind fails to subside, despite the window being closed. “I’d
      like to ask you one more thing. Why yearn so much for the sky of a world
      you so detest?” A difficult question. I answer to the best of my ability.
      “In the sky, you can fly as far as you want, go as far as you can go,
      because it never ends. I thought I could find a world that I didn’t hate,
      and a world that could accept me in turn.” “Did you find that world?” My
      shivering doesn’t subside, the chill acting like invisible hands shaking
      my body. My eyes sear with pain from being focused for so long. I nod yes.
      “Before I sleep every night, I fear that I will not wake up the next day.
      I fear that one day, it will be morning, and my eyes will never open
      again. But it’s also the reason why I feel alive. Strange, isn’t it? My
      hollow shell of a body and poor excuse for a life is always shadowed by
      death, but it’s that shadow which I rely on to keep myself alive.” Yes,
      that’s the reason why I yearn for death more than life. Death is release.
      To fly without end, to go anywhere one wishes…that’s the world I can yearn
      for. “So you took my acquaintance as a companion to your world?” “No. At
      that time, I didn’t know. I was still longing for life, and while doing
      so, I wanted to fly. I thought I could do so if I was with him. Those
      times are long gone now.” “You and Shiki aren’t so different from each
      other. Both of you believe you can find salvation in someone like Kokutō.
      It isn’t wrong to think you can feel alive and be saved by someone else.”
      Kokutō. I see. So this Shiki confronted me to take him back. Even though I
      know now that my savior is also the harbinger of Death, I feel no regrets.
      “He’s still a child. Always looking at the sky. Always so honest. That’s
      why I thought he could take me anywhere if he put his mind to it. I…I
      wanted him to take me away from all of this.” I start to cry, and it
      stings my eyes so much they seem to scream in pain. It’s not really
      because I’m sad. What happiness it could have been had he been able to
      spirit me away! But it will never come true. It was always a far dream.
      But it was such a beautiful dream, and because of that I couldn’t stop the
      tears. In my eternity in this prison, it was the only dream I’ve had in so
      many years, the only delusion I allowed myself. “But Kokutō has no
      interest in the sky. Those who long for the sky are the farthest from it.
      Ironic, isn’t it?” “Yes, it is. People always seem to have the things we
      don’t need. I could never truly fly. Floating was all I could do.” The
      burning in my eyes subsides, a feeling that will probably never happen
      again. The wind’s invisible hands grip my spine and make me tremble even
      more strongly. “I’ve been a burden long enough. This question will have to
      be my last. What are you going to do after this? I can cure the creeping
      pain Shiki gave you through your other vessel, if that is your wish.” I
      don’t answer her, save for shaking my head no. I can’t see for sure, but
      it seems like she’s frowning. “I understand. There are two ways to escape:
      escape without a purpose, and escape with a purpose. I call the former
      ‘floating’, and the latter ‘flight’. You are the only one that decides
      which of the two your view of the world from on high was. But you don’t
      choose these paths because of the weight on your soul. We don’t choose the
      path we take because of the sins we carry. But we carry our sins on the
      path we choose.” After saying her parting words, the woman leaves. She
      never said her name, but I know now that she didn’t need to. I don’t doubt
      for a moment that she knows what I am going to do. Because for me there is
      no choice: I can’t fly. I can only float. I can’t do what she says because
      I’m weak. That’s why I can no longer resist this temptation: The flash of
      realization when I was stabbed in the heart. The overwhelming torrent of
      death and the pulse of life. I thought I no longer had anything left, but
      I was left with such a simple, sweet thing. Death. It was not the
      nonexistent wind, but death, that little fear, that gripped my spine in
      these last moments. I need to experience more of death to feel the joy of
      life, the glory of everything I had ignored in my life until now. But that
      death I experienced on that night, the pain that pierced me like a needle,
      like a sword, like lightning, would be impossible to replicate. I cannot
      hope for such a vivid end now. But I will try to come as close to it as
      much as I can. I still have a few days to think on it, but the method need
      not even be said. I think my last moment should be spent on a high place,
      a place where I can look down on a panorama of the world, and fall back to
      the embrace of the reality that has rejected me so.
