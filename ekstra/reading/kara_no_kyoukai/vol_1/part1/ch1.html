    <h1 class="title">Panorama - I</h1>
    <p>
      Shiki Ryōgi is my friend from high school. We studied together in a
      private school famous for putting a lot of its students on the fast track
      to a college education. On the day that I was looking for my name on the
      lists of people who had passed the entrance exam, I saw a name that caught
      my eye: “Shiki Ryōgi.” As names go, it was a pretty peculiar one, and our
      being classmates ensured that it would get stuck in my head. Ever since
      then, I’ve become possibly the only friend Shiki’s ever had. Due to our
      school having no uniforms, and a casual clothing policy, a lot of people
      dressed in a multitude of ways to express themselves. Even in that sort of
      environment, Shiki stood out from the crowd. Largely because of the
      kimono. At first, that particular wardrobe choice made it seem as if the
      prime minister himself walked in on the classroom, forcing everyone to
      silence. But once it became clear that Shiki wasn’t sparing any words for
      anyone except the queries of the teachers, which were uncommon, people
      started to stop caring. Not that Shiki minded. The cultivated air of
      inapproachability, intentional or not, certainly widened the distance more
      than the clothes already did, but Shiki’s features undoubtedly helped out
      in that regard as well. Black hair framed Shiki’s face, as it does now;
      cut long enough to hide the ears. However, it was clear that the
      maintenance of it seemed to Shiki like it was time wasted, evidenced by
      how it looked like it was cut with reckless abandon. Yet the cut was just
      at that height where people start to second guess Shiki’s gender on first
      contact. More than anything though, it would be Shiki’s eyes that lend
      your feet to stop. Those eyes carried a piercing gaze, seeming to bear
      witness to something invisible, something “other”. To me, those eyes were
      a definition, synecdochic to character. But then, the accident happened…
      “The jumpers.” “Wha—oh, sorry, I wasn’t listening.” Mikiya cocks his head
      towards me a bit to listen. “I said ‘the jumpers.’ As in the people who
      took a header on the sidewalk off a building. Would you say that what
      happened was accidental, Mikiya?” He shuts up for a moment and actually
      tries to think on the casual question seriously. He puts a hand on his
      chin, evoking the puzzled intensity of stumped detectives the world over.
      “Well, it’s on the person who jumps if he really wanted to do that or not.
      As for how society will look at it, they do classify ‘falling from a high
      place’ as an accident so—” “Not a murder, not exactly a suicide, and not
      exactly an accident either. That’s vague,” I muse. “I don’t know if it
      occurred to them that killing themselves would just inconvenience a lot
      more people than they thought it would. Maybe they should have grabbed a
      handbook on the subject and died a bit better.” As soon as I say that, I
      see Mikiya shake his head in disapproval. “I guess I have to add ‘speaks
      ill of the departed’ to your already illustrious résumé of insensitivity.”
      He replies in monotone disappointment, almost without a note of
      chastisement. Typical. “Ah, Kokutō. Ever the killjoy.” Despite my
      objection, he doesn’t even seem to care. “Hah, that’s rare. It’s been a
      while since you called me by that name.” “That so?” He nods like a
      squirrel. I tend to pronounce his surname a bit differently than you would
      normally, with a sort of French flavor; a small joke that originates way
      back in high school. I don’t really like the ring of the nickname though,
      so I stick with “Mikiya” for the most part, but sometimes I just blurt it
      out, like an involunatry emission of boredom or frustration. In the
      silence of my reverie, he suddenly claps his hands as if remembering
      something. “Oh yeah, while we’re on the topic of rare things, I just
      remembered that my sister Azaka said she saw it too.” “Saw what now?” “The
      girl you said you saw floating around the Fujō Tower.” Ah, yes, the Fujō
      Tower, former high-rise condominium situated in the commercial office
      district of town that used to serve as residence to the more privileged
      tax brackets, now abandoned and leaving people with little else save its
      husk and its memory. And a haunting, if what Kokutō says is true. Passing
      by it some days ago, I happened to see a spectral figure in that looked
      quite human. If Azaka saw it too, then it must mean it’s real. My second
      sight, the ability to see these types of events, has its roots (as much as
      one can point out a definitive origin to this weirdness, at least) in one
      event, a point in time that feels simutaneously distant and recent. I was
      in a traffic accident two years ago, and because of that I spent those
      last two years in a coma. After waking from that coma, I began to…see
      things that weren’t there before. Tōko would say that what I’m doing isn’t
      so much “sight” as it is “perception.” In other words, it seems my senses
      have “awakened” to a higher level of perception, but it’s all technical
      magical gobbledygook that I couldn’t care less to understand. “I did see
      it more than a few times, but I haven’t been there lately so I wouldn’t
      know if it’s still there,” I say, as I stretch out my arms. “I don’t know
      why,” says Kokutō, perplexed, “but I pass by there all the time and I
      don’t see anything.” “I’d say it’s because you have one extra pair of eyes
      too many,” I throw back at him. “Erm, I don’t think glasses have anything
      to do with it.” Mikiya is always like this. He’s on a no-nonsense path and
      he’s going to stick to it come hell or high water. Honestly, I think it’s
      his naiveté that makes him not see these…”other” things. Nevertheless,
      these trifling incidents of people flying and falling seem to be set to
      continue. I can’t puzzle out the meaning behind it all, so I ask Mikiya a
      question. “Mikiya, do you know the reason people fly?” He gives a shrug.
      “Wouldn’t know. I mean, I’ve never tried flying before anyway,” he says
      with a yawn. It is a night approaching the end of August, and I decide to
      take a stroll. Despite summer quickly coming to a close, the air usually
      remained warm, which makes the chill running through the air tonight a
      rare and unusual event. The last train has come and gone, and a deathly
      silence has blanketed the city. This dead part of town is largely bereft
      of people, and looked like something foreign. Even the few pedestrians
      present seem fake, unnatural, like they were from some old daguerreotype.
      The whole thing reminds me of he scent of corpses, of grave pallor that
      stretched its damning influence across the city, as unstoppable and
      incurable as a terminal disease. Everything—from the foreboding houses
      with no signs of life or light, to the dimly lit convenience store that
      offers little respite from the darkness—everything feels like all it takes
      is one bad moment to make them all fall down in violent upheaval. The moon
      seems like the last refuge of life, even as my Eyes take in the richness
      of death in all things. This place is no exception, and my eyes hurt
      because of it. It’s sickening. I took a black leather jacket with me when
      I left the house, and now I wear it atop my light blue kimono. The
      kimono’s sleeves get bunched up inside the jacket, and the heat warms my
      body. Even then, it still isn’t hot. Well, not exactly. For me, it’s more
      like it wasn’t cold to begin with. Even in such a deep night like this
      one, you can still encounter a few people making their way on the streets.
      A man with the complete suit-tie-briefcase ensemble hurriedly making his
      way down the lane, his face cast downwards, features hidden by the
      shadows. A loiterer sitting by the light of the vending machine, his head
      swimming in the potent cocktail of alcohol and narcotics. Vagrants hanging
      around the vicinity of the 24-hour convenience store, maybe pondering how
      exactly they’re going to bust it, or just trying to find safety in
      numbers. Who knows what reason these people may find themselves out here
      in the middle of the night, walking dangerous streets? I don’t even know
      my own reasons. I’m just doing what I used to do before. …Two years ago.
      In a different time, I was on the cusp of going into my second year of
      high school. But in that rain-soaked night, I was involved in an
      unfortunate traffic accident. I was brought to the hospital straightaway.
      Apparently, I didn’t receive much in the way of bodily harm; few wounds,
      nothing serious, but nothing much beyond that. If it was really an
      accident, it was a pretty damn clean one, I’d say. On the other hand,
      peculiarly, I did receive serious damage to my brain, through which I
      lapsed into a deep coma. That’s what they told me at least. That night is
      the only time I have trouble even recalling. Because I had little serious
      physical injury, it wasn’t a big stretch for the hospital to keep me
      alive, and my unconscious self grasped and groped for that last sliver of
      life. Statistically speaking, after 6 months, the chances of a coma
      patient coming back are pretty slim, but there are the aberrant cases,
      like myself. The doctors were so surprised at my recovery two months ago;
      it’s as if they saw a corpse rising from the grave. Guess they never
      expected me to pull a Lazarus on them, which I guess clues me in to their
      close to zilch hopes on my case. Though perhaps not equaling their
      exaggerated reactions, I too had a surprise waiting for me. My memories
      became…alien, foreign, like they were coming from the head of a different
      person. Put simply, I’m dissociated from the memories, unable to put stock
      in their validity. It was different than mere amnesia, or a lapse in
      memory. As Tōko would say, there are apparently four systems or steps the
      brain uses with regards to handling memory: encoding, storage, retrieval,
      and recognition. “Encoding” is writing your impressions of an experience
      as information in your brain. “Storage” is actually keeping that
      impression or memory. “Retrieval” is calling back that stored information,
      or in other words, remembering. “Recognition” is confirming whether or not
      that information was the same as what actually happened. If, in any one of
      these steps, there is some sort of failure, then you get memory disorder.
      Depending on which of these steps fail, you get very different cases of
      memory disorder. In my case, however, there isn’t a problem with any of
      these steps. Though I can’t place my memories as my own, “recognition” is
      working because I can identify my memories as my previous experiences.
      Even then, I still couldn’t trust these memories. I had no real feeling
      that I am the Shiki Ryōgi that was. Perhaps it was some other Shiki Ryōgi,
      some other high school student, some other person who had an accident. But
      I’ve seen the documents; I am Shiki Ryōgi. At least that’s what my brain
      tells me Two years of oblivion have reduced me, if not to emptiness, than
      to something that sits closely beside it. It laid waste all that I was
      inside, and severed what connection existed between my memory and
      personality through two years of “living” like a shell, on the boundary of
      emptiness. And though there was precious little drama here compared to
      actual societal rejection, it drives me to worry all the same. All my
      memories are just reflections on the water, and I don’t know whether I’m
      the reflection or the real thing. With these memories, I know how to act
      like the Shiki Ryōgi that my parents and friends knew, but I know it best;
      it’s all just an act, just mimesis. It’s like being a newborn baby: not
      knowing anything and lacking any sort of world experience. Or possibly
      it’s more like not living at all. Still, the memories do help. I mean,
      they make me into a functional human being, after all. I already have the
      emotions people have from experiencing something. It’s not real, hands-on
      experience or anything, but at least it’s there. It results in this weird
      feeling where if I do something, I feel like it’s my first time doing it
      and also feel like I’ve done it a hundred times before. There’s no
      amazement, like a magic trick where you can see the strings in the sleeve.
      And so I continue to play out this strange role. The reason is quite
      simple. Because by doing so, maybe I can return to some semblance of the
      past. Because by doing so, maybe I can figure out why I like walking so
      late at night. I guess, in a way, you could say I’ve fallen in love with
      my previous self. I try to get my bearings in the neighborhood, and I
      realize I’ve walked pretty far, enough to reach the office district of the
      city. Buildings that stood at heights almost similar to each other lined
      the street, looking like soldiers arranged in neat little firing ranks.
      The surface of these buildings are riddled with little glass windows,
      themselves in their own arrangement. The reflection of moonlight as well
      as of the other buildings borne atop their shining surfaces creates a sort
      of shadow world, where monsters and their kind lurked. One shadow stands
      taller than the rest, however. Like a perverse monument, it stands long
      and narrow, with a height that looked like it could reach the moon. The
      Fujō Tower. No lights or signs of life are present in that building.
      Seeing as how it’s two o’ clock in the morning, I really shouldn’t be
      surprised. The coldness of the still night is irregular at this time of
      summer. The bone in my nape creaks from the cold, despite the lack of any
      tangible feeling of a breeze. I decide that it’s just my imagination. As I
      looked up at the towering structure, a black shape flits past my sight,
      almost unnoticeable because of the lack of light. Looking closer, I
      realize it’s a shadow of a human figure, and then I realize it’s not a
      shadow at all. The silhouette of a woman comes floating into view atop the
      building. I didn’t mean that as a turn of phrase though. She literally is
      floating. “Hmph, so you’ve shown yourself today as well, I see.” I say. I
      don’t like her up there, silhouetted against the moonlight. But I can
      hardly do anything about what I can see. And as quickly as I saw her, she
      vanishes, flying as if the moon was her cradle.
