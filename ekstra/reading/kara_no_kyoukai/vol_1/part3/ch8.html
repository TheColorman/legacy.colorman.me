    <p>
      I eventually convince Miss Tōko to at least go out and find Shiki, and so
      we head out in her car. With Broad Bridge being the largest construction
      project that the Asagami’s are involved in, and with plenty of places to
      hide, we conclude that it’s the likeliest location for Fujino to seek
      refuge, and the likeliest place for Shiki to be. Miss Tōko runs red light
      after red light in her off-road buggy, and when we near the bay shoreline
      the bridge comes into view, looking like a giant squeezed and twisted it
      with his hand. Nearing the front entrance, we’re stopped by a security
      guard. Miss Tōko starts to argue with him while Shiki, with bloodstained
      left arm, emerges from the corridor behind the guard. Wordlessly assessing
      the situation in a glance, she braces and delivers a running tackle to the
      guard, dealing him a particularly nasty blow to the head. He is knocked
      out instantly, a victim of Shiki’s particular style of negotiation. She
      greets us. “Yo. Somehow, I thought you’d be here,” Shiki says. Her face is
      pale, whether from the cold rain or the blood loss, I couldn’t say. I had
      a mountain of things to say to her regarding this whole ridiculous hunt,
      but when I see her at the brink of collapsing, I’m at a loss for words. I
      try to extend a hand to support her, but she swats it away with her own.
      “Might as well have finished it with one hand tied behind your back, I
      see,” says Miss Tōko, surprised. Shiki grants her a glare of
      dissatisfaction. “Tōko, that girl had a last surprise. She developed some
      sort of remote viewing spell in the end. That and her other power makes
      for a dangerous combination if left alone.” “Remote viewing? Like scrying
      or clairvoyance? That is bad. She’d be able to hit you with a spell even
      if you were hiding behind cover. Wait—‘if left alone’?” Shiki sighs.
      “Well, her pain insensitivity switched back on at the last moment. Fucking
      unbelievable. Without pain, she just denied me the pleasure of seeing her
      suffering face. So I said to myself, ‘what the hell, why don’t I just kill
      her disease while I’m here’. So I saw the lines on her disease, cut ‘em,
      and here we are. If you hurry and get a hospital on the line, she still
      might make it.” At first I thought I didn’t hear correctly, but the only
      thing I understand is that Shiki didn’t kill Fujino Asagami. I immediately
      pull out my cell phone and dial the number of Fujino’s doctor that Miss
      Tōko gave me, just to make absolutely sure they’ll send out an ambulance.
      I’m not entirely sure they could make it in this storm, but if it comes to
      that, I’d take Fujino to a hospital myself. Luckily, her doctor happily
      replies that he’ll come immediately, saying that he’d been worried about
      the missing Fujino. He might have even been crying while talking to me.
      I’m glad to know she has at least one person on her side in this world.
      Oblivious to my joy, Miss Tōko and Shiki are having another one of their
      odd conversations behind me. “Nice job stemming the bleeding with your
      sleeve,” says Miss Tōko, admiring Shiki’s handiwork. “Yeah, and since it
      can’t be fixed anymore, I killed it too for good measure. Figured since
      you were a puppet maker mage, you’d be able to make an artificial arm.”
      “No problem, but that’s coming out of your paycheck. I always thought you
      looked a bit too normal compared to your Arcane Eyes of Death Perception.
      As an added bonus, I’ll even imbue it with the ability to touch ghosts and
      other things in that state of being.” I wish they’d stop talking about all
      that occult stuff. Gives me the creeps. “They said they’re sending an
      ambulance. It’ll be a lot of trouble if we stay here, so do you wanna go?”
      “With pleasure,” Miss Tōko replies, shivering in the rain. Shiki remains
      silent. I’m hoping the reason for that is that she wants to see Fujino
      Asagami off properly. “I’ll have to stay here, since I’m the one that
      contacted them and have to give them a situation report. Both of you can
      probably go.” “In this miserable rain? You’re a strange one, aren’t you,
      Kokutō?” Miss Tōko gestures for Shiki to follow her. “Shiki, let’s scram.”
      “I’ll pass, thanks.” Shiki replies, which promptly has Miss Tōko smiling
      mischievously at us all the way back to her buggy. “Shiki, make sure not
      to kill Kokutō just because you couldn’t take a shot at Fujino, all
      right?” She starts the car, and though I can’t hear her from here, I see
      her laughing even as she backs it up and drives away. In the shade of a
      nearby building, me and Shiki seek shelter from the summer rain, and
      before long, the ambulance arrives. We watch as the EMTs load Fujino into
      the ambulance. From our distance, I can’t get a good look at Fujino, so I
      can’t confirm whether or not she’s the same girl I met on the night of the
      20th, as I’ve been suspecting. Somehow, I think it’s for the best. Shiki,
      wet and cold from the rain, has her empty eyes fixed intently on Fujino
      Asagami. The night is slowly shifting into dawn, and while listening to
      the sound of the rain, I air a question. “Still can’t forgive her, right?”
      “She’s dead to me. Got no business with the dead,” says Shiki frankly, but
      without malice. So she’s decided she no longer cares. That might actually
      be the best possible result for both their sakes. Shiki throws her glance
      in my direction. “And you? You’re the one that keeps saying that murder is
      bad no matter what the reason, right?” It almost seems as if the question
      is directed as much to herself as to me. “Yeah, but I sympathize with her.
      To be honest, I’m not feeling anything towards the corner boys Fujino
      killed.” “Well, isn’t that surprising. I was hoping I could hear the
      dulcet tones of your familiar generalizations.” I don’t know if Shiki
      wants me to be angry at her or not, but it doesn’t matter. She didn’t kill
      anyone. I close my eyes and try to listen to the sound of the raindrops
      falling. “Well, take it or leave it. I still think that, despite her
      losing her way, she’s still a normal girl. When she looks back on this,
      she won’t be selective about what she chooses to remember. She’ll remember
      what she did, warts and all. And even if she does give herself up, the
      case is absurd. No one can prove she could have done the murders, and she
      won’t be punished by society. But that’s what’ll make it so difficult for
      her.” “How so?” “Because I think sins are things people individually
      carry, a burden that we ourselves make for our own fair share. Our sins
      become heavier the better our wisdom and common sense, and the greater our
      happiness. The same goes for Fujino Asagami.” “Man, this is why we call
      you a big softy. So you’re saying a man without wisdom and compassion
      doesn’t know the weight of sin?” “I suppose. But see, there isn’t a person
      in the world that doesn’t know the weight of a sin. Maybe some people to
      whom the weight of sin is light instead of overbearing, but the weight is
      felt all the same, a small sin in the scope of their similarly small
      compassion, but enough to plant the doubt in him. And soon enough, that
      doubt grows into something they regret. Though the size differs for each
      person, each sin carries the same purpose.” Even for Keita Minato, whose
      fear of his own sins almost drove him to madness. He has fear and anger,
      but also regret and guilt. He might never be able to atone, but he can
      try, at the very least. “It certainly seems easier to not be blamed by
      society for your own sins, but if no one will judge you, then you carry it
      yourself. The memories never let the seed go away. You yourself believe
      that the soul doesn’t exist, Shiki. Guess that means that you can’t heal
      the wounds in it either.” I conclude with a smile. “And if no one forgives
      you, you can’t even begin to forgive yourself. The wound in your soul only
      keeps growing, never healing, like Fujino’s lingering pain.” In a rare
      show of contemplative demeanor, Shiki remains silent and actually listens.
      Without prior warning, she steps out of the shade of the building roof and
      lets herself be washed over by the rain. “Alright, Mikiya the Poet. You
      say there are no truly bad people, since compassion and wisdom always
      makes them remember their sins. But what about me, who, need I remind you,
      isn’t particularly compassionate or wise. Can you let a person like me run
      free?” “Well, there’s no curing stupidity. Guess I’ll have to carry your
      sins in your place,” I say earnestly. Shiki glances at me blankly, looking
      very much surprised before casting her eyes downwards. “Now I remember.
      You always used to joke with a straight face back in the day. I swear, was
      terribly annoyed at that.” “Well, I think I can carry the sins of at least
      one girl with me,” I argue. In a rare show of humor, Shiki chuckles. “I’ll
      tell you one more thing,” she adds. “I might have burdened myself with a
      sin today. But in return, I found out how I wanted to live, and what I
      want. It’s vague and fragile, but for now, it’s all I got. And it turns
      out it’s not as bad as I thought it would be, and that makes me just a
      little happy. It’s a little, teensy, weensy bit…of homicidal intent that’s
      leaning in your direction.” That last sentence makes me grimace a little,
      and yet Shiki still looks beautiful smiling under the rain. The storm is
      already subsiding, and by morning it will all probably be over. Me and
      Shiki spend just a few more precious moments there alone, Shiki, smiling,
      letting the summer rain wash over her like a salve of forgiveness, and me
      just looking at her. It is the first real smile she showed me since she
      woke up less than a month ago.
