    <p>
      I arrive at Miss Tōko’s office to find Shiki there as well. Me bringing an
      outsider into Miss Tōko’s office quickly sends her into a panic, but I
      explain the situation as fast as I can, and she begrudgingly accepts Keita
      Minato’s plea for shelter. She takes him to her bedroom to let him sleep
      on a sofa, and returns quickly to the office room where me and Shiki
      waited, me sitting in the office room couch and Shiki leaning with her
      back to a wall. Both of us say nothing until Miss Tōko is seated on her
      own chair. Then, almost as if they had planned to beforehand, they say in
      unison: “You big softy.” “Yeah, I knew something like that was coming my
      way,” I reply. “If you knew, then you should have had some second thoughts
      about getting involved. You are such an easy mark for these people.”
      “Well, what did you expect me to do, ma’am, leave someone to die? You know
      the circumstances.” Miss Tōko only responds with a curt wave of dismissal.
      She might be a bit annoyed, but I know her well enough to say that she’s
      not the kind of person who callously throws away an opportunity to help a
      person in real need. Keita would surely be safe here, under Miss Tōko’s
      many means of protection, and if I had to suffer her mild disappointment,
      then so be it. Shiki is a different story, however. She’d objected
      vehemently earlier when I brought Keita in, saying that this would only
      complicate matters, but Miss Tōko had overruled her. I can practically
      feel the angry eyefuck she’s throwing my way. “Well, this is a special
      case, considering the circumstances,” Miss Tōko says. “What do you plan on
      doing now? Don’t tell me you’re going out to find Fujino Asagami and try
      to persuade her.” “Realistically speaking, we can’t hide Keita Minato
      forever,” I reply. “Fujino Asagami won’t stop the murders until he finds
      her, and that’s unacceptable. I think the best course of action now would
      be to meet with her and talk things over.” At this, Shiki finally talks.
      “You know the reason we say you’re an easy mark? This is pretty much it.
      You’re living in fantasy land if you think that’s going to work.” While
      Shiki has never been one to massage her words when she felt the need to
      talk, she was being especially antagonistic today. She really must be
      angry at me. “You’re not gonna get through to her head, I’m telling you,”
      she continues. “That girl’s too far gone. She won’t stop even if she does
      get to Keita. He’s just an excuse to keep killing at this point, and when
      she’s done with him, she’ll find another excuse just as convenient.”
      “Yeah, right, as if you know her.” “Oh, but I do, and met her to boot.
      Azaka brought her along to Ahnenerbe yesterday.” That catches me by
      surprise. How would Azaka know Fujino? The people I talked to placed her
      around or above high school age, so it’s possible she could be studying at
      Reien Girl’s Academy. Wait a minute— “It’s a bit of a surprise that you’re
      behind on this one, Kokutō,” Miss Tōko declares. “You still haven’t made
      any inquiries about Fujino Asagami?” “I hope you’ll excuse me for not
      looking into a person I just heard of not two hours ago, ma’am. I can’t
      very well drag a person with me around town while a known killer is
      looking for him.” Something bothers me, and not just because Azaka keeps
      terrible company and could have been involved, but something else, like
      when you keep remembering something you want so hard to put out of your
      mind. “So does this mean that she’s still going to school?” I ask. “Why
      don’t we just ask the school?” “No, that’s a dead end. She started cutting
      classes and not going home since the night of the incident. She’s a
      wanderer now. I called Azaka up and she says she hasn’t seen her since the
      day they met.” “Wait. When did you check that out, Miss Tōko?” “A little
      while ago. When Shiki told me last night that Fujino was with Azaka, I
      called her right away, but it seems she didn’t notice anything was out of
      place with her friend.” The mention of Azaka and Fujino in the café again
      makes me think in hindsight. Maybe if I had promised to meet Azaka a day
      later, or if I’d found Keita a day earlier, a meaningless murder might
      have been avoided. “That said, Keita Minato’s presence here isn’t totally
      useless to us,” says Miss Tōko. “We can just use him as bait to lure her
      out. It might turn violent after that, so I’d advise you to stay here with
      Keita.” “Wait, what’s going on? Why are you so interested in Fujino
      Asagami anyway? And what do you mean ‘violent’? What are the both of you
      planning?” Miss Tōko exhales a sharp sigh and replies. “We might have to
      fight her, if the circumstances dictate it. The truth, Kokutō, is that we
      have a new job, and the client wants Fujino killed, silently and with no
      mess. And so our job is to kill her before it all becomes public.” Wait,
      hold on a second! It’s not like she’s killing indiscriminately! She can
      still be reasoned with,” I reply abruptly. Now I finally understand why
      Miss Tōko took Shiki under her employ. She has use for her talents, and
      this is it. “There’s one thing you don’t know yet, Kokutō, something that
      makes that a difficult course of action. Right before I put Keita Minato
      to sleep, I made him tell me the whole story. The ringleader of their
      little crew apparently brought a knife that fateful night, and she stabbed
      Fujino with it deep. Keita said that was the exact moment she made with
      the twisting. That’s when her revenge started.” “But I don’t see how that
      could be reason that she’s beyond negotiating with.” “The problem stems
      from that point, however. Fujino was stabbed on the stomach the night of
      the 20th.” “Stabbed in the stomach…” I mutter out of hearing of both Shiki
      and Miss Tōko. Now I connect the dots. The night of the 20th, a student of
      Reien Girl’s Academy, and a stab wound in the stomach. I try my damndest
      to reach a different conclusion, but it’s useless. That’s where it all
      points to. “According to Keita, she keeps calling him, saying that the
      pain from the wound is what drives her forward. Any wound that produces
      that much pain is bound to be obvious. You’d look paler from blood loss,
      your gait would change from trying to accommodate the pain, things of that
      nature. But when both Azaka and Shiki met her only two days from the night
      when she was supposedly stabbed, none of them observed anything out of the
      ordinary about her. I don’t know how but it seems like she’s made a full
      recovery. Here’s my theory: every time she remembers being raped, the pain
      from her stab wound returns. It’s just a phantom pain, the wound being
      long gone, but to her it’s every bit as real and painful as that night.
      And every time she feels the pain, she kills another. Who’s to say that
      won’t happen if you happen to be talking to her?” But at the same time,
      doesn’t that mean that if we can get rid of her phantom pain, then we can
      talk to her? Before I can say this, however, Shiki offers her own
      observations. “You’re wrong, Tōko. Her pain is real, and it’s still in her
      body.” “But how could that be? Are you retracting what you said about her
      being unwounded?” “Not really. Her stab wound’s completely healed, that
      much we can be sure of. But, fact remains that she’s still in pain. Now
      I’m not saying she’s got a rusty metal rebar stuck in her intestines or
      anything like that. It’s just that, to my observation, her pain flares up
      and disappears on occasion. I saw her when she was in pain, and she was
      holding her sides like you would if you were stabbed, and that point she’s
      beyond any reasoning. But then I also saw her pain disappear, as if she
      just completely forgot about it, and at that point she just bores me. I
      can’t enjoy killing her like that, so I just let her go.” “Okay, Shiki,
      first off, she wouldn’t even last a day with a rebar in her intestines.”
      Miss Tōko comments. “A wound that keeps hurting…even after it’s completely
      healed, huh?” she muses, slowly and pensively. She takes out a cigarette,
      her favored companion when thinking things over hard. I, too, am puzzled
      by Shiki’s observation of Fujino Asagami. It’s natural for a wound to hurt
      until it heals, but why would a wound that’s completely healed suddenly
      come back from time to time? It’s almost like she could dull her nerves
      and stay the pain, making it linger. And then I suddenly remember the
      little trivial detail in Keita Minato’s bizarre story, when I asked him
      what was so weird about her. It isn’t an answer to her condition, but
      anything helps at this point. The recollection comes so suddenly that I
      shout an “Oh!” unintentionally. “’O’ was always my favorite vowel. It’s
      very well-rounded,” says Shiki in response. “Very funny, Shiki. Actually,
      I remembered something Keita told me that might be related.” Miss Tōko
      looks at me with an eyebrow cocked, curious now. “He told me that they did
      all sorts of things to her, including beating her to within an inch of her
      life, and she wouldn’t so much as make a frown. At first, when Keita told
      me this, I thought that she was just a really strong girl and that she
      just didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of knowing that they
      angered her. But now I realize that isn’t it at all.” “Oh, yeah right, as
      if you know her,” says Shiki sarcastically in a mockery of my voice while
      looking sharply in my direction. “Sound familiar?” “Okay, fine, maybe I
      don’t know her, but isn’t there a sickness that makes you insensitive to
      pain? Maybe she could have one of those. I know it’s a rare condition, but
      that would explain all of this.” “It would explain some things,” Miss Tōko
      agrees, “but not all. If she was really insensitive to pain, then the
      wound wouldn’t really hurt. That’s not the way Keita described it, though.
      At any rate, we’d need to investigate it for sure; whether or not it was
      congenital and things like that. Well, assuming she is insensitive to
      pain, then was there anything that could have changed that? I’m talking
      about things that mess up your nerves like being whacked hard in the back
      or getting a large dose of steroids in the neck.” “A hit on the back?
      Well, I don’t really know how hard it was, but Keita told me one of his
      friends took a metal bat and swung it at her back at one point.” I try to
      restrain my voice to hold back how angry the whole story made me. Miss
      Tōko emits a strange laugh. “You know what? That could actually be it. The
      way you and Keita describe these guys, it’s likely they fractured her back
      bone and that somehow jolted her nervous system back into working
      condition. Then, with Fujino still disoriented as to what that new
      sensation was, they violated her. So her first experience of pain was a
      confused flavor of blunt force trauma and rape. Knowing this, I’m
      surprised you even sought shelter for Keita Minato. I’d have left him to
      die on the spot,” Miss Tōko says with a grin. Normally, I’d have opposed
      her attempts at verbally annoying me, but I’m too worn out in thinking
      about this bizarre case to offer her any more coherent a counter to it
      than to hang my head and focus my eyes intently on the floor. “So, do her
      back bone and her insensitivity to pain have any relation?” I ask. “There
      certainly is. The spinal cord is a conduit for all sensations. Problems
      that lead to pain insensitivity, such as syringomyelia, usually originate
      in the spine. Now let me paint a scenario for you. See, there are two
      types of senses: your superficial sense is what you feel outside, such as
      touch, pain, and temperature. Deep sensation is pain, pressure, and
      tension felt inside. Now, can you describe to me what it would be like if
      you had no sensation whatsoever?” “I guess it’d be like if you can’t feel
      what you touch and can’t taste any food, right?” Miss Tōko nods her head
      and smiles, clearly enjoying this exercise. “Exactly the sort of answer
      someone used to sensation would give. We think that because that just
      because they still have bodies, that their experience is largely the same
      as ours, if perhaps less visceral. But that couldn’t be farther from the
      truth. Understand, Kokutō, that to have no sensation is to lack the
      ability to truly assimilate experience.” I don’t really understand. I
      mean, she can still hold things and talk to people. It’s just that when
      she touches something, it’s probably a less visceral experience, right?
      Why wouldn’t she be able to assimilate experience? It’s not like she
      doesn’t have a body. I’d think it’d be worse to have a part of your body
      cut off, in fact. It’s then that I realize it. She doesn’t have a body. Or
      at least, it’s something close to it as to be indistinguishable. She feels
      nothing. The only way to prove to herself that she’s touching anything is
      to look at her hands. It’s the same as reading a book, lacking the tactile
      sensation of the characters. Running, for her, is just like moving the
      point of view in a camera in some movie. She doesn’t feel the soil on her
      feet, or the sharp, sometimes painful, rebounding of force, or the wind on
      her skin, or the wild pain on your muscles as your heart struggles to pump
      blood. Only her eyes say that she’s running at all. That’s what having no
      sensation is like: to be without a body, as if you’re ethereal, floating
      like a ghost; to not feel alive. “Seeing is believing” is doubly
      applicable to someone like her. “That’s…pain insensitivity, huh?” The
      words almost eave my mouth in a shiver, so shaken am I by the thought.
      “Now you’re catching on,” Miss Tōko says, as if she’s been reading my
      mind. Knowing her, I wouldn’t put it past her. “Now, assuming that Fujino
      Asagami was temporarily cured of this affliction when she was struck
      across the back with a metal bat, then that would have been her first
      experience of pain. Her instinct might have been to lash out. How ironic
      that her return to sensation transformed her into a killer.” “To me, the
      worst thing that Keita and his friends did is that Fujino now equates the
      pain to living since it’s her first and only sensation so far. So she’s
      out there, right now, seeking more and more pain because it makes her feel
      alive. They’ve irreparably damaged her soul,” I say. Without waiting for
      Miss Tōko, Shiki offers a disparaging laugh as a retort. “Oh, please, her
      soul? Can we not go there?” I admit, in my mind, that perhaps I put it a
      bit too poetic and sentimental, especially for this crowd. I don’t think I
      have an answer that can satisfy Shiki, but fortunately Miss Tōko does.
      “Come now, Shiki. Surely you’ve heard of those incidents where people die
      from mental stress. It might be true, it might not be, but if it’s true
      for the person, then it can be hurt as surely as you can stab a person’s
      hand.” Shiki, looking even more sullen than before, folds her arms across
      her chest. “Oh, so now you’re with Mikiya here on how to handle Fujino
      Asagami? Is no one hearing me when I say that she is a walking bomb
      waiting to explode?” “Keep your hat on, Shiki, I’m still with you on that
      score.” After saying that, she turns back to me again. “Listen, Kokutō.
      What I’m thinking is that she’s never come to love or hate anything
      precisely because she can’t feel anything. I’ve already told you how
      different she sees the world from us. It might not be wise to apply common
      sense to her. The unfortunate circumstances of her recovery combined with
      the abilities it gave her compel us to use haste in this situation. It’s
      unfortunate, and I understand your hesitation, but that’s what it is.”
      That last sentence rung out like a final declaration. “Please don’t talk
      like that when you haven’t even met her.” Unable to stand being here any
      longer, I stand up. “I could say the same to you,” she parries. “We’re all
      assuming that her insensitivity to pain was there from birth. What if that
      isn’t the case?” “You’re the one that brought it up,” Miss Tōko says,
      without a hint of rebuke on her voice. How could she be so indifferent to
      Fujino Asagami’s plight? “Actually, now that I think about it, there could
      be certain scenarios where Fujino would be the victim. The question is
      which was first?” I wanted to ask Miss Tōko what she meant by that, but
      she spoke it in a murmur, so I probably misheard it anyway. “Mmm…I’m not
      sure. What do you think, Shiki?” asks Miss Tōko to the girl who now has
      her back turned on the two of us. “I’ll go with whatever you come up with.
      I don’t care either way. I just want to take Fujino out. The thought of
      her killing another person makes me sick.” “No honor among murderers, huh?
      I guess your kind really can’t tolerate each other.” I decide to be on my
      way to get a head start on this case. “So I guess I’ll follow the paper
      trail on Fujino Asagami. My own way if I have to. Can I see anything
      you’ve got on her?” Miss Tōko hands me her file. I can see that her
      surname changed from “Asakami” to “Asagami”, roughly around the time she
      entered junior high. Her mother remarried, meaning her father right now
      isn’t her real one. She also lived in Nagano Prefecture during elementary
      school, before she moved when entering junior high. I guess that’s as good
      a place as any to start. “I’m gonna be gone for some time. I might not be
      back tomorrow. Is that alright, Miss Tōko?” “No problem. You’re part of
      the job now after all.” I had one last question to her, one that had been
      bugging me since Keita told me about it. “Miss Tōko, what Keita said,
      about Fujino being able to move things with her mind; is that
      parapsychology stuff true?” “I’m surprised you’re still a doubter at this
      point when you have me and Shiki right here. One look at that murder scene
      should tell you that Fujino has powers of some sort. The term
      parapsychology encompasses a lot of subjects, so if you want to learn more
      about it, I can point you to the closest thing to an expert.” With that,
      she takes one of her business cards and writes the address of this
      “expert” on the back. “So you don’t know anything about it?” “No. We mages
      study the Art of magic as a discipline, but what she has is a result of
      the lineage and upbringing of her dynasty, one that has been kept secret
      from mages, and thus, one that has no field of study or history apart from
      their own. She’s the kind of magic user I hate: one that got her power
      from a petty dynasty scrapping together what little potential they can
      muster in their magical lineage, with no training in the responsibilities
      it implies. Unlike better men, she didn’t deserve it.” Her last sentence
      was surely no lie, as it was said with her glasses on, the time where she
      is least deceptive. I take Miss Tōko’s business card, and then approach
      Shiki, who’s been whiling away the time by looking outside the window.
      “Well, see you later, I guess. Don’t get reckless while I’m gone.” “You’re
      the one being reckless here. Shame there’s no cure for stupidity,” she
      snaps back. She nods, though, and grumbles an “I’ll try,” almost silently.
      With that, I leave the office, relieved a little bit at Shiki’s
      reassurance. She’s been quite agitated to go after Fujino Asagami, and I
      suppose I can understand why. I hope it doesn’t come to violence, but if
      it does, and they fight, I wonder if Shiki will finally realize that she’s
      never liked murder. She and Fujino Asagami are more alike than even the
      both of them realize. As for my own safety, well, I’m gonna have to say
      I’ve got great odds. I’ve only tempted death once. Shiki’s forgotten all
      about that incident ever since she woke up from the coma, but it’s
      probably better that she doesn’t know. I haven’t told her that she’s the
      one that almost killed me. I probably never will. It is the 24th of July,
      a day after Mikiya Kokutō went out of town to follow the paper trail on
      Fujino Asagami’s past, and it is a day that has so far proven to be, by
      all estimation, rather uneventful. The only really newsworthy stories for
      the day are an incoming wallop of a storm predicted to make landfall this
      evening, and a traffic accident involving a seventeen-year old driving
      without a license. Shiki Ryōgi whiles away the lazy morning hours by
      staring outside the window of Tōko Aozaki’s office. Her eyes are fixed on
      the sky, so blue and cloudless today, with the sun alone being it’s only
      noticeable feature. It seems almost a bad joke that this otherwise
      stereotypical summer day would soon be disturbed by an invasion of storm
      clouds. The soundscape is less than idyllic however, as the noise of heavy
      machinery from the iron factory a few blocks down rings in Shiki’s ears
      without any sign of letting up. She glances at Tōko, somewhat impressed at
      how she can still conduct the telephone conversation she’s in right now
      without any hint of distraction. With her glasses on, and the receiver in
      her ear, she spouts a steady stream of words. “Yes, I’m inquiring about
      the accident…I see, so the driver had already died before the
      collision...his head twisted off?...well, with no passengers in the
      vehicle it does seem like an accident…that’s quite alright. Any detective
      would have a hard time with a moving sealed room case, after all…oh, thank
      you, but that’s all I needed to ask. I must apologize for bothering you
      like this detective Akimi. I’ll make it up to you somehow.” Tōko on the
      phone with her glasses on is a show of politeness, a far cry from her
      usual harsh tones. After hanging up the phone, she adjusts her glasses
      just a pinch to lie below her eyes, enough to say that they no longer
      cover them. “That’d be the seventh now, Shiki. She’s definitely taken the
      lead from the serial killer two years ago.” Shiki moves away from the
      window towards Tōko’s desk. A shame. She’d wanted to see the storm clouds
      gather in the sky. “Can’t say I didn’t warn you,” Shiki states bluntly.
      “Now she’s killing people that she doesn’t even know.” “Seems that way.
      This ‘Shōichi Takaki’ fellow”, she says—the name of Fujino’s latest
      victim—“seems unconnected to Keita Minato as well. This is a murder
      unrelated to her so-called revenge.” Shiki grinds her teeth in impatience.
      She grabs her red leather jacket and dons it over her white kimono in a
      single, rough motion. “If that’s the case, then I’m sure as hell not
      sitting around here. Any ideas where I can start looking for her, Tōko?”
      “No clue. I can figure two, maybe three areas where she could be hiding.
      If you’re going to try and find her, you’re just going to have to hit all
      of them.” She produces three small cards from her desk drawer and tosses
      them to Shiki, who catches them out of the air. Shiki gives them a quick
      once-over. “ID cards from Asagami Construction? Who’s this ‘Sōren Alaya’
      character?” The cards each have a magstripe on them, indicating they’re
      used for identification. “Those’ll get you into the construction sites
      that Asagami Construction currently have their hands in. The name’s from a
      long gone friend, since I couldn’t think up a random name at the time I
      had those made, but never mind that. Fujino Asagami must be hiding in a
      place she thinks is secure, and there’s nothing more secure than the
      family business. She’s got cards like that too, I imagine, to sneak into
      the places at night. If she’s hiding anywhere, it’s probably going to be
      in those places. This is going to mean trouble, so if you’re going to do
      it, do it before Kokutō comes back.” Shiki glares at Tōko, her normally
      empty eyes now giving the mage a piercing look. It is a wordless objection
      at the last advice she chose to impart, but in the end Shiki turns around
      to leave. She’ll follow Tōko’s lead on this one, even if that means
      leaving Mikiya in the dark. Shiki leaves the office in no particular
      hurry, the gentle clacking echo of her boots audible even after she walks
      out of the door. As the little footsteps fade, it is now Tōko’s turn to
      look out the window. “Kokutō’s too late on this one, huh?” the mage
      murmurs to herself. “Two storms out there tonight, and I don’t know which
      of them will come and which of them will break first. might not last the
      night alone, Ryōgi.”Past noon, the weather starts to take a turn for the
      worse when dull, ash-colored clouds slowly begin to creep along the sky.
      The wind is picking up as well, and the people on the streets quicken
      their paces, all of them seem to be talking about a coming storm. While I
      walk, burning pain shoots through my abdomen even as I clutch it tighter.
      Preoccupied as I was with my hunt for Keita Minato’s friends, I heard no
      news about the storm. It will make it difficult to search, so I decide to
      call it off for tonight. I spend the last, fleeting hours of the afternoon
      making my way across town to the port, and I see the city slowly lower its
      tempo over the hours, and the volume of people steadily decrease. Though
      it is only 7:00 in the evening in summertime, the sky had long since
      become dark. Even the seasons grow mad at the coming of the storm. My body
      shares the sentiment, as it continues to become sluggish and my reactions
      become slower with each passing day. With effort, I finally arrive at the
      Broad Bridge, Father’s pet project, which bridges this coast and the one
      across the bay. With four lanes on either side and passages and walkways
      for people underneath, it is quite the structure. The “basement” is a
      shopping mall. The main entryway into the bridge is guarded, but I know
      the same isn’t true for the shopping mall entrance. Having made my way
      there, I take one of the cards that I stole from the manor, and swipe it
      through the receiver. The door opens welcomingly to a dark passageway. The
      structure and the interior design of the mall had already been finished,
      but the lights were yet to be connected, making the entire thing look like
      a subway station about to close up for the day. The lack of light made the
      mall promenade stretch onward for what seemed like an interminable
      distance, with shops of various products flanking it. After walking about
      five hundred meters, however, the surroundings abruptly change, indicating
      that I had reached the parking lot. The wall that divided it and the mall
      was unfinished, so I didn’t notice it. As a matter of fact, the entire
      parking lot was still under construction. The iron rebars on the walls,
      exposed as they are like a person’s bones, make the entire structure look
      fragile. Some of the wall sections are, as yet, unbuilt, making the room
      exposed to the outside if not for the simple tarpaulin covering the
      breaches. It’s been an hour since I entered the bridge interior, and the
      storm is already raging. The howling wind is especially audible here in
      the parking lot, where the violent flapping of the canvas, the roar of the
      waves, and the pitter-patter of the raindrops like machine gun fire
      combine to make a cacophony I can barely endure. It was raining that day
      too, on the night of my first murder. I let the warm raindrops wash over
      me and watched as the dirt, the grime, and the slick blood trickled from
      my hands. And then I met him, the man who I had last met in junior high,
      who had shared with me only a single conversation. No other memory do I
      treasure more than the day I first met him, when the horizon looked almost
      ablaze in the sunset. A cross-school event had only just finished, and I
      was still in the school playing field because of a sprained ankle. Not
      being able to feel pain, I could try to move, but I saw how swollen my
      ankle already was, and if I tried to push it any further, I knew it would
      get to the point where I would damage it beyond recovery. And I didn’t
      want to call out for help, either, because they would all ask me the same
      questions, asking me about the pain I didn’t feel, like I’m some sort of
      attraction. So I just sat there, alone, staring at the setting sun with a
      vaguely disinterested expression on my face, praying that no one would
      notice. No one should ever notice. Not mother, not father, not my
      teachers, not my friends, no one. I need to be the Fujino that they
      wanted, the Fujino that was normal. Somebody tapped me on the shoulder. I
      never felt it, but I heard his hand land close to my ear. I turned around
      and there he stood; an upperclassman from another school. His unassuming
      eyes are of someone refreshingly ignorant of my condition, and yet, on
      that first time I met him, I think I must have hated him for bothering me.
      “Does it hurt?” he said, and I dreaded what would come next. The
      curiosity. The prying. The false praise that implied fear and disbelief. I
      shook my head no. He glanced at the name tag on my PE uniform, examined my
      sprained ankle briefly, and then finally frowned at me. I knew that he was
      going to ask something I didn’t like next, so I just closed my eyes,
      determined to just ignore the thoughtless questions that were going to
      come from someone normal. I didn’t want to hear them. But instead, he said
      something altogether different. “Not too bright, are we? Listen, you’re
      not supposed to hold the pain inside, but show it outside. That way,
      people can help you, little Fujino.” He carried me to the nurse’s office
      without so much as a complaint, and there we parted ways. I might have
      fallen for him then, for how he worried about me and my suffering like no
      one else did. It’s a memory that seems more and more like a faint dream
      with each throb of the pain. The same pain that now brings me back to
      reality, and dispels the thought from my mind like melting ice. It almost
      feels as if I’m not…worthy to even remember it, sullied as my hands are in
      the blood of many people. But the rain has helped me before, like holy
      water absolving me of sin, and there is no better rain than the one this
      huge storm brings. I drag my slowing body to the parking lot ramp leading
      to the upper portion of the bridge, yearning for the sweet sensation of
      the summer rain on my skin.
