    <h1 class="title">Lingering Pain - I</h1>
    <p>
      July is about to end, but not before it dumps a lot of business in my
      plate. Starting from my friend who, comatose for two years, has finally
      regained consciousness, to finishing my second big job since dropping out
      of college and working for Miss Tōko, and even having my sister who I
      haven’t seen for five years coming here to Tokyo for a visit, I’ve had
      little time to even stop and take a breath. I don’t know if starting my
      nineteenth summer like this is the good earth’s way of saying “nice job”
      or “Mikiya Kokutō needs to be screwed over with greater frequency.”
      Tonight is one of those rarest of nights, my night off, so I went with
      some of my old high school friends to go drinking. And before I could so
      much as glance at an hour hand, I’d noticed it was late and the train had
      long since made its last run, leaving me with few commuting options to go
      back home. Some of my friends took taxis home, but since my payday was
      held off till tomorrow, my budget can’t cooperate. Left without a choice,
      I decided to walk back home. Fortunately, my house was only two stations
      and a block or two away, not too far a distance. It was the 20th of July
      up until a few minutes ago. In the midnight of the 21st, I find myself
      walking in the shopping district, which, seeing as tomorrow is a weekday,
      sees little foot traffic at this hour. It had rained particularly hard
      tonight. Luckily, it stopped just as me and my friends were going home for
      the evening, but the asphalt, still wet, is emitting its potent petrichor
      smell, and my footsteps make little splashes on the scattered puddles of
      the streets and sidewalks. While the above 30 degree Celsius temperature
      and the humidity of the rain work to make this the most miserable stroll
      in recent memory, I come across a girl, crouching on the sidewalk and
      putting pressure on her stomach with her hand like she was in pain. That
      black school uniform she’s wearing is one I’m familiar with. The uniform,
      made to resemble a nun’s habit, is the school dress of that academy of
      ladies of refined taste and upright morals, the Reien Girl’s Academy.
      Gakuto jokes that half the reason for Reien’s popularity is precisely
      because of the uniform. Not that I’m one that goes in for that kind of
      thing; I only know it because my sister Azaka studies there. I know
      they’re a boarding school, though, which makes that girl’s presence here
      at this late hour doubly suspicious. Or maybe she’s just some delinquent
      that doesn’t like to follow school regulations. Seeing as she’s from my
      sister’s school, I decide to lend a helping hand. When I call out a simple
      “hello” to her, she turns to face me, and her black hair, wet from the
      rain, sways when she does. I see her gasp once, though quite silently, as
      if trying to suppress it. Her face is small, with sharp features. She
      wears her long hair straight down her back, and it separates around her
      right ear to form a tassel that goes down to her chest. It seems there is
      supposed to be a similar tassel on her left ear but it looks like it’s
      been cut. That, along with her bangs, cut straight and clean in the school
      prescribed manner, makes me think she’s the daughter of some rich,
      well-to-do family with an eye for proper grooming standards. “Yes, what is
      it?” Her voice is faint and her face is equally pale. Her lips are tinted
      purple, the mark of someone with cyanosis. With a hand on her stomach,
      she’s trying her best to look at me normally, but the little muscle
      movements and the folds in the face that mark a person in pain are
      obvious. “Does your stomach hurt?” “No, er…that is, I…I mean…” She’s
      pretending to be calm, but she’s already stumbling all over her words. She
      looks fragile, like she could suffer from a mental break down at any
      moment, not unlike Shiki when I first met her. “You’re a long way away
      from Reien Academy, lady. Miss the train? I could call a taxi for you.”
      “No, you don’t need to. I don’t have any money anyway.” “Yeah, join the
      club.” Before I’d realized it, I’d already given her an impolite answer.
      Try to salvage this one, Mikiya. “Yeah…so I guess you must live near here
      huh? I heard it was a boarding school but you probably have some special
      dispensation to go out.” “Not really. My house is quite far.” Right.
      Scratch that. “So what are you, a runaway?” “Yes, I think that’s the only
      thing I can do right now.” Oh, man, that means trouble. I just noticed
      that she’s soaked right through. Maybe she couldn’t find an umbrella or a
      shade the whole time it rained, because she is dripping wet all over. The
      last time I was face to face with a girl soaking wet in rain, I almost got
      killed, so I guess that’s why I’m so awkward around this girl now. You
      never can trust girls in rain. Still, it’ll be a waste of time if I don’t
      help her now. “So, you want to sleep over at my place just for tonight?”
      “…can I?” she asks, still crouching and looking desperately at me. I nod.
      “I have a place all to myself, but I’m not making you any guarantees. I’m
      not planning on doing anything questionable that might offend your person,
      and as long as you don’t do any funny business, we can keep it that way.
      If that’s fine with you, then you can follow me. Now, since my employer,
      in her infinite wisdom, has decided to delay my paycheck, I can’t give you
      much money, but I do have painkillers for whatever’s bothering you.” She
      looks happy and smiles. I extend a hand to her to help her up, and she
      gently grasps it and stands. I notice, for a moment, that there are red
      stains on the sidewalk where she was sitting. Taking her with me, I start
      to lead her back to my apartment and get us both out of this wretched
      night. “There’s a short walk ahead of us. Tell me if you’re having a hard
      time. I can at least be burdened with one girl on my back.” “You needn’t
      worry. My wound has already closed up so it doesn’t really hurt anymore,”
      she says. The hand that she has yet to remove from pressing on her
      stomach, however, says otherwise. “Does your stomach hurt?” I ask again,
      as much for her own peace of mind as mine. She shakes her head, saying
      “no.” After that, we continue to walk, and she keeps her silence for some
      time. But after walking for a few more minutes, she nods. “Yes, it…it
      really hurts. Is it…all right for me to cry?” When I nod an affirmative,
      her face turns into an expression of contentment. She closes her eyes,
      looking like she’s dreaming. She hasn’t really told me her name, and I
      haven’t told her mine, and I feel it’s more appropriate that it stay that
      way. As soon as we reach the apartment, the girl asks me if she can use
      the shower, to which I say yes. She also wants to dry her clothes, so with
      the lame excuse of buying a pack of smokes, I vacate myself from the
      premises for an hour to give her some time. Man, and I don’t even smoke
      the damn things. After an hour, I come back to find her already exploiting
      the living room sofa by sleeping on it. With all indications pointing to
      tons of work tomorrow, I decide to make good what little time I have left
      for sleep. I set my alarm clock to 7:30am, and I’m off to bed. Before
      falling asleep, I take one last look on her uniform, and can’t help
      noticing it has the littlest of tears, just around her midsection. I wake
      up the next morning to find her sitting in the living room doing nothing.
      Apparently she was waiting for me to get up. Once she sees me awake, she
      gives a quick bow. “Thank you for what you did last night. I don’t have
      any way to repay you, but I can at least thank you.” She stands up and
      makes for the door. “Wait up, wait up.” I call after her while rubbing my
      eyes awake. I can’t have her leave just like that when she waited for me
      to get up. “I can at least get you a breakfast.” That stops her. Food must
      really get to her. As I thought, she’s just as hungry as anyone else would
      be after her ordeal last night. Now then, I’ve got some pasta and olive
      oil at the ready, which makes spaghetti the obvious choice for breakfast.
      I quickly whip up two portions of it and carry it to my dinner table, and
      we eat it together. Since it seems like she’s not in a talking mood, I
      turn on the TV to watch some morning news. It’s the usual diet of homicide
      in the city, but this one gave me a strange feeling. “Ah, strange
      whodunits with a tinge of the weird. Just the kind of news that Miss Tōko
      would love.” If I had said that in the office, I’d probably already be
      smacked upside the head with a projectile shoe. But the news item is
      bizarre. The reporter on the scene told the story. Seems four bodies were
      found in an underground bar that had been abandoned for a half a year. All
      four of them had had their limbs torn off, and the crime scene was filled
      with blood. The scene is pretty close by, maybe four stations or so away
      from where we were drinking last night. I make a mental note of the fact
      that the news said that their limbs were “torn off” and not “cut off.”
      Regardless, the news has nothing more on that angle, and goes on to
      describe the details on the victims’ lives: all teenagers, and delinquents
      who frequently hung around the neighborhood. It seems they were slinging
      drugs too; corner boys. They have a citizen on the mike now, commenting on
      the victims. “Those kids knew what they were getting into, and they got
      it. I think they deserved to die.” And with those words, I turn the TV
      off. I hate it when people say those things, and I hate it even more when
      the media goes out of its way to give people like that the time of day. I
      turn back to look at my guest only to find her with a hand on her stomach
      just like last night. She hasn’t even touched her food. There really must
      be something wrong with her stomach. She looks down, such that I can’t see
      her face. “Nobody deserves to die,” she says in between ragged breaths,
      causing her next words come out in whispers. “Why does it still throb?
      It’s already healed over, but why—“ Suddenly, she stands up not altogether
      calmly, making the chair fall to the floor with a noise, and runs to the
      door. I start to stand up to go after her, but with head still cast
      downwards, she raises a palm towards me, as if to say I shouldn’t come
      near her. “Wait, calm down. I think I can—”, I start to say, but she cuts
      me off. “No, please. Now I know…I can never go back.” That face—a face of
      pain and resistance, a face of contradiction—somehow reminds me of Shiki.
      The girl calms down a bit, bows deeply before me, and then turns the
      doorknob. “Goodbye,” she says. “I hope we don’t see each other again, for
      both our sakes.” Then she opens the door and runs out. The last thing I
      see is her eyes, because she looked like she was about to cry.
