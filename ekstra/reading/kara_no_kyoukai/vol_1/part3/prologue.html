    <h1 class="title">Lingering Pain - Prologue</h1>
    <p>
      When I was little, I played house a lot. I had a pretend family, with a
      pretend pet, a pretend kitchen, and I would cook pretend food. But one
      day, a real blade had accidentally been mixed up in the artificial,
      pretend ones. I had never seen a toy that sharp before, and I used it to
      play, and in the process cut myself deeply between the fingers. I
      approached my mother with red soaked palms outstretched, and I remember
      her scolding me for it, then crying and embracing me, saying “I know it
      hurts, but we’ll fix it,” over and over again. It was not her consolation
      that made me happy, but her embracing me, and so I started to cry as well.
      “Don’t worry, Fujino. The pain will go away once the wound heals,” she
      said while wrapping a bandage around my hand. At the time, I didn’t
      understand what she was trying to say. Because not even for a moment did I
      feel any pain. Lingering Pain 0. “Well, she certainly has her way of
      introducing herself,” the professor remarks. The university science lab
      has that synthetic smell of chemical disinfectants that reminds me more of
      hospitals. But the laboratory equipment dispels any notion of that
      quickly. As does the white-coated professor who Miss Tōko sent me to meet
      today, who now displays a reptilian smile of full white teeth while
      offering a handshake. I take it. “So you have an interest in
      parapsychology, eh?” he asks. “Not really. I just want to know some minor
      things about the topic.” “And that’s what you call ‘interest.’” He
      wrinkles his nose, satisfied at his show of wit. “Well, it doesn’t matter
      anyway. I’d expect nothing less from her associate. I mean, she asks you
      to hand her business card as an introduction. She was always a unique one,
      and talented. I wish our university had more students of her caliber.”
      “Er…yes, I’m sure your student problems are important.” I’m starting to
      see where Miss Tōko gets her ability to ramble so much from. “But I was
      asking about—“ “Ah, yes, yes, parapsychology. There are many different
      phenomena that fall under that label. Our university doesn’t really deal
      with it, however. I’m sure you can understand when I say it’s treated as
      quack science by most in my field. There are very few universities here in
      Japan still giving grants for parapsychology studies. Even so, I’ve heard
      a few have had some marginal successes, though the actual details don’t
      really—“ “Yes, professor, I’d imagine those studies are fascinating, but
      I’m more interested in how people end up having them in the first place.”
      “Well, to simplify, you can liken it to a card game. You play card games,
      don’t you? What card game is the most popular right now?” I scratch my
      head, deciding to go along with this man’s logic. “Erm…poker, I guess?”
      “Ah yes, poker. I’ve had my own fond memories with that game.” He clears
      his throat for a moment, then moves on. “Let us say that human brains are
      all playing a game. Your brain and mine are playing poker. Most everyone
      else in society is playing poker as well. There are other games, but we
      can’t play them. Everyone is in consensus that poker is the game we have
      to play, because that’s how we define being normal. Are you following me
      so far?” “So you’re saying that everyone plays a boring card game?” “But
      see, that’s what makes it better for everyone. Since everyone plays poker,
      we’re protected by arbitrary, but absolute rules of our own creation, and
      thus we can live in a peaceful consensus.” “But if I’m getting you right,
      you’re saying the other games aside from poker aren’t so clear cut?” “We
      can only speculate. Say some other minds are playing a game with rules
      that have an allowance for plants to communicate, and maybe other minds
      prefer a game that has rules that say you can move a body other than your
      own. These are not the same games as poker. They have their own consensus,
      their own rules. When you play poker, you play by its rules, but those
      playing by the rules of other games don’t conform. To them, poker doesn’t
      make a lick of sense. “So you’re saying that people not ‘playing poker’,
      so to speak, have some mental abnormalities?” “Exactly. Consider a person
      that knew no other game than the game where you could communicate with
      plants. In the rules of his game, he talks to plants, but he can’t talk to
      people. People who see him then brand him as crazy and put him in the
      funhouse. If he really could talk to plants, then that’s a person with
      paranormal abilities right there: a person that plays a different game,
      follows different rules, than the game society plays. However, I’d imagine
      most people with these sorts of abilities are still capable of switching
      their mindsets, so that they can still live mostly unnoticed in society.”
      “Which makes the person that only plays the game where you can talk to
      plants a crazy person, since he lacks the shared subconscious experience
      and consensus inherent in playing poker, am I right? If he only knows the
      other game, and can’t switch between the two, then he’s considered
      mentally damaged.” “That’s right. Society calls these people serial
      killers and psychopaths, but I would phrase them more appropriately as
      ‘living paradoxes’: People who, because they play by irregular rules of
      reality, make their existence itself a contradiction to reality. People
      who shouldn’t be able to exist, who can’t exist.” He pauses for a half
      beat to collect himself, then added. “This is all hypothetical, of
      course.” As if he needed to say it. “Of course, professor. Is there any
      way to correct a living paradox like you said?” “You’d have to destroy the
      very rules they play by within their minds. But destroying the brain just
      equates to killing them, so there’s really no easy way, or really no other
      way but to kill them. No one can just suddenly alter a state of mind or
      ability like that. If there was, then that person himself would also be
      playing a different game with different rules. Something like solitaire. I
      hear that game has some pretty complex rules in it.” The professor laughs
      heartily, apparently immensely amused at his own joke. I can’t say I share
      the sentiment. “Thanks, professor. You’ve helped loads. I suppose now I
      know what I’ll do when I encounter psychokinetic people.” I say it only
      half sarcastically. “Psychokinesis? Like bending spoons, things like
      that?” Oh, brother, here we go again. “Or heck, why not a human arm?” That
      one was less of a joke. “If we’re going by spoon bending, then you have
      nothing to fear. The force required to bend a spoon would take days to
      distort a human arm. If there was someone who could bend an arm, I suggest
      a hasty withdrawal.” Now that he mentions it, now’s probably the right
      time for a hasty withdrawal myself. “I’m sorry to cut this short,
      professor, but I really need to go. I have to get to Nagano, and I’d like
      to do it today. Sorry for eating up too much of your time.” “Oh, no, it’s
      quite alright. Any friend of hers is a friend of mine. Come by any time
      you need to. And send my regards to Aozaki, won’t you?” Fujino Asagami,
      still in a state of confusion and disorientation, pulls herself up in the
      middle of a darkened room. The silhouettes of people standing and milling
      about, once so familiar, are now gone. The light isn’t turned on. No, not
      quite right. There was no light in the first place, and darkness stretches
      all over the room, with nary a peek or a beam of light seeping in. She
      exhales a long sigh, and brushes her long, black hair lightly with
      trembling fingers. The loose tassel of hair she once hung lazily on her
      left shoulder is now gone, probably cut off by the man with the knife
      while he was on top of her. After remembering that, she slowly surveys the
      room around her. This is– was –an underground bar. Half a year ago, this
      bar ran into financial difficulties, and it was abandoned. Not long after,
      it became just another abandoned establishment blending in the dying city,
      a haunt for various delinquents and robbers. Much of the effects from its
      better days still lay forgotten inside. In the corner rests a banged up
      pipe chair. In the middle of the room, next to Fujino, is a single pool
      table. Everywhere in the room, convenience store food is scattered in
      rotting, half-finished piles with cockroaches scrabbling all over the
      remains, and a mountain of garbage is stacked haphazardly to one side. In
      a corner, a bucket is almost filled with urine, a communal container to
      compensate for the lack of a working toilet. The combined stench of it all
      is potent, and almost makes Fujino vomit. With no light and no way to know
      where you are, this dark, secluded ruin could have been in a skid row of
      some far off country for all anyone knows. One wouldn’t even think there
      was a normal city on the other side of the door on the top of the
      stairwell. The faint smell of the alcohol lamp those men brought here is
      the only thing that maintains any sense of normalcy. “Umm…” Fujino
      mumbles. She looks around slowly, as if this scene is completely routine.
      Her body had gotten up from the pool table, but her mind still has some
      catching up to do. She picks up a nearby wrist, flesh showing tears and
      seemingly twisted off from the arm. Wrapped lovingly and securely around
      it is a digital wristwatch, and in glowing green text, it shows the date:
      July 20, 1998. The time: 8:00pm, not even an hour after what happened. All
      at once, Fujino is assailed by sudden, blinding pain in her abdomen, and
      she lets slip a strained grunt. She staggers from the ache, and barely
      stops herself from falling face first to the floor by supporting herself
      with her hands. As soon as her palms touch the floor, she hears a soft
      splash. Remembering that it had been raining today, she realizes that the
      whole room is flooded with water…and something else. She takes a moment’s
      glance at her abdomen, and sees the distinct spatter of dried blood—right
      in the place where those men stabbed her. The man who stabbed Fujino was a
      familiar face to anyone in this part of town. He seemed to be the
      ringleader of a crew that consisted of high school dropouts and various
      drifters of similar minds and motivations. They did what they felt:
      stick-ups, assault, robbery, arson, drugs, you name it. They plied their
      trade in the forgotten maze of backlanes between the buildings of the
      commercial district, where no neon glow or curious glance could ever
      reach. They emerged from these alleys to the harsh lights of the peopled
      avenues for only short intervals, to catch their victims through coercion
      or force and had their twisted entertainment for the night. It is on one
      such normal night that this crew and Fujino crossed paths. It was a
      perfect setup. A student of Reien Girl’s Academy, and quite good looking,
      Fujino became a prime target for the men. Perhaps fearing public
      vilification, Fujino never told anyone of how she was victimized. This
      fact eventually reached the ears of the men, however, after which whatever
      hesitance they might have had about being found out disappeared. They
      raped her again and again, bringing her to this underground bar after
      school. Tonight was supposed to be another routine night, like always, but
      their leader apparently got tired of just doing Fujino. He brought out a
      knife, probably to bring something a little new to the table. He’d felt
      offended by what Fujino did: how she just lived her days as if they hadn’t
      done anything to her at all, as if what they did to her didn’t humiliate
      her. He felt he needed more proof of Fujino’s humiliation and his
      dominance. And he needed just that little bit of violence, that little
      ounce of extra pain for that, hence the knife. But Fujino didn’t even
      react, her face a blank expression, even when he had a knife ready to dig
      deep in her face. This made him truly incensed. He pushed her down to the
      table, and got to work. Casting her eyes downward, Fujino looks at her
      blood-soaked clothes and thinks: I can’t go out looking like this. Her own
      spilt blood is concentrated only on her abdomen, but she’s soaked in their
      blood from head to toe. How stupid of me to get dirtied like this. Her
      foot hits one of their scattered limbs on the floor, and it gives a little
      shake in response. She considers her options. If she waits one more hour,
      the number of pedestrians will start to dwindle. And the fact that it’s
      raining only helps. It’s summer, so it’s not too cold. She’ll just let the
      rain wash some of the blood of her, and go to a park and clean herself up
      there. After coming to this conclusion, she calms down. Walking away from
      the dark pool of water and blood, she takes a seat at the pool table,
      taking a count of the scattered limbs to find out how many corpses are
      lying on the floor. One. Two. Three. Four. Four. Four. Four? No matter how
      many times I count, it only comes down to four! A mix of astonishment and
      terror. One is missing. “So, one of them managed to escape,” Fujino
      murmurs to herself. She lets slip a small sigh. If so, I’ll be caught by
      the police. If he’d already run to a station, I’ll be arrested for sure.
      But could he really tell the police? How would he be able to explain what
      just happened? Would he tell them how they kidnapped and violated me, and
      told me to shut up? He’d need a cover story. And none of them were ever
      smart enough for that. She lights the alcohol lamp on the billiard table
      to get a better view. Its flickering orange glow illuminates the entire
      room, making the shadows twirl and dance. The story of violence in the
      room is quite visible now: sixteen arms, sixteen legs, four torsos, four
      heads, and wet blood spatters in every direction. Fujino is unfazed by the
      brutality of the scene before her. No time to think on that. After all,
      the count was missing one, which meant she still had something to do. Do I
      have to take revenge? Her body trembles as if to reinforce her lack of
      conviction. No more killing, she tries to tell herself, as earnestly as
      she possibly can. But she remembers what they did to her, and what they
      could do to her if she doesn’t permanently shut the mouth of the one who
      escaped. Her body trembles again, not in anger, but in something else.
      Delight? A relishing of what is to come? And, for the moment at least,
      what doubt lingers in her mind vanishes. On Fujino’s blood tinted
      reflection on the floor, a little smile plays across her face.
