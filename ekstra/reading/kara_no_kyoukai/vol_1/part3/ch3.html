    <p>
      Though I really didn’t want to resort to this, I am left without any other
      alternative. I decide to contact an old high school friend to see if I can
      borrow some money. I know what places he haunts. I go to the university I
      dropped out of not two months ago and wait for him in the cafeteria. Just
      a few minutes after noon, right on schedule, the large, imposing shadow of
      Gakuto comes into view, easy to pick out among the crowd smaller than him.
      Spotting me, he swaggers on over to my table. “Well, look who decided to
      come back! How you hangin’, man? Here to stay for good this go around?”
      “Unfortunately, no. School treating you well?” “Ah, you know, this here’s
      a game that needs to be played, so I play it. How about you? If I know you
      like I know you, you ain’t gonna holler at me just for a social call.
      What’s the trouble? How’d that job hunt go?” “Great, actually. Got a job.”
      “So what’s wrong?” “The job,” I reply dryly. “My generous employer has
      decided that she’ll forego the usual paycheck this month, so that leaves
      me hanging in the wind.” Gakuto makes a face halfway between
      disappointment and genuine bemusement. “That ain’t so bad, man. And here I
      was thinking it was gonna be some profoundly life changing shit, and you
      drag your broke ass all the way down here for extra dough? You sure you’re
      not some alien in disguise?” “Very funny. When you’ve got your back
      against a corner like this, you can expect the same hospitality.” “But to
      have money being the first thing out of your mouth; it just ain’t like
      you. And anyway, ain’t your folks supposed to have your back on this one?”
      “Me and my parents haven’t talked since the big fight we had when I
      stopped going to university. How can I go back to them right now like
      this? It’d be like surrendering.” “You got as thick a head as me
      sometimes, I give you that. Now, don’t tell me you called your folks names
      and shouted in their faces or something?” “I’ll thank you to leave that
      out of the discussion and focus on the real topic. So are you gonna lend
      me some or aren’t you?” “Damn, man, you in a fighting mood today. But
      there ain’t no need to be, ‘cause I’m feeling awful generous. Plenty from
      our school called you a friend back then, Mikiya, and that includes me. If
      I put it out that you’re in need of cash, we’d all be pitching in to help.
      So don’t worry, man. We got your back.” Gakuto pats me on the shoulder.
      “Don’t misunderstand, though, this ain’t charity,” he adds. “Friends gotta
      look out for each other, after all.” Seems Gakuto’s got his own favor to
      ask as well. He looks over the crowd carefully to see if no one is
      listening in, then leans his head in closer to me and whispers. “The short
      of it is that there’s some youngin I want you to look for. Old junior from
      back in the day, actually. Seems he gone and had his ass caught up in some
      heinous shit, and he hasn’t come home yet.” Gakuto continues to explain,
      mentioning the name of the person in question: Keita Minato. Gakuto knows
      him as a member of the bunch that got cut up last night in the bar, but
      apparently he’s alive. Whereabouts unknown, but at a period of time after
      the time of the killings put out by the police, Keita called up a mutual
      friend of him and Gakuto. The friend then contacted Gakuto, saying Keita
      was acting strange and incoherent. “He just kept shoutin’ that he was
      gonna die and someone be hunting his ass down. After that, nuthin. Don’t
      even answer his cell now. Guy who took the call says he was mixing his
      words and shit, sounding really doped up.” The fact that even a high
      school kid like Keita could purchase dope without us so much as being
      surprised was just a fact of the times. Many of the corners and alleys of
      mazelike Tokyo have quickly turned into open-air drug markets, proof of
      the increasingly high demand for stimulants and depressants that so many
      people turn to for the clarity and solace that they felt society could not
      give them. However, when you’re the survivor of a mass murder and you feel
      that the killer is coming for you next, when you’re a person like Keita
      Minato in other words, your next fix should really be the last thing on
      your mind. “I kinda feel like I’m being thrown into the fire without a
      hose here. Do you really think I can survive talking to these hoppers on
      my own?” “I’ve faith. You always been like a bloodhound, finding people
      with next to nuthin to go on.” “This Keita kid—does he often do drugs?”
      “Far as I know, no. Only them corner boys killed last night were married
      to them acid blotters. But if what the friend’s saying be for real, he
      might’ve had a change of heart. Come on man, you still can’t search your
      head for Keita? He’s that kid that like to tail around your ass some in
      high school.” “I kinda have a vague idea, yeah…” During high school, there
      were some juniors who liked to hang around me for some reason, possibly
      because of me being friends with cool kid Gakuto here. “Well, if he’s just
      having a really bad acid trip, then that’d be good…or at least better than
      what we’re suspecting,” I mention with a sigh. “Guess I got no choice if I
      want to live this month. I’ll check it out and see what I can do. Can you
      tell me about his friends? Contacts, connections, anything?” Gakuto
      reaches into his pocket to retrieve a small notebook, as if he was just
      waiting for me to say it. There’re a lot of names, aliases, addresses for
      hang outs, and phone numbers in that notebook, which means a lot of ground
      to cover if I want this done quick. “I’ll be in touch if I find out
      anything. If I manage to find him, I’ll try to see him protected as best
      as I can. That good?” By protection, I mean in the form of my detective
      cousin Daisuke. He didn’t have anything to fear from him. Daisuke’s the
      kind of guy that can let you go for a drug abuse charge if you were
      witness to a red ball murder, which this one could end up as, what with
      the mutilation and multiple homicide. Far as Daisuke was concerned,
      nabbing the users is small game and a waste of time. Gakuto nods his
      assent, thanks me, and gives me 20,000 yen to start me off. Once me and
      Gakuto go our separate ways, I start to make my way to the crime scene.
      I’ll have to work this one at least vaguely similar to how cousin Daisuke
      works cases if I would have any chance of finding Keita. I know that I
      shouldn’t really get involved in this, but Gakuto was right. Friends have
      to look out for each other, after all. The sound of a ringing phone
      resonates in my empty apartment. I screen the call, as I am wont to do
      when I’m tired, and sure enough, after five rings it switches to the
      answering machine with a beep. Cue his voice: familiar, yet still feels
      alien enough so soon after recovering from the coma. “Morning, Shiki.
      Sorry to call you so early, but I’ve got a small favor to ask if it isn’t
      too much trouble. Azaka and I promised to meet at a café near Ichigaya
      station called Ahnenerbe around noon, but something came up and it looks
      like I won’t be able to go. You’re free today, right? If you can, drop by
      there and tell her I’m not coming.” The message ends there. I roll my body
      sluggishly over to the bedside and take a look at my clock, a digital
      green “July 22, 7:23am” on its screen; not even four hours since I came
      home from my nightly outing. Christ, do I need sleep. I pull the sheets
      back over my head. The summer heat doesn’t really bother me much. I’ve
      been able to deal well with the heat and cold ever since my childhood
      days, and it seems that trait carried over from my…previous life. Just as
      sleep was about to take me again, the phone rang a second time. This time,
      when the answering machine picked up the message, it was a voice I knew,
      but definitely one you didn’t want to hear at just half past seven in the
      morning. “It’s me. Watched the news this morning? Probably haven’t. That’s
      all right, I didn’t either.” What the hell? It’s always been at the back
      of my mind, but now I can definitely say that I have absolutely no idea
      what the fuck goes on in Tōko’s head; it is an incomprehension that
      sometimes continues on to her speech more often than I’m comfortable. It
      requires at least a few precious seconds of cranial spelunking before you
      can start to understand what she’s saying, a trait which always tends to
      leave you at a disadvantage when talking to her. “Listen up. I’m gonna
      phrase this in a way even your sleep-deprived brain can process. Three
      interesting deaths last night. Another jumper that hit pavement, and some
      girl who killed her boyfriend. I know, I know, same shit, different day,
      right? But here’s something that’ll help you out:” she pauses. “Our little
      killer struck again.” Tōko hangs up abruptly, leaving me to wonder what
      she thought I would feel when confronted with these facts. Did she expect
      me to feel a rush of noble intention, and a renewed commitment to this
      job? How could I, when I still see the world I just awakened back into in
      a hazy grey veil, when I am yet to even feel the world of my senses in a
      manner that seemed coherent and real? Harsh as it may be to admit, but the
      deaths of these people with no relation to me faze me less than the rays
      of the sun beating down on me. After sleeping in for a while more, I get
      up much later, only when my fatigue finally gives ground. I cook breakfast
      in the manner that I remember, after which I start to dress. I choose a
      light orange kimono, which should be cooler if I’m going to walk around
      town all day. It’s then that I get that feeling again, which causes me to
      bite my lip: a feeling that someone is watching me do all of this from
      afar. Even my wardrobe choice is one from a memory that I feel far removed
      from. I wasn’t this way two years ago. The two years of emptiness created
      a rift, a boundary line between the past and now, as if creating two very
      different people, yet sharing the same collective memory. It felt as if
      the weight of that memory, those sixteen years of life before the
      accident, kept pulling the strings attached to me. I know it’s probably
      just an after effect of the coma, some brain damage from the accident at
      the worst. I know that no matter how much I spit on this emptiness, this
      fabricated dollhouse of a lie, in the end, it’s still me pulling those
      damn strings. Hell, maybe it’s always been me. By the time I finish
      dressing up it’s almost eleven o’ clock. I press the “Messages” button on
      my answering machine, repeating the first message. “Morning, Shiki…,”
      repeats the voice I have heard many times in the past. Mikiya Kokutō. The
      last person I saw before the accident two years ago. The only person I
      trusted two years ago. I have many recollections of being with him, but
      all of it missing details, as if I was looking at a tampered photograph,
      something in them not squaring with what I know. And one memory is a
      gaping hole, completely gone: my last memory of him and the accident. Why
      was in an accident? Why was Mikiya’s face the last thing I saw? It’s the
      reason I still feel awkward talking to Mikiya: I feel like I should know
      something important about him but it’s missing in my head, and without it
      I won’t be able to carry out an actual conversation without them. If only
      these memories lost to oblivion were stored in an answering machine too.
      “…tell her I’m not coming.” The answering machine stops and falls silent.
      It’s probably just another after effect of the coma, but hearing his voice
      softens the annoying itch in my mind. Problem is, that’s the itch that
      makes me feel alive. It’s the itch that tells me to kill. It’s only a
      short forty minute walk to Ahenenerbe. The café sports their unusual
      German name on a sign hanging above the entrance, which I spare only a
      momentary glance at before entering the establishment. Once inside, I
      immediately notice the dearth of customers, despite it being noon, the
      hour when college kids frequent cafés to write a novel or do some other
      boring activity. The café has little lighting. Its sole sources of bright
      light come from the entrance and four rectangular windows placed on either
      side of the shop, admitting the sunlight and silhouetting the tables and
      customers sitting there in a dark, hard-cut outline. The tables further
      inside the shop aren’t so lucky. It paints a nostalgic picture, as if some
      European middle ages tavern had stepped out of antiquity into the modern
      age. I spot a pair of gaudily uniformed girls in a table way in the back,
      and a quick glance confirms that it is indeed Azaka Kokutō, along with
      another girl. Strange—Mikiya never mentioned another girl. Oh well, no
      biggie. “Azaka,” I call out, while walking briskly to their table. Azaka
      herself is quite a character on her own. She goes to a fancy girl’s
      boarding school, so she acts the part, complete with a tendency for being
      ladylike. But you take one look at the way she carries herself and you
      realize it’s all an act. At her best, she has an amazingly competitive
      streak in her, as well as a boldness that is sorely lacking in many people
      these days. In contrast to her brother, who endears himself to people by
      sheer likeability and charm, Azaka is a figure who commands respect with a
      single, solid look in her eyes. Those eyes now turned to me as she does a
      quick about face at my voice calling out her name. “Shiki…Ryōgi,” she
      says, each syllable uttered and spat out like an insult. The lingering
      animosity towards me that she tries so hard to keep in is so palpable I
      can swear I almost feel the temperature rise. “I have a prior engagement
      with my brother. I have no business with you.” “And it seems your brother
      has a prior engagement of his own,” I say, egging her on. “He said he
      can’t come. You know, this might just be me, but I think you just got
      stood up.” A single restrained gasp. I don’t know if she’s shocked that
      Mikiya just treated their promise like trash, or the fact that it’s coming
      from me and I came down here to tell her. “Shiki, you…you put him up to
      this, didn’t you?!” Azaka’s hands tremble in barely suppressed anger. I
      guess it’s the latter, then. “Don’t be an idiot. He’s done his level best
      to piss me off too. I mean really, asking me to come all the way here just
      to send you away?” Azaka glares at me with eyes full of fire. At that
      moment, her friend, who has until now remained silent, interrupts; and a
      good thing too, since Azaka looks like she’s about to abandon her
      carefully cultivated demeanor of placidity by seeing how well she could
      throw a teacup to my face at point blank range. “Kokutō, everyone’s
      staring,” the girl says in a voice as slender as a wire. Azaka looks
      around the café for half a beat, and then embarrassed, she sighs. “I’m
      sorry, Fujino. I don’t know what came over me. I just ruined your day,
      didn’t I?” she says apologetically. I haven’t really looked at this Fujino
      clearly up until now. Though she and Azaka look somewhat similar by virtue
      of the uniform and their school’s grooming standards, their demeanor
      cannot be more different. While Azaka has a hidden strength behind the
      prim and proper façade, her companion Fujino looks, at a glance, more
      fragile, as if she were sick and could collapse at any second. “Are…you
      okay? You look kind of—“, I involuntarily say. She answers only by looking
      in my direction. The way her eyes pass over me feels as if she’s looking
      at something beyond me, like I was just an insect on the ground to be
      ignored. My gut tells me she’s dangerous, and my mind itches again. My
      reasoning tells me that there’s no way a girl like her could do anything
      like what happened to the victims in that underground bar, and the itch
      recedes. “Never mind, pretend I didn’t say anything,” I conclude. That
      crime scene was the handiwork of someone who enjoyed murder, and a girl
      like this Fujino could be someone like that. Reason says her hands are too
      weak to twist and tear off their limbs like that anyway. I turn my
      attention away from her and back to Azaka. “Well anyway, s’all I got to
      say. Seeing as I seem to be messenger for a day, is there anything you
      want to say to your brother?” “Oh, you’d do that?” says Azaka, who then
      proceeds to clear her throat. “Then please communicate to Mikiya my desire
      for him to terminate relations with you. A woman the likes of you has no
      business being with my brother.” Azaka leaves me a final, satisfied look
      before I go. I watch as the girl in the orange kimono Azaka called Shiki
      Ryōgi walks out the front door of the café without incident. Their verbal
      sparring was tense, and I was sure that if they were armed, they’d have
      been at each other trying to score a cut across the other’s jugular. While
      it didn’t escalate to anything so dramatic, it still stifled me of all but
      one sentence. That Shiki certainly had a…particular way of speaking. Azaka
      mentioned her surname as Ryōgi. If she is, as I suspect, a child of the
      Ryōgi dynasty, then that explains the unusually well-tailored kimono she
      wore. “Lovely looking person, wasn’t she?” I ask Azaka. “Well, I suppose,”
      she replies truthfully. That’s Azaka for you. She’d argue with a person
      and cause a public commotion one second, and admit without shame the same
      person’s better points the next. “But only as lovely as she was
      frightening.” I say this firmly, with no sarcasm or humor. “I don’t like
      her.” It catches both me and Azaka off guard, which is only natural. I
      rarely, if ever, react sharply to other people, after all. “That’s
      surprising. I thought you were the kind of person who wouldn’t hate a dog
      even if it bit you, but I suppose I still have a lot to learn about you,
      don’t I?” Curiously, Azaka equated “hate” with “dislike”, which to me are
      two very different concepts. I didn’t hate Shiki Ryōgi. I only felt that
      she and I would never get along. My mind returns to the moment she and I
      locked eyes on each other. My eyes look over her black hair, her white
      skin, and the black emptiness in her eyes, all somehow ominous, as if
      looking at a cracked mirror, and seeing the distortion looking back on
      you, changed. We both saw what we were trying so desperately to hide
      behind our backs. She has the blood of many on her, and a predatory
      countenance. My gut tells me what I’ve been trying to avoid thinking: she
      is a killer, a cold-blooded murderer. But I’m different. I’m better than
      her. I’ve never even so much as entertained any thought of murder. I say
      it to myself, in the dark, forbidden places of my mind, closing my eyes
      and calling it out repeatedly. Why, then, does she not disappear? It’s as
      if, without even exchanging a single word, Shiki has been indelibly burned
      into memory. “And this was supposed to be our day off too. I’m really
      sorry, Fujino.” Azaka renews her plea. I smile my practiced smile.“It’s
      all right. I wasn’t really feeling up to it today, anyway.” “Well, you are
      looking kind of pale, though it’s hard to tell what with your skin already
      being so white.” That wasn’t the real reason for my lack of enthusiasm,
      but I nod my acknowledgement at Azaka all the same. More importantly, I
      know that my body is continuing a slow slide from bad to worse, but I
      didn’t know that it had reached the point where it showed. “There’s
      nothing we can do about it today,” says Azaka. “I’m just going to ask
      Mikiya myself, so why don’t we head on back for now?” “Thank you for the
      concern,” I reply. “But wouldn’t your brother be at least a little mad at
      what you just said to Shiki before she left?” “Oh, it’s nothing to worry
      about. This is probably the thousandth time I said it to him, so if he’s
      gonna get mad at anything, it would just be me acting like a broken record
      about it. They say belief bends reality, so maybe if I believe it hard
      enough and repeat it over and over like a really pathetic curse, it’ll
      come true, right?” I don’t know if she’s serious or just having fun, but
      I’m already used to her being largely spontaneous, so I wouldn’t at all be
      surprised if that’s something she just made up to make herself feel
      better. With a consistent record as the top notcher in Reien Girl’s
      Academy, and a similarly consistent placement on the national top ten
      rankings, it’s easy to see how the stress of retaining her place can get
      to her. Reien Girl’s Academy provides education anywhere from the first
      grade to college level, and people usually go in there starting from first
      grade until they graduate college. People like Azaka and me, who come in
      after graduating high school, are quite rare. Both of us came from the
      same school, and we applied at the same time, making her one of my very
      few close friends in Reien. We usually go out on weekends and holidays to
      have fun, but today was supposed to have been something else entirely.
      Enduring the events and the memories of the past few days has proven to
      be…difficult, and my depression isn’t so easily willed away. In the midst
      of my difficulty, an old memory of mine came to mind. For some reason, I
      found myself thinking about an old upperclassman, one who of the few who
      talked to me when I was a freshman in a local junior high school. The
      memory comforted me when even the company of other people couldn’t, and I
      cherish it. When I told Azaka about it, she immediately jumped at the
      opportunity to try and find this upperclassman immediately. Apparently,
      her brother knows the neighborhood surprisingly well, and it’s easy for
      him to search for anybody. The truth is, I wasn’t too fond of bothering
      her brother like she suggested, but once Azaka sets out to do something,
      especially something she just decided in the space of a second, she
      follows through. Her brother not being able to come today is regrettable
      but is fortuitous in a way. When I said I really didn’t feel like it
      earlier, the truth of it was that I already met this fabled upperclassman
      two days ago. When I met him, I was finally able to say what I couldn’t
      say three years ago. Maybe Azaka’s brother not coming was God’s way of
      finally putting a lid on the matter. “Let’s scram. I bet they’re thinking
      of throwing our freeloading butts off their establishment just for
      drinking a single cup of tea and stealing a table for an hour.” Azaka
      stands up, and even tries her best to hide how disappointed she is at her
      brother not being able to keep his promise. Azaka might have been acting
      the lady when she was talking to Shiki, but I’m one of those people she
      can be herself around, and at her worst times, she can talk like a sailor
      and lose all sense of formality. It’s not that she’s pretending to be
      something she’s not, but it’s just something she does unconsciously, like
      a filter she can use to weed out people who aren’t worth her time. Azaka
      is a true friend, probably my only one. She shouldn’t be involved in what
      is about to happen, which is why we’ll never see each other again. “Azaka,
      you can go back to the dormitory without me. I think I’ll sleep over at my
      parents’ house tonight.” “You sure? I mean, I’m cool with it, but you’re
      gonna get in trouble with the Directress if this becomes a habit. Don’t
      let it happen too often, okay?” And with a flutter of her cassock, Azaka
      leaves the gloomily lit café. When Azaka opens the door, my eyes suddenly
      catch the sign outside. “Ahnenerbe”: “ancestral heritage” in German. I
      never came to school again after what happened two nights ago. No doubt,
      the school has already contacted my father about my absence without leave.
      And when I come home, I will surely be subject to a strict questioning as
      to what I have been up to in the past two days. And, like a child who has
      finally acquiesced to the whipping, I will tell everything. My father will
      then probably disown me, all because I cannot craft a single convincing
      lie. Except for one lie, the one I told Azaka. That was simple and easy.
      Not like home. Now I’ll never have a home to return to. Home, and each and
      every part of it, is a lie. My father now is mother’s second husband. The
      problem stems from the fact that I come from the first. My father only
      wanted the house, land, and title that my mother’s family would bring him,
      and to him I was just a bonus, an extra, a spare. This consideration of my
      status led me to try harder, to be a woman of faithfulness and virtue like
      my mother, to be a model student my father could be proud of, to be a
      normal girl anyone could trust. I wanted to be that girl so much, not for
      anyone’s sake, but for myself. It was an ambition that drove me and, like
      a charm, protected me, as much from my father as it did from forcing me to
      think about a better life. But the lie is over now. Whatever magic that
      unreachable dream granted me for protection is now forever lost. The sun
      slowly descends to rest, its light now visible only in the gaps between
      the buildings, and it casts long, parallel shadows in the streets of the
      darkening city where I continue to walk. The wave of people coming and
      going, walking the streets in a great roiling mass, the traffic lights
      blinking red to green to red again; I walk amongst all of them. Here and
      there, among both the young and the old, you can see happy faces,
      picturesque expressions of joy all around, and my heart tightens at the
      sight. It’s all like a dream, another lie. On a whim, I pinch my cheek,
      and feel nothing. I pinch harder, twisting skin. Nothing. When I look at
      my hands, I see red on my fingertips. Even though I dug my nails deep
      enough to draw blood, I still feel nothing, no spark of life. I laugh, the
      exhalation coming out in little fits and starts. Is it the soul that hurts
      when I saw the smiles of passersby, or is it, as when people try to hurt
      me with words, really my brain firing neurons to generate a predisposed
      reaction from me? A flash of pain to make you understand that bad things
      are happening and it needs to stop. Whatever the source of the pain,
      whether rejection, abuse, self-defense, or some other cause, all these are
      already after the fact, and whatever justification your brain creates for
      the pain is just like any other drug, a function to make you feel better,
      to sober your soul about what was done, and what has been done to you.
      Though I do not know the common pain, I understand the wounds of the soul,
      and the pain that comes with it. But that particular breed of pain is
      hardly important, nothing more than a fleeting delusion you entertain,
      because the pain of the soul is easily dispelled with the right words from
      the right person speaking them, massaging them into a lie, and you forget
      the pain because it was so trivial. Real pain is not so easily remedied,
      because as long as the wound remains, the pain continues its course,
      throbbing, pulsating, and proving if nothing else, that you are alive. If
      the soul were real, if my soul could be touched, then maybe the wounds on
      it can be real too, and pain, real pain, would follow. Like on that night,
      when those boys violated me. I still remember: their low voices of
      laughter, the shadows on their faces flickering in the light of the
      alcohol lamp. Threats— Shouting— Accusations— Being violated— I remember
      the man lying on top of me, clutching something in his hand raised above
      his head. It caught the light, and for an instant I saw the glint of
      steel. I remember it falling fast, swung downward. Afterwards, I felt a
      warm sensation in my stomach, and when my eyes looked downwards, I see my
      uniform torn in the abdomen and wet with blood. After that, a haze of
      violence and carnage, dealt not by them, but by me, my own doing. I end
      their little lives and realize that the warmth in my stomach was what they
      truly called pain. My heart tightens again. An ethereal voice spoke in my
      ear, but it sounds as if it’s coming from my own head. It tells me that
      there is no mercy, no forgiveness, and it repeats over and over. My legs
      buckle, and the warmth in my belly, now more like a scalding fire, comes
      again; an unseen hand clutching my insides in an ever tightening grip. The
      nausea is overwhelming, more so than usual. I should be slipping into
      unconsciousness by now. An arm goes numb, almost as if it was suddenly
      taken away, and only by looking at it do I know it’s still firmly attached
      to my shoulder. It hurts…so much. Now, I know I am alive. The stab wound
      that I know has been healed now suddenly burns again. In a childhood long
      gone, my mother once told me that the pain would go away once the wound
      heals. But now even that is a lie. Even after the bleeding stops and the
      skin sews itself back on, the pain remains. But mother, I don’t know if
      you understand, but I like this burning sensation. There is no greater
      object that makes me realize I am indeed alive! This is the lingering pain
      that I can be sure is no fleeting delusion. “I need to find him…quickly,”
      I whisper to myself, the words coming out in rapid, ragged bursts. The
      score must be settled, and the life of the boy who escaped must be taken.
      It is the last thing I want to do, but there is no other choice, if I
      don’t want to be hunted down myself as a murderess. And now that I finally
      have the pain I craved for so long, it would be a shame to end it like
      that. No, I’ll have more of this, this pleasure of finally feeling alive.
      My body moans and screams with an ache when I move it, but nevertheless I
      manage to start dragging myself to those corner boys’ usual haunts. Tears
      start to form and fall from my eyes from the sharp pain, but right now,
      even the pain is almost like a beloved companion. I go back to my
      apartment after my little parley with Azaka, trying to catch up on my
      sleep. Only at night do I go out again. So far the job Tōko hired me for
      is still in its early stages, and yet only two days after it adds a fresh
      corpse to its tally, making it a total of five bodies so far: four in the
      underground bar that started this whole mess, and the one that Tōko said
      showed up last night, apparently at some random construction site in the
      same neighborhood. I don’t really see it being related to the four
      originals. But then, Mikiya did say to me once that these people tended to
      know each other at least on a cursory basis if they’re in the same
      neighborhood. They’re hoppers, alley kids, and drifters that are slinging,
      buying, and playing the same game night after night, after all, he said.
      If so, last night’s fatality may have known the bodies in the bar, at
      least by name or reputation. My attention drifts back to the girl Azaka
      was with at Ahnenerbe. I’m still mostly groping in the dark with the
      brand-new capabilities of my Eyes, so I ended up accidentally seeing her
      lines— the traces of death that ran over all things—when I looked straight
      at her. That was careless, even for me. She looked normal enough, very
      much like your average stuck up rich kid. But she was hiding blood in her
      past; of that much I’m sure. Her eyes told her story well enough: hers was
      a liminal existence, tied by one fragile string to one side of her life,
      and being pulled like a metal to a magnet to the other, as if she belongs
      there. I mean, fuck, of all people, I should know the feeling. We read
      each other like two predators back there, and my gut tells me she’s the
      one, but I can’t entirely be sure. I don’t see, or at least I don’t yet
      see, a reason for her being someone who enjoys murder as much as I do. But
      then, since when did killers in this town start needing a reason to enjoy
      killing? Hah, “enjoy killing.” I wonder what Mikiya would think if he
      heard me saying that. He’d probably give me a stern telling-to, saying
      “murderin’ be a purty steep crime, Shiki” while waving a finger in front
      of me. What an utter idiot, I muse, as much to myself as to Mikiya who
      must be half-way across town right now. Mikiya once said to me that I
      haven’t changed from before. I wonder, then, if I was always like this
      even before the accident: walking around town aimlessly, a woman a little
      off her rocker searching for something to kill. I try to tell myself that
      no, never had any liking for this sort of stuff, or if she had, it
      certainly wasn’t in her laundry list of priorities. This was always
      Shiki’s line of thinking. Shiki, the man—yin, dwelling inside the
      woman—yang. But then, where does that put me? Shiki was here before, but
      he’s gone now. Dead, probably, or something like it. Then that means this
      desire to kill isn’t anything else but my own, and I can’t let some other
      personality take the fall for it. Tōko had the right of it I suppose. This
      case does fit me like a glove. I mean, holy shit, I get to kill someone
      with no strings attached! It’s almost midnight. I ride the subway to a
      station I rarely get off at. The city is sleepless tonight, the noise
      rising to the all too common chorus of the streets: the melody of traffic
      and speeding cars; and then the background vocals: the shouting and
      arguments echoing in the streets; and now the percussions: the sound of
      bats and pipes and knives, setting the tempo by claiming their share of
      screaming victims; and then the main vocals: the siren wail of the police
      rollers; and always, the footsteps are there, in some places a scattered
      rhythm, in some a low rumble, all of them here in this labyrinthine city.
      Here, from the exit of the station, I can see the tall cargo cranes and
      stacks of shipping containers, themselves as tall as a house or larger,
      that reveal the short distance to the port. I don’t know where the last
      one ran off to, but I’ve thought of a way to solve that problem. I was
      taken to a lot of places by those men. They had hangouts scattered all
      over the neighborhood, places where they could unwind before they did me.
      I might find out where the last one is hiding by going back to these
      places and asking the people he knows there. They must know. He can’t rely
      on his parents, or his school, or the police, so he has no other recourse
      but his own kind. Walking the city at night is something I’ve never gotten
      used to, and a little part of me keeps saying that I should just go home
      and not bother with going to these shady night dens, but the pain and the
      filthy memories propel my feet step by step. At a large karaoke bar, the
      third place I visited tonight, I finally manage to meet a person who
      claims to be a friend of Keita Minato. An employee of the establishment,
      he lets slip a dirty smile when we talk, and suggests that we go to a
      quiet place to talk. Ditching his shift, we walk again. The little voice
      tells me that this is another trap, another game we play before he jumps
      me like the others. He knows how weak I am. He can smell it, and the smile
      he made while we were talking was him reading me as easy prey. He must
      know what Keita Minato and his friends did to me, and he thinks he can do
      it too. That’s why he hasn’t a worry on his mind right now. Even knowing
      all this, I ignore the voice and follow him. He’s my only chance at
      finding my lost one, and I’m not going to pass it up. We arrive at a
      lonely stretch of road. I grip my burning stomach even tighter, and
      prepare myself. It’s almost midnight. For the hundredth time tonight, I
      summon the memory of me being violated, and my conviction is renewed, my
      steps unyielding. The city whispers again tonight, the noise coming
      together in its regular volume: the shudders in the air from the breaths
      of the pained, the sighing release of the dying, and the whispers of the
      dead. This is a place that bleeds, suffers, and dies every night, and for
      a moment I come to an understanding with this labyrinthine city. Here in
      this barely lit strip of road with this wretched man, I can see the
      warehouses and silos, black silhouettes towering in the sky, that reveal
      the short distance to the port. Luck’s on his side tonight, thinks the
      young man. Keita and his buddies were a talkative bunch, always consummate
      loudmouths talking about the rich girl they kept banging over and over
      again every week. For his part, the young man had long since resigned the
      matter to the back part of his brain where he could filter out all their
      voices as just meaningless background noise, just part of their routine.
      What they did in their spare time was their business, not his, always had
      been. Keita and his group weren’t anyone special, and every one had grown
      up in a different corner of the hood anyway, so it wasn’t his job to butt
      in, and anyway the story had sounded suspiciously embellished right from
      the start so he tended to take it with a grain of salt in the first place.
      But then, the girl coming to his job on his shift was just too
      irresistible a treat. Oh sure, he knew she was the girl they were talking
      about. She fit the bill exactly: rich girl from a rich kid school. Now, on
      a regular occasion, he’d be on a payphone right now telling his crew about
      the find, to share the fun. But as good a friend as he was, this was not
      an opportunity that necessitated a lot of people. This was not, in other
      words, the kind of easy alley gang bang he and four other boys would
      occasionally engage in. It’s a whole different ball game this time, seeing
      as he recognizes the girl as family to the owners of Asagami Construction,
      the daughter if he remembered correctly. They’re the kind of upper crust
      clan who put a premium value on appearances and the gossip about them in
      the local patrician society. Raping this girl and threatening to divulge
      the dirty details to the public later, maybe even with some carefully
      selected photos, was as good as him dipping his hands into the family
      wallet himself; for this is a family that would sooner settle the matter
      with money than drag the whole scandal through the publicity of a trial.
      That’s why he didn’t call his friends tonight. To him, this was a case of
      too many cooks spoiling the broth. This is a solid caper, thinks the young
      man; a caper Keita and those dumb fuckers never thought of. Despite being
      the leader of a semi-famous crew in the neighborhood, the man Keita and
      the others followed were so dumb they probably couldn’t figure out which
      way to point a gun if they shot themselves looking down the barrel. Fujino
      Asagami keeps pace with the man without a single word. It almost makes him
      a little nervous. Bad idea to bring her to the usual places, he thinks, so
      he heads to the warehouse section of the harbor. There’s little light, and
      at this midnight hour, the longshoremen would be home and there’d be no
      one guarding the place. When they enter the dark spaces between the tall
      warehouses, he finally turns to face the girl. The sound of the waves and
      the faint traces of light coming from the Broad Bridge construction site
      nearby compound to the uneasiness of Fujino’s silence, but the man shrugs
      it away. “This should be far enough,” he mutters. “So, what did you wanna
      ask about?” He figures he might as well answer Fujino’s question. Not
      letting her voice her question, after all, would be in bad form. “Er, yes.
      Would you happen to know where Mr. Keita is now?” she finally says after a
      full five-second delay. Through all of this Fujino hadn’t been making eye
      contact with the man. Her eyes, half-obscured by her well-kept bangs, were
      downcast and seemed to alternate in interest between the one hand she had
      on her stomach and the floor. “Nah, girl, Keita ain’t been seen ‘round
      here last few days. I heard he ain’t even got a place of his own, so he
      bounce around, crashing in a different crib every week with his peoples.
      Far as I know, he ain’t got a cell either, so you can’t connect with him.”
      “No…I can contact him.” She’s talking weird. She doesn’t know where Keita
      is even though she can contact him? Did those guys fuck her so much her
      brain shut off or something? That should make things a lot smoother for
      business later, but he had to admit he’d been expecting a little
      resistance. He likes his girls with fight in them. “Oh, well, cool then,”
      he responds. “Then why dontcha just ring him up and ask then?” “That
      is…well…it seems Mr. Keita doesn’t want to tell me where he’s hiding.
      That’s why I’m looking all over and asking his friends. Please, I’d only
      like an answer. It’s perfectly fine if you don’t know.” “Wait, hold the
      fuck up. Whatchoo mean he’s hiding? He gone and got hisself into some deep
      shit, ain’t he?” She was beginning to irritate him. Having not seen the
      news himself, he considers for a moment the possibility that Keita raping
      Fujino had leaked out somehow, a thought easily dismissed when he realizes
      that, were that the case, it wouldn’t be Fujino herself coming for Keita,
      but the cops with a wagon and a waiting interview room downtown. “Oh, I
      see what this about now, girl. Now that Keita’s gone and dumped you, you
      come hollering for another man, am I right?” The smile which never left
      his face now turns into amused laughter. If he was really lucky tonight
      and Fujino became his woman, he might not even need threats to get the
      money. She’s no slouch in the looks either. Money and a woman: what else
      could he call this but the Almighty himself putting some polish in his
      life? “We probably shoulda rolled over to my place. Or are you fine doing
      it here?” The girl in the black uniform nods. “I’d like an answer before
      that,” she says. “Bitch, shut yo mouth with that excuse. I mean, like I
      know where he crashing at before he shoot up. I dunno, and I ain’t got a
      yearning to know.” Fujino looks up, a content look on her face. Her eyes
      hold no warmth now, save for a faint light in her pupils that was not
      there before, a light that shines like a spiral. All normality seems to
      have left it. For his part, the man is less focused on her eyes and more
      on the odd situation that is taking place on one of his arms, which has
      started to move by itself. His elbow starts to turn, the flesh there
      contorting, slightly at first but then more severe, in the manner of
      something being twisted. A small creaking sound of the bone accompanies
      the elbow twisting past the ninety degree mark, but it doesn’t stop there.
      Within another moment, it finally breaks with a single popping noise. The
      young man manages a short, piercing shriek, his voice slipping out like
      gas from a balloon at first, but then growing into a scream when his arm
      breaks. Earlier he had kept praising his luck, but he’s one of those who
      can’t distinguish between the good and the bad kind, and whatever amount
      of good luck he had tonight has definitely run out. In this narrow
      alleyway between two warehouses untouched by moonlight, the first
      stirrings of tragedy begin to unfold. Since the first twist, the man’s
      scream has gone from recognizably human to something resembling the baying
      of some beast. His arms don’t even look like arms anymore. They’re more
      like wire puzzles, or one of those rubber bands twisted around to make
      paper airplanes fly. At any rate, they’re not going to go back to anything
      resembling functioning arms any time soon. “H-h-help!” he shouts in vain.
      He tries to run away from the girl, who only stands still before him, but
      finds his efforts to do so are hampered by his right leg suddenly being
      torn to a bloody pulp from the knee, and his body stumbling into air and
      slamming into pavement. Blood scatters with a sickening splat, as if
      someone emptied a bucket full of it on the concrete walls, the spatter
      looking like some obscene piece from a modern art museum. Fujino Asagami,
      with eyes lighted by some flickering flame of spiral behind them, watches
      the entire scene unfold. “A…screw, she’s sc—, she’s screwing me, haha!”
      His words are almost unintelligible. Somehow, amidst the blinding pain, he
      finds the will to laugh at his own private joke. Fujino decides to ignore
      him and continue. “Bend,” she whispers softly, like a curse, the same
      curse she’s been using since she started this. Her friend once told her
      that belief bends reality, that repeating something over and over like a
      curse might cause it to come true. The man is squirming on the ground,
      with both arms twisted and with one less leg, moving his head from side to
      side. The blood flowing from the open leg has formed a red carpet on the
      ground, welcoming Fujino. She steps into the carpet, her shoes dipping
      into it slightly. The sweet fragrance of the blood around her resembled
      the hot, humid, and sticky air of the summer so much. She emits a sigh as
      she looks down at the writhing mass of flesh before her. That she has to
      do this is regrettable, detestable even, but necessary, something she had
      intended to do right from the start. Fujino knew from the way he was
      hitting on her that he was yet to be enlightened by what happened at that
      underground bar. But it was only a matter of time before he did, and when
      that happened, he would also remember Fujino asking about Keita Minato. It
      wouldn’t take long before he put two and two together, and start to
      suspect Fujino, maybe even report her to the police. So this is something
      she truly has to do. And that besides, the man had been asking for it.
      Though it was indirect, this is nothing less than her revenge against the
      ones that violated her. Luckily, her ability to violate them turns out to
      be much more potent. “Forgive me—but I have no choice.” The young man’s
      remaining left leg is ripped to shreds in a manner similar to its
      counterpart. The man, who had been hanging onto a small thread of life
      earlier, expires with a final convulsion that continues even after his
      death. Before, Fujino would look at a body like this and she wouldn’t feel
      a shred of empathy. But now, having finally known pain, she understands,
      and she sympathizes, and she is glad. She knows now that to live is to
      feel pain. “Only through this can I finally be normal.” She was the one
      who made the man this way. She was the one who hurt him. She is better
      than him, than all of them. This is what it means to live, Fujino thinks;
      to be able to celebrate true happiness only in the midst of such cruelty
      and suffering by becoming cruel as well. “Mother, am I no longer human for
      going this far?” The burning in Fujino’s stomach has become almost
      unbearable as her heart pumps blood faster and faster, the beating the
      only thing she hears. Despite the summer heat, a shiver worms its way up
      her spine. “I never wanted to murder people—“ “Oh, I beg to differ.”
      Fujino turns towards the sudden intruder. Silhouetted against the
      moonlight reflected off the harbor waters, a single kimono-clad figure
      stands in the entrance of the narrow alley: Shiki Ryōgi. “Miss…Shiki?”
      “Fujino Asagami, huh? It’s all in the name. I should have known you were
      related to the Asakami dynasty.” Lightly, Shiki starts to walk towards the
      alley interior. With narrowing eyes, she observes the scene of carnage
      around her. “When did you—“, Fujino starts to ask, but she already knows
      the answer. “Ever since you lured that lump of meat out here, I was
      watching the whole time,” Shiki says coldly. That means she saw
      everything. She saw it but didn’t try to stop it. Even knowing what would
      happen, she revealed herself, ensuring that only one question races
      through Fujino’s mind: why? “He is not a lump of meat!” says Fujino
      angrily, thinking Shiki’s casual callousness going too far, even despite
      her own thoughts earlier. “He is—was—a human being.” “You sure? ‘Cause, at
      least to my understanding, he doesn’t look too much like one right now.
      Fact is, you butchered him, and he didn’t die like a human at all.” Shiki
      continues to advance, her pace quickening with each step, boots clicking
      with each advance. “He probably was human before, but humans don’t end
      their life that way. It’s a death removed from all boundaries of common
      sense, and it deprives him of all meaning. You deprived him of all
      meaning. You chopped him up good and proper just like a, well…like a lump
      of meat. Good entertainment, though.” The declaration makes Fujino truly
      disgusted at Shiki, a more potent loathing than before. She says that both
      Fujino and the corpse are not normal, an aberration, when if anything she
      herself is abnormal, considering the way she observes the scene with an
      eyebrow cocked, as if this was the grandest excursion of her life. “No!”
      Fujino declares loudly. “I’m normal, unlike you!” Shiki only responds with
      curious laughter. “Trust me, Fujino, we’re more alike than you know. We’re
      birds of a feather.” “And I don’t believe you.” Fujino’s eyes now fixate
      on Shiki, and soon enough the power she had when she was just a child
      starts to manifest. Her vision of Shiki becomes strangely distorted and
      warped—she need only will it now to make it real. But as suddenly as it
      comes, it fades away and dies. Both of them are surprised: Fujino at her
      ability losing focus, and Shiki at Fujino’s sudden change. “Again?! What
      the fuck is up with you tonight?” Shiki asks, voice rising. She scratches
      her head at the wasted opportunity. “I could’ve killed you right before
      now. Hell, I could’ve done it in the café. What a waste. You’re useless to
      me right now.” After saying thus, Shiki turns on her heels and walks away,
      the sound of her boots starting to echo as she goes farther. “Listen, if I
      were you, I’d cut my losses and go home,” Shiki calls back to Fujino.
      “That way we won’t have to see each other again.” After a few moments, her
      silhouette too, disappears behind a building, leaving Fujino still
      standing dumbstruck at the red carpet of blood. She was back to the way
      she was before. Without pain. She looks down at the corpse again, and
      finds that she can no longer feel what she had felt earlier. The
      wellspring of pain she had felt was again gone, leaving only the memory of
      the crime, and the words of Shiki Ryōgi, echoing like an accusation. We’re
      birds of a feather. “No. I’m different…from you,” she murmurs repeatedly,
      like another curse. How she wished it was true. She hates what she is
      doing, and she trembles at the possibility of having to repeat the process
      just to find Keita Minato, for she truly feels, in her conflicted mind,
      that murder is the most unforgivable of sins. On Fujino’s blood tinted
      reflection on the pavement, a little smile plays across her face.
