    <p>
      As the first rays of sunlight mark the early morning of July 23rd, I
      finally learn the whereabouts of Keita Minato. It definitely took some
      doing: a whole day of asking his friends and acquaintances, and from
      there, his contacts, and then determining his usual turf and narrowing it
      down to the hard-to-find nooks where he could hide. A whole day of good,
      straight-forward street work, in other words, to determine that he had
      apparently made a long vacant room in a run-down six floor apartment tower
      in the uptown projects his new home away from home. Right now, I stand
      outside the front door of this room. A doorbell is affixed beside the
      door, and I am surprised to find that it still works when I press it.
      “Keita Minato,” I call out with a voice loud enough to carry inside. “I’ve
      been looking for you for a mutual friend. Hope you don’t mind me coming
      in.” After a few seconds of waiting with no reply, I try the door, which
      turns out to be unlocked. I walk inside, careful not to make any startling
      noises. I pass a short and narrow corridor before coming to a wider space
      which I can only assume was designed to be the living room, but judging by
      its lack of any object related to a living room, or indeed any object at
      all, casts some doubts on my assumption. No light is turned on, and only
      little cracks in the closed windows illuminate the wooden floor with thin
      streaks of sunlight. The floor creaks with each step, despite my efforts
      to to prevent it. I can see two other rooms from where I am, probably a
      kitchen and a bedroom, though from what I can see, the kitchen is in a
      similar state as the living room, empty and barely lit by sunlight. The
      bedroom door is closed, however, which makes it the first place I search.
      I open the door to the bedroom and enter to find it in absolute darkness,
      the storm shutters on the windows sealing them tight and preventing any
      light from coming in. At the opening of the door I hear a tiny gasp of
      breath from within. Only the bare token of light from the living room
      allows me to see what’s inside: an empty room, like a box, all furniture
      replaced by convenience store food plastic where cockroaches have taken
      residence, a single cellphone on the floor, and a young man, the one who
      gasped earlier, who looks to be about sixteen years of age. “Keita Minato,
      I presume. I have to say, staying cooped up here’ll kill you, not to
      mention the charge you’re gonna get for squatting.” He scrabbles on his
      hands and feet backwards to the wall opposite the door. While it’s only
      been three days since the incident, his face is already thin, almost
      emaciated, with hollowed-out cheeks and bloodshot eyes. It’s obvious he
      hasn’t had a single hour of sleep between now and three days ago. I know
      Gakuto’s friend said that he was taking drugs, but you don’t need drugs to
      turn out like this. The recipe is all in the facts: a bloody tragedy he
      wants to forget, and a need to hide. So he locks himself up in this room,
      shuts the windows tight, waits in the darkness, and hopes for the best…and
      slowly goes insane from the post-traumatic stress while doing so. It’s a
      move of desperation, but it’s worked for him for three days so far. “Who’s
      there?” he says with a quivering voice. I only take two steps inside
      before I stop, careful not to provoke him into rash action. In his current
      state, he’s liable not to trust anyone, so I decide to try just talking to
      him for now to calm him down. “I said who’s there?” he repeats, this time
      with more aggression. I raise my hands to indicate I’m not a threat.
      “Relax, I’m a friend of Gakuto. We were schoolmates back in high school,
      too. Remember anyone named Mikiya Kokutō?” “Kokutō…Mikiya Kokutō? That
      you?” I must be the last person on his mind he ever expected to find him
      here. It takes a few seconds for him to recover from the shock, but when
      he does, he starts to cry. “Wh—why did you come here?” “A favor for the
      big guy. He asked me to go and find you, you know? We’re both worried
      you’ve gotten yourself dragged into something way out of your league.” I
      risk another step forward, but it only makes him shake his head violently.
      “No, nonono. I can’t go out. Not now. I’ll die.” “You’ll die if you keep
      staying here too.” Keita’s eyes widen and start to look at me with slight
      animosity. I produce a cigarette from my pocket, light, then smoke it. I’m
      not a smoker, but it’s a gesture that often makes you look composed and
      makes other people relaxed, obviously something I need right now. “I know
      what happened,” I say while exhaling a puff of smoke. “Keita, you know who
      did it, don’t you?” He keeps his silence. “Then you won’t mind if I just
      talk to you for a while, right?” I say. “On the 20th, you and your friends
      were at the Mirage Bar at night, when it was raining. There’s lots of
      stories about what you’ve all been up to, but I think I can put together
      the gist of it. Don’t worry, the police don’t know yet. Rule of the street
      is that everyone lies to a cop, after all.” Despite me saying this, Keita
      now displays a different type of fear from before, the fear common to all
      who committed a crime that’ll land them on a life sentence or a death
      penalty if they were found out. “Guess what? Someone saw you go into that
      bar that night, and he told me that there weren’t just five of you. You
      had a girl with you, a high school student. I don’t know her name yet, but
      it’s only a matter of time. Now unless she can pull herself up from being
      stone dead, her corpse wasn’t present in that bar when the detectives got
      there. And that girl hasn’t told the cops, and hasn’t been seen since that
      night. Now is there anything you might want to tell me about her?” “I
      ain’t…I don’t know what you’re talking about.” “Fine, then. You did it.
      Expect a wagon in ten minutes.” “Wait—no! I didn’t do it! There’s no way I
      could have!” “Yeah, I thought so. So the girl really was there, wasn’t
      she?” Keita nods after a few moments. “But then we have a different
      problem. We’re looking at something that a girl couldn’t have done alone.
      You sure you weren’t drugged?” “No. We ain’t stoned at the time.” “Keita,
      I don’t need to tell you it’s impossible for a girl to dismember the
      bodies of four guys.” “But that’s what went down!” he shouts indignantly.
      “I ain’t lying. I been thinking she was weird from the start, but man, she
      was crazy! She was like a monster!” His teeth chatter as he covers his
      face with his hands and recalls what happened. “She just stood there, calm
      like, while everyone was being twisted and torn apart. I heard their bones
      snapping and breaking, while I was there scared shitless. When two of my
      friends bought it, I came to my senses and booked it the hell out of
      there. That Fujino Asagami bitch ain’t normal. If I’d stayed there, she’d
      have killed me too!” His voice says it all. It’s all too obvious with
      these sorts of people: a classic case of sudden role reversal between the
      predator and prey. There’s no better way for you to feel the difference
      between the killer and the victim than to become the other one, and Keita
      certainly felt that difference keenly that night. As for his story, well,
      it’s certainly one of the stranger ones out there: a person who can twist
      and bend things just by looking at them. Just a few months ago I would
      have discounted this story as an insane rant at worst and an outright lie
      at best, but since becoming acquainted to Shiki and her newfound Eyes, as
      well as Miss Tōko the mage, I don’t know what I can deny as fictional
      anymore. Putting that aside for now, there’s still one thing that bothers
      me. “All right, I believe this story of yours about this Fujino being the
      killer,” I say. Unsurprisingly, Keita is shocked. “You…you do?” Keita
      stutters. “But anyone would say that’s a fucking lie! Please, say it’s a
      lie and tell me I just snapped and people like her don’t exist!” “Sorry,
      but…well, let’s just say I get to know the strangest people. Don’t try and
      think too hard on it. But what did you mean when you said Fujino was weird
      from the start?” Keita slowly seemed to be slipping into a more stable
      state of mind. His shoulders aren’t so tense anymore. “Ah, yeah…yeah, she
      was weird because…it was like she was lagging behind, you know? Like she
      was actin’ in a play and her reactions was always late. Even when the Boss
      was threatening her, her mug ain’t change one bit. We shoot her up with
      some of the good stuff, and it’s the same story. Even when we beat the
      bitch up she look like she ain’t feeling it.” When I was looking for
      Keita, a lot of the people I asked told me about the girl and how Keita’s
      group had been treating her, but now when he comes out with a confession,
      it leaves me stunned at how brutally they treated her, not to mention how
      casual Keita is about it. What this Fujino girl did is simply her
      long-awaited revenge against those who had been raping her for half a
      year. Had these men been caught and arrested, it is likely they would be
      convicted, but with some of them minors, and others close to that age,
      it’s also highly likely a competent lawyer can cut their sentences down to
      something more manageable than life without parole. Minors like Keita
      can’t even get a sentence without parole. And in a decade or two they’re
      back on the streets. Most police, even the relatively considerate ones,
      would protest such an outcome. Some would say they deserve the noose. And
      this Fujino girl, judging from the ferocity of her murder, would
      definitely feel that that sentence would be the farthest thing from
      justice. But what’s right in your gut and what’s right to the law are both
      bedfellows who sleep with daggers beside them: occasional allies, but more
      often enemies. That’s why there is little to be done about it. “The girl
      looked mighty fine,” Keita continues, “but doing her wasn’t any fun. It
      was like fucking a doll. But—yeah, there was a time when that changed.
      This happened real recent. One of my friends is this crazy asshole who got
      his kicks by beating the shit out of the bitch over and over and seeing
      her not react. He change it up that day; brought a metal bat with him. He
      whacked her upside the back, and her face was like, all twisted up ‘cause
      of the pain. I was actually kinda relieved, you know? Because then I knew
      that you could actually hurt her. I remember that night ‘cause that was
      the one night where she act like a human…to everything we did.” “Alright,
      that’s enough. Shut the hell up.” Holy shit. It was getting harder and
      harder to just listen to this guy without doing something to him. “I get
      what you’re trying to say, so enough, alright? My cousin’s a city cop who
      can protect you. Right now, the lockup is probably the second safest place
      for you. Don’t worry, I won’t tell him anything about what you did.” I
      approach him and urge him to stand up, but it only makes him retreat
      towards the wall behind him even further, his earlier uneasiness
      returning. “No! I ain’t going to no cops and I ain’t going to no court.
      Even then, she’ll kill me if I go out. If I’m just gonna end up in some
      cop’s body bag in pieces, I’ll take my chances here!” “She’ll kill you?”
      That’s a bit weird. If he goes out, Fujino will have to find him first.
      It’s a bit too early to say he’s going to get killed, unless…he was being
      watched. It’s only at that moment that the cellphone on the floor beside
      Keita draws my attention. “Fujino Asagami is calling you, isn’t she?” He
      flinches again at the sound of the name, a sign of his quickly returning
      panic. “Does she know about you being here?” “I don’t know,” he answers
      with a queasy voice. “I had the Boss’ phone when I ran. She called me
      after a while, telling me that she got everyone, that I was next, that
      she’d find me. That’s why I need to hide!” “Why haven’t you dumped that
      phone in the nearest gutter?” I ask, though I think I already know the
      answer. “’Cause she said she was gonna kill me if I threw it away! She
      said if I didn’t wanna die, then I should keep it, ‘cause she was gonna
      let me go as long as I had it!” Uh oh, he’s becoming more and more
      hysterical. “She calls me every night, the crazy little bitch! She said
      she met Akino two days ago, and then Kōhei yesterday. She said she killed
      them in exchange for me. She said ‘isn’t this good for you?’ like she was
      singing it. Said if I value my friends’ lives, then I should come out and
      see her, but why the fuck would I do that, right?” He starts giggling like
      a madman. I can’t imagine what it must have been like for him, getting
      calls every night, the topic always about how another friend died because
      of him. I can almost hear her voice through the phone. I couldn’t find you
      today, so I killed another of your friends in your place. Come out if you
      don’t want any more of your friends to die. It’s fine if you don’t, but
      I’ll keep killing, and sooner or later, I’ll find you. “What should I do,
      Mikiya? I don’t wanna die, not like the others. They were screaming and
      screaming while blood was leaking out of their necks and spilling outta
      their mouths like a towel being wrung!” “You need to start by throwing
      away the phone. She’s doing this to gloat. If she can’t get to your head,
      then her killing anyone is meaningless.” “Ain’t I getting through to your
      head? I can’t! Keeping this phone is my last chance at living!” “She
      killed two people exactly because she knows you’re still keeping it. And
      besides, you’ll end up dead either way if you stay like this, locked up in
      this empty room.” I approached Keita, who at this point had wrapped his
      arms around his legs in a fetal position, and pull him up by the arm. I
      discard my cigarette, smothering it with my shoe. “Mikiya, please stop.
      The end is coming for me, and it probably be best if you left me alone.”
      Then, as soon as he declares this with finality, he recants just as quick
      and offers a new plea. “Oh nonono, I don’t wanna be alone anymore. Please,
      you gotta help me!” The phone calls must have really gotten to his head if
      he’s alternating between two polar thoughts like this. “Don’t worry, I
      will. I’m not giving you over to the police. I’m gonna take you to the
      safest place in the city that I know, trust me.” No one else can shelter
      Keita except Miss Tōko right now. I’ll have to put my trust in her as
      well. With that, I drag Keita out of the apartment and we head as fast as
      we can to Miss Tōko’s end of town.
