    <h1 class="title">Lingering Pain - II</h1>
    <p>
      After my guest leaves as suddenly and unexpectedly as I found her, I try
      to push it out of my mind. She was just a normal girl I found in the
      street and, in a spark of altruism, decided to help. She had some kind of
      pain, though, that much I can be sure, but the how eludes me at the
      moment. Still, no need for me to think on it more than that. She’s gone,
      and there’s nothing I can do about it. More importantly, I’m going to be
      late for work if I don’t hurry. As soon as I finish up my morning rituals,
      I’m out the door instantly. The place I work in isn’t exactly what you’d
      call a “company”, not in any official capacity anyway. My employer is an
      eccentric sort of woman, the kind of woman who buys an abandoned building
      only halfway finished and makes it her office; a woman in her late
      twenties, a collector of old, obscure trinkets, purveyor of ambiguous
      counsel, and all around weirdo, Miss Tōko Aozaki. Ostensibly, she’s a
      maker of dolls and puppets, but she seems to dabble in all manner of
      engineering and architectural work as well. These are, of course, her
      hobbies. I may have complaints about how she runs the place, but she’s
      managed to keep this little enterprise of hers running before I was there
      so she must be doing something right. Besides, I’m not about to challenge
      the wisdom of my one and only source of income, especially when I don’t
      have a degree in a time when actual job pickings are slim. In fact, I
      should consider myself lucky to find any kind of work at all. The
      building, which in the middle of my musings I have managed to reach, is a
      four story structure, with the office at the top. Nestled between the
      industrial district and the housing projects, it projects a feeling of
      emptiness and solitude, like it doesn’t belong. The longer you stare at
      it, the longer you gain this feeling of imposition, and going inside would
      be the last thing on one’s mind. The building lacks modern 21st century
      luxuries such as elevators, so I start to climb the staircase. As I enter
      the room, one person alone sits atop Miss Tōko’s desk, a girl that looks
      decidedly out of place among the stacks of discarded papers and blueprints
      scattered all across the room. The girl in a fish-patterned indigo blue
      kimono turns her head at my entrance, looking at me with listless eyes,
      and I address her. “Wait a minute. Shiki? What are you doing in this
      miserable dump?” “Um, Kokutō? The owner of the place is right behind me,
      pal,” she says in a tone of warning, while pointing behind her with her
      thumb. Shiki moves aside to reveal Miss Tōko seated across the desk, a
      lighted cigarette positioned in her mouth, and sharp eyes burrowing into
      me with pointed glares. She wears the same simple pattern of white blouse
      and black pants, a combination she has upheld so religiously since the day
      I met her that you would think she’d wear the same thing at a funeral. She
      always seems obliged to wear at least one orange-colored accessory though,
      and today it is a single orange earring. “Yeah, I’d say goodbye to your
      paycheck if I were you,” Shiki adds. I gulp. “Hmph. The Lord Tōko Almighty
      forgives you for your transgression since you arrived here earlier than I
      expected. Seriously, Kokutō. I told you there wouldn’t be anything for you
      to do for a while so it’s okay to show yourself around noon, and yet here
      you are.” “Miss Tōko, you know I’m not that kind of person.” I can feel my
      wallet practically coaching me the words in my head. It’s gets a bit
      lonely in there with only the stored value train ticket and phone card
      keeping each other company. “So, why is Shiki in this miserable dump?”
      “Called her in. Thought there was a little business matter she could help
      me with.” For her part, Shiki seemed uninterested and withdrawn. She
      probably went out last night again, since she’s rubbing one of her eyes.
      It’s barely been a month since she recovered from her coma. We still find
      it hard to talk to each other, but we’re taking it slow for now. Since she
      doesn’t seem to be interested in talking to me right now, I sit myself
      down on my desk. With no real work to finish, there’s nothing to do but
      chat. “Did you happen to see the news this morning, Miss Tōko?” “You’re
      talking about the news on Broad Bridge, right? I keep saying it, but Japan
      doesn’t need a bridge that big, goddamit.” What Miss Tōko is talking about
      is none other than the big ten kilometer bridge construction project
      scheduled to finish next year. This part of town is about a twenty minute
      drive away from the city port, a short distance. The port is situated in a
      crescent shaped coastline that forms a bay, and the bridge is planned to
      cross the gap between the extreme upper and lower parts of that crescent
      coastline in one straight highway, supposedly to divert traffic from the
      coast. The city’s development council made a joint venture with some big
      construction company to “answer the complaints of the community.” And of
      course, considering the history of the local government, a public works
      project that big has to have some taxpayer’s money mysteriously
      disappearing into people’s pockets. It’s a typical story: the government
      makes public development projects to answer some new “problem” the
      citizens have, which doesn’t exist except in their heads, and everyone
      gets money. Worse, it’s going to have its own aquarium, a museum, and a
      gigantic parking lot for God knows what reason; you don’t know if the
      place is a bridge or some weird amusement park. The locals had been
      calling it the Bay Bridge since it started, but going from what Miss Tōko
      said, I suppose it’s been officially christened as the Broad Bridge. It
      goes without saying that Miss Tōko and I do not hold this project in high
      esteem. “Well, yeah, you say that, but I thought you already had an
      exhibit space there?” I comment wryly. “That was just a complementary
      ‘thank you’ from the company. If it were up to me, I’d sell it, but how do
      you think it would look for Asagami Construction if I, the designer,
      refused the offer? But it’s a stupid location, and it won’t make me a lick
      of cash.” Uh oh. She’s talking about deficit again. This has to be going
      somewhere I don’t like. I have to find out about this now or else she’s
      never going to give me the money. “Um, Miss Tōko? About the cash. Pardon
      me for being so blunt with it but, you had promised me my salary today
      and—“ “Oh, yeah,” she stretches the word out in a long drawl. “That.
      Unfortunately, I’m going to have to postpone your pay for a month.” She
      spits it out like an unwanted curse, as if I was the one at fault for
      asking in the first place. “But you had a million or some yen wired to
      your account yesterday! How could it all be gone?” “I spent it, how else?”
      Miss Tōko rebuts nonchalantly, sitting in her chair and swiveling it from
      side to side making squeaking noises and adopting the general annoying air
      of feigned ignorance one receives from self-important people. Shiki and I
      just affix her with frustrated stares. “But what on Earth could you spend
      that much money on?” I cry in outrage. “Oh, nothing, just a silly little
      thing. A Victorian era Ouija board to be precise. I don’t know if it works
      or not, but the hundred year value it has makes it fetch a high price. And
      if it’s a numina container, then so much the better. It’ll be a nice
      addition to my collection.” I can’t believe how she’s taking all of this
      in stride. It would have been a lot more convenient if she was just some
      two-bit illusionist with some hand tricks, but her actual sideline is
      being a mage; like, the real deal. Which is why she can talk all about
      esoteric topics such as “numina” or whatnot while keeping a totally
      straight face. And yet she can’t even use her magic to make up some
      convenient excuse for my lack of pay. “Come on, Kokutō, even you couldn’t
      have resisted the bargain price. Don’t be so mad. At least now our wallets
      finally have something in common.” Having been shown by her what miracles
      mages are capable of doing, I was willing to be tolerant in how she
      handled things, but this was way too much. “So that’s it, then? No pay for
      me this month?” “Yep. All employees are to find other means of obtaining
      funding.” I stand up, and make my way towards the door. “Then, you’ll
      excuse me for leaving early, since I’m gonna have to beg, borrow, or steal
      money to get by this month?” “Early in, early out, huh? Just don’t get
      caught stealing or I’ll feel guilty.” Then, she switches to a serious
      tone, as if to indicate the gravity of what she was about to say. “By the
      way, Kokutō. I’ve got a favor to ask you.” Thinking it’s the business
      between her and Shiki, I try to listen as hard as I can. “What, Miss
      Tōko?” Then smiling, she says “Can you spare me some money? I’m pretty
      broke.” I pinch my thumb and forefinger together in front of me and say,
      “This close to resignation.” I close the door with resentment; cutting off
      Miss Tōko’s playful chuckling soon after. After witnessing the amusing
      exchange between Tōko and Mikiya, Shiki at last speaks her mind. “Tōko,
      you were saying before we were interrupted?” “Ah, right. I didn’t really
      want to take a job like this, but money comes first. If only I were an
      alchemist, then I wouldn’t have to worry so much about living expenses.
      Damn Kokutō for not sharing some of that money I know he saves over,” Tōko
      says with indignation. She extinguishes her cigarette on the ashtray.
      Mikiya is probably thinking something similar himself, Shiki thinks.
      “Well, about that incident last night—“ Tōko starts saying. “I don’t need
      to hear any more on that. I get it, for the most part.” “That so? Crime
      scene description only, and you can already read this girl? Sharp one,
      aren’t we?” Tōko looks at Shiki with eyes laden with meaning. Tōko has
      only described the details of the crime scene to Shiki, and yet Shiki
      understands that the girl’s story is writ large all over that vivid scene:
      proof, if anything, of her natural intuition when it comes to these
      matters. Tōko knew she’d understand; they come from the same dirty side of
      the world, after all. “Our benefactor for this job has an idea who the
      target is. If you encounter her, orders are to try and see if she goes
      along quietly. But if she shows any willingness to fight back, any at all,
      then oblige her. ‘Least you’ll see if those blade skills of yours have
      rusted some.” “I see.” Shiki’s only answer. To her, the job was simple.
      Hunt her down, and kill her. “What do we do about the body?” “If you kill
      her, then the client has the means to make this look like an accident.
      Don’t worry about the fallout on this one. She’s dead to the world, as far
      as our client is concerned. Got no moral qualms about killing dead people,
      right?” Tōko gives a little laugh. “So, you in on this? You ask me, it’s
      tailor made for you.” “I don’t even need to answer that.” Shiki starts to
      walk towards the exit. “You’re eager to start. Are you spoiling for blood
      that much, Shiki?” She doesn’t answer. “Hey, you forgot this.” Tōko tosses
      a folder at Shiki. “Some photos and the particulars on her profile. What
      the hell are you going to do without even knowing what she looks like?”
      Shiki doesn’t catch the folder, and it falls harmlessly to the floor. “I
      don’t need a file on this one. You’ve told me where it started, and that’s
      where we’re gonna start too. We’re all the same, us murderers: we attract
      each other. And when me and this girl meet, there’s definitely going to be
      some blood on the floor afterwards.” And with a rustle of clothes, Shiki
      departs from the office, the coldness of her glare the last thing peeking
      in through the small gap of the closing door.
