    <h1 class="title">Lingering Pain - VI</h1>
    <p>
      The rain has made shallow puddles form on the four lane asphalt road of
      the bridge, many of them ankle deep. The raindrops fall in harsh angles
      with no sign of respite, and the wind howls so fiercely, it almost seems
      able to topple the street lamps like weak trees. The sky above and the sea
      below are both fields of total blackness; the lights from the port and the
      city already so far off and unreachable as to seem like looking at the
      moon. A figure can be seen walking in the distance. The black uniform she
      is wearing gives her the appearance of a raven, blending into the night
      and barely visible. Her purple lips breathe heavily with each step she
      takes. When she steps into the light of a street lamp, she comes upon a
      phantom some distance from her, who now speaks. “I finally found you,
      Asagami.” In the midst of the storm’s chaos, the phantom stands, almost
      ethereal in her white kimono. The red jacket worn over it, flapping in the
      wind, looks more like a scarf of blood from a distance. Under the light of
      the lampposts, they look at each other. “Shiki…Ryōgi,” says the raven. “I
      told you, you should have gone home like a good little girl. But you’ve
      tasted blood and found a liking to it. All the killing, all the murder,
      you’re enjoying it, aren’t you?” Though separated by ten meters, and
      dampened by the noise of the wind, their voices carry towards each other
      clearly. “Are you not describing yourself?” accuses the raven. “I find no
      pleasure at all in what I have to do.” Breathing heavily, the raven
      affixes her gaze on the phantom, then covers her face with her left hand,
      the eyes peering out between the fingers shining with hostility and
      murder. In answer, the phantom readies herself, knife on her right hand.
      “Like they say in this country, ‘third time’s the charm.’” The phantom
      makes a bored laugh. The raven will certainly do for tonight. “Ah, how
      alive I feel now. We’re murderers you and I, birds of a feather. Just stay
      the way you are now, and this’ll be quick.” And with those words, the
      phantom and raven both move towards each other, whatever chains holding
      them back now released. In a sudden burst of speed, Shiki starts to sprint
      towards Fujino, her pace seemingly unhindered by the wet asphalt and the
      rain. Only three seconds to close the distance with Fujino, enough time to
      force her fragile body to the ground and drive a knife through her heart.
      But Fujino need only look at her target, and on this score, she has the
      advantage. The three seconds prove to be decisive. A faint light glitters
      in Fujino’s eyes. She focuses on Shiki’s left leg as the axis of rotation,
      and in only a moment, the spell starts to manifest. In that same instant,
      Shiki feels the pull of the unseen hand on her leg, and with an explosion
      of force, jumps quickly to one side, making water splash in the opposite
      direction. But if the spell slackened due to that, it was not to any
      reasonable amount. This spell was no projectile. As long as Shiki remained
      within sight of Fujino, she couldn’t escape it. I may have underestimated
      her, goddamit, thinks Shiki. She runs again, and in an attempt to escape
      Fujino’s line of sight, her path describes a circle around the girl in
      black. “Don’t even think you can esc—“ Fujino starts to say, but is cut
      off when she sees Shiki take her run all the way to the bridge’s guardrail
      and leaps forth and downward. A second or two later, Fujino hears the
      sound of window glass breaking: the roof of the parking lot, right below
      the bridge. “How reckless of her,” murmur the purple, smiling lips. While
      she had slipped away for now, Fujino had kept her vision on Shiki’s left
      hand, and she could swear that she saw Shiki’s jacket sleeve twist. If she
      was right, she had destroyed her arm. “I…am the stronger one,” Fujino
      says, even as the pain in her stomach too grows stronger with her
      proclamation. Taking the ramp and descending back to the parking lot once
      again, she attempts to hold back the pain. Her score with Shiki Ryōgi must
      be settled here, tonight. To Fujino, the parking lot seems darker than
      before. Her eyes are still adjusting to the extreme darkness, and it makes
      navigating her way more difficult than she had expected. Construction
      materials are also stacked and scattered haphazardly all over the place,
      and one or two times Fujino almost slipped and lost footing trying to make
      her way through the convoluted mess. Though only a scant few minutes since
      their first encounter, Fujino has failed to find any trace of Shiki.
      Already, she regrets her decision to follow Shiki down here, as all the
      obstacles make for good cover and concealment for the knife wielding
      woman. Even if Fujino knew where Shiki is hiding, as long as she couldn’t
      actually see her, Fujino’s spell would only hit what Shiki was hiding
      behind. In that brief clash on the bridge, Shiki had already read Fujino’s
      spell, and withdrew to a place where she could have a fighting chance. It
      makes Fujino realize how disadvantaged she is in fighting. Even so, I am
      the stronger one, she thinks. If I can’t see her, then I’ll strip this
      place bare. Randomly, Fujino starts to destroy anything that might offer
      cover. Support pillars, stacks of iron poles, guardrails, wall
      partitions—with each twist and crack of concrete, Fujino’s pain throbs
      faster, and the tremors in the building grow stronger. “Okay, now you’ve
      officially lost it,” resounds a voice in the shadows. Fujino turns toward
      it, the sound seeming to come from behind a pile of construction
      materials. She destroys it in a blink of an eye, only to see Shiki dart
      out of it to the side. Wasting no time, she rushes towards Fujino. “I have
      you!” Fujino exclaims, and sets her sights on the phantom clad in white.
      Shiki continues her charge, her bloodied and battered left arm
      outstretched. There is a moment’s hesitation from Fujino, and then she
      works her spell. With a sickening crunch of ripped sinew and bone, she
      bends Shiki’s already wounded arm, and finally breaks it. But when Fujino
      casts her eyes on Shiki’s neck to finish the job, she finds that the girl
      is but one solid pace from her. Shiki’s knife catches light for an instant
      and glints. She thrusts straight towards Fujino’s carotid artery in a
      graceful, merciless path, the glint on the blade seeming to leave a
      silvery thread as the cold steel travels through the darkness. But Fujino
      saw Shiki smiling malevolently, even while her arm had already been
      viciously destroyed. Terrified at the sight of it, Fujino had moved long
      before Shiki’s thrust had even started, and she was already ducking under
      the knife when it neared her. Clicking her tongue at her miscalculation,
      Shiki recovers from her missed attack, readies her knife for another
      strike, and starts to spring towards the offensive again, but not before
      Fujino recovers from her daze and weaves her spell at Shiki’s torso. “GO
      AWAY!” yells Fujino, unleashing her attack at the same time. Shiki, for
      her part, decides that she missed her chance and evades the point-blank
      blast by a hair’s breadth. It only takes her a leap and a moment’s sprint
      to recede back into the shadows that concealed her well only seconds ago.
      A good opponent: she knows when to retreat. “Is she crazy?” murmurs Fujino
      between deep, ragged breaths; for once not borne from her stomach pain,
      but from the rush of adrenalin and the nervousness starting to set in. Her
      vision darts from shadow to shadow, scanning them for movement. She never
      saw where Shiki chose to hide, and she has no idea when and where she’ll
      choose to strike from again. Fujino feels the nape of her neck, where
      Shiki had almost hit her. As it turns out, the knife had nicked her flesh
      there a little, a wound making itself known when Fujino lightly brushes a
      finger over it. I destroyed her arm, but why didn’t she stop? She keeps
      replaying the moment in her head: how she crushed Shiki’s arm and she kept
      on coming, her eyes, her sadistic grin. Shiki was enjoying this. I’m
      panicking, even though I sent her running, and yet she enjoys herself! It
      almost seemed as if she was actually happy that I destroyed her arm. I’ve
      not enjoyed a single one of my murders, but she’s different. All the
      fighting, all the murder, it must be like a drug to her, and the more
      extreme it is, the more enjoyment she gets out of it. And yet, Fujino
      tries to dispel from her memory how sweet she thought the fragrance of
      blood was on her first murder, how soft the touch of blood on her hands
      were, and how they gave rise to a feeling beyond words that gripped her
      heart. The pain that she felt seemed like life to her, and it only seemed
      logical for her to discover herself in the pain of others. Though it is a
      sensation she has tried to escape since that accursed night, she finds
      that the pain of others stimulates her, as it makes her imagine the pain
      they go through. There is no better thing that makes Fujino feel alive
      than this fascination and feeling of control. But these are thoughts she
      dare not entertain and tries her hardest to deny. If, like me, Shiki feels
      disconnected from her own life, then what does she do to compensate for
      that disconnection? “Ah, fuck, that did not go too well,” utters Shiki to
      herself, out of sight behind a pile of debris that was once a wall,
      courtesy of Fujino’s crude method of searching earlier. The left arm that
      Fujino had twisted was long dead. Shiki had thought that since it was just
      a pile of useless flesh anyway, that she’d use it as a shield and bet it
      all on one decisive attack, but Fujino accidentally gained a new lease on
      life thanks to her unexpected cowardice. Shiki takes off her jacket and
      uses her knife to cut off a sleeve. With some creative application of her
      mouth and remaining arm, she wraps the sleeve around her left upper arm,
      fashioning a crude dressing to stem the bleeding. She can’t feel anything
      from it anymore, and the thought that she might never be able to move it
      again gives her a momentary chill, but also a strangely gratifying
      sensation. Keep it up Asagami! You’ve been handling this fight like a pro
      so far, thinks Shiki. Then again, that sensation just might be her
      consciousness slipping due to rapid blood loss. Well, Mikiya always said I
      was as stubborn as a mule. At the very least, it’ll clear my head some.
      This fight with Fujino is exactly the kind of experience Shiki signed up
      for, a battle where one slight misstep can mean curtains for both of them.
      The excitement Shiki draws from the tension of mortal combat is like a
      drug. And to Shiki, who constantly feels imprisoned in her own unreliable
      memory, this is the only thing that can affirm the small spark of life
      still left in her, and allow her to declare it as her own. Base and primal
      perhaps, but it gets the job done. If Fujino Asagami seeks pleasure in
      murder, as Shiki thinks, then Shiki uses it to feel alive again. Shiki
      listens to the echo of Fujino inhaling, then exhaling…a pause, and then it
      repeats—strained, deep breaths that betray her pain and her trepidation.
      Though Fujino is yet to be injured, her breathing is as labored as
      Shiki’s. In the darkness, the cycle repeats itself, creating a sort of
      metronomic rhythm: they inhale and exhale at the same pace, their hearts
      simultaneously pump blood in their adrenaline-fueled bodies, and their
      thoughts are mutually focused on each other, twins on the swaying cradle
      of the Broad Bridge, rocked and buffeted by the storm. And for the first
      time, Shiki feels some semblance of affection towards Fujino, so much so
      that she feels the need to wring the life out of Fujino with her own
      hands. Even though I know there’s no need for me to, Shiki thinks. She’s
      known since meeting her in the café that she was already damaged goods,
      and quite close to dying outright. There was no real need for her to come
      here and fight her. But that’s how humans live. Shiki thinks back to what
      Tōko said some time ago, that humans are creatures who give meaning to
      meaningless actions, and derive purpose from it. And like this situation,
      some people would scorn it as meaningless, while others would derive
      purpose from it. Where does one begin and another end? You establish your
      own boundary while the consensus of others ultimately determines it. The
      world is full of such empty boundaries. That’s why the ones who get to
      decide where the edge lies are the ones who toe the line: like me, or
      Mikiya, or even Fujino. We aren’t so far from each other, Fujino and me.
      But this place isn’t big enough for both of us psychos. “Another dance,
      then,” Shiki whispers again. “But this time, with my Eyes seeing the
      strings in your special effects magic.” Shaking her head to bring back
      some bit of the consciousness she’s already lost with the blood, Shiki
      stands up. Her right hand holds the knife with a firm grip. If Fujino
      won’t back off herself, then Shiki will just have to eliminate her. Shiki
      reveals herself to Fujino, emerging from behind her cover a stone’s throw
      away. Given that her body temperature is already over 39°C, Fujino can’t
      be blamed for not thinking that her condition isn’t giving her any
      hallucinations. She blinks once, just to confirm that what she’s seeing is
      real. “You’re insane to come out of hiding like that,” Fujino says. She
      wastes no time, immediately focusing her will on working the spell. Her
      vision begins to distort. She wills one axis of rotation each for Shiki’s
      head and legs, and bends. Like cheap cloth, Shiki’s body is torn apart
      into so many bits and pieces. Or at least, it was supposed to be. Before
      any such damage could be dealt, Shiki raises her right arm, and with a
      single slash, excises Fujino’s “distortion.” The points of rotation Fujino
      had created are warded away by the knife, dying as easily as any living
      being. “Things without form are difficult to see,” Shiki begins to say.
      “But thanks to you firing that spell all over the place too much, I can
      finally see it. Your spell’s nimbus is a spiral of green and red. Really
      quite beautiful, if I do say so myself.” Fujino has no idea what she’s
      saying. The only thing she knows right now is the primal instinct of prey:
      if she can’t stop Shiki, she’ll kill her. In her mind, Fujino repeatedly
      utters her pathetic curse, trying to will it into reality. Bend! Bend!
      Bend! Bend! With each repetition, a new manifestation of the spell appears
      in the air in front of Shiki, but she dispels it each time with a swing of
      her knife, and each time the pain in Fujino’s stomach is pushed further
      and further to its limit. “What…are you?” Fujino and Shiki lock eyes.
      Fujino sees only a deep emptiness, and Shiki sees only fear. “There’s a
      flaw for everything in the world,” says Shiki. “Air, intent, and even
      time. Humans need not even be said. If there’s a beginning for everything,
      then there’s also an end. My Eyes see that end, the death of everything.
      And once I see that death, all anything needs is a single, light push,
      that sends it barreling off into entropy. Magic, just like yours.” With
      those sinister Eyes, Shiki glares at Fujino. “That’s why, if there really
      was a God, he would fall just as easily against me.” And with that, Shiki
      runs at Fujino, every footfall barely touching the ground; an ease of
      movement that belied her injured state. As Shiki approaches, she tackles
      Fujino and, sitting on top of Fujino with both legs straddling her body,
      she pins her to the ground. With her executioner now so close to her,
      Fujino’s throat trembles. “Are you…going to kill me?” Fujino asks, her
      mouth quivering. Shiki does not offer a response. “Why are you going to
      kill me? I’ve only killed because I was in pain.” At this, Shiki laughs.
      “Still in denial? Then riddle me this: why are you doing that same smile
      you did back when we last met? Even now, you look like you’re enjoying
      yourself. Why is that?” “That’s impossible.” Fujino almost hesitates to
      say it. Slowly, she places a hand on her cold lips. Without a doubt, it’s
      bent into the rictus of a smile. She tries to remember what her face
      looked like in the puddles of blood borne from her murders. Did they, too,
      reflect a smiling face? I always felt something every time I committed
      murder. Was it happiness like Shiki says? Even when I was violated, I felt
      no pain, so did I turn to murder to pleasure myself? “In the end, this is
      all so much fun to you. You can’t help but be attracted to causing pain,
      and that’s why you’ll never stop suffering. You’d keep killing without a
      reason except for yourself.” “That’s…the answer?” murmurs Fujino. She
      can’t accept it. She doesn’t even want to think about it. I’m different
      from you, she keeps repeating in her mind. But Shiki’s reply destroys
      everything. “Hell, I should know. I said it before, didn’t I? We’re
      similar, birds of a feather.” Shiki raises her knife, and Fujino cries out
      one last, desperate call: a scream, as hard and as strained as she can
      perform at the top of her lungs, for one last pathetic curse. “BEND!” And
      as if in response, the parking lot building trembles with the force of an
      earthquake. In the moment before Shiki’s knife falls, Fujino’s mind
      wanders to the outside, to the raging storm, and the violent waves in the
      bay. Resisting the burning sensation her fever has in her mind, she
      envisions both ends of the bridge, like a view from on high. One axis of
      rotation for either end— And then they bend. A tremor resounds, like
      scores of thunder all happening at the same time. The walls and the iron
      bars inside them groan and scream, while the ground itself cracks and
      tilts in upheaval. Similar cracks slowly snake their way across the
      ceiling, with little pebbles falling away from it. Though the entire
      structure is collapsing in on itself, Fujino can only stare. Shiki had
      been on top of Fujino until a moment ago, when she inadvertently slipped
      when the floor gave way, as if the ground itself swallowed her up. If
      Fujino didn’t move now, the same thing might happen to her. She knew,
      though, that with the athletic ability Shiki had so far demonstrated, it
      is likely she survived. It would only be a matter of time before she
      returned to the chase. Outside is the storm, and below her, the bay.
      Though burning with fever and burdened with a body that seems adamant to
      refuse her mind’s commands, Fujino manages to will herself to stand up.
      Slowly, she begins to walk, extricating herself from the parking lot
      towards the shopping mall, which has so far sustained little damage.
      Still, the once rectangular promenade is now bent in places. It only takes
      her a few steps before collapsing face-down on the floor. It’s taking her
      an enormous effort to even breathe, let alone move her legs. Her head is
      in a daze, and her sight is failing her. The only thing she feels right
      now is the one thing that has been her constant travelling companion: the
      violent pain inside her body. I’m going to die, thinks Fujino for the
      first time in her life. It hurts so much, I can’t take it anymore. If
      living on means enduring this searing ache, then perhaps it’s better to
      just die. Stunned and lying prone on the ground, Fujino coughs, and this
      time, blood comes with it. With her quickly fading vision, only the slow
      spread of the blood she’s vomiting is clearly visible. Red blood, like the
      blood red memory of a time long past: the burning horizon etched in her
      mind, forever lighted by the setting sun. “No, I don’t…want to die,” she
      whispers weakly, fighting her earlier thoughts while reaching an arm out
      in front of her. If her legs won’t cooperate, then her arms will just have
      to do. She makes slow progress crawling on the ground, inch by bloody
      inch, but she is driven forward by her fear of death, and its white
      phantom harbinger. The only sensation that Fujino can feel now is the
      lingering pain. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. That simple declaration is
      the only thing Fujino can bring to mind. Now that she has finally gained a
      sense of pain, ironically, she has grown to detest it. The pain feels like
      a hundred different needles all in her stomach, but Fujino can’t allow
      herself to die now. Not now, when she has done nothing, but so much more
      is left to do. Too pathetic, too empty, too miserable. The needles bury
      themselves deeper, burning her stomach like an acid. She’s losing more
      ground to it every second, clawing at life madly, searching for something
      that can make it easier. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.
      My life, my words, my memories; I want all of them to linger on like the
      pain of a scar. The words echo in her mind, echoing the pulse of the pain.
      It’s the same pain as the one she used to make the other people suffer,
      the realization of which is the most painful thing of all. The weight of
      the blood she has spilled presses so heavily in her mind that she cannot
      even bring herself to an empty apology. Her body convulses, and the blood
      in her throat is the sign of the last gasp of pain. When she vomits the
      blood, her vision, and what little light she sees, starts to sink into
      darkness. Her mind only brings her back to that rain-soaked night, when he
      met him again, and he asked her if her stomach hurt. To that memory of
      him, she speaks the desire she has kept for so long, a thing she wished
      she could have said much earlier. “It hurts—so much…so much that I could
      cry.” And to the memory of her dear mother, she asks a final question.
      “Mother, is it all right for little Fujino to cry?” Alone and in sorrow,
      all Fujino can do is cry, but somehow, doing that eases the pain. He was
      right. You’re not supposed to hold the pain inside, but show it outside.
      I’m glad I met him again, so he couldn’t see me like this. “It hurts,
      doesn’t it?” someone says to Fujino, barely audible at the edge of her
      consciousness. Almost blind, Fujino can only just make out Shiki standing
      next to her, knife still in hand. “If it hurts, then you should have said
      so earlier.” The words ring out like a farewell. Yes, that’s what he would
      have said too. If I could have only said it on that day three years ago,
      if I just let everything out, what could have happened? What path would I
      have taken? I can’t even imagine a better life now. I’ve committed so many
      sins, taken so many lives, all for the sake of my own pleasure, that I
      can’t bring one to mind. Fujino stops her breathing, and in those last few
      seconds, the pain finally fades. She never feels the knife swooping
      downwards, piercing her chest.
