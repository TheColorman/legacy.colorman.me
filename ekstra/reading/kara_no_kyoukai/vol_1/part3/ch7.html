    <h1 class="title">Lingering Pain - VII</h1>
    <p>
      The storm is just hitting the height of its ferocity when I get back into
      town. Braving the rain, I immediately make my way to the office, and when
      I enter, Miss Tōko greets me by accidentally letting the cigarette in her
      mouth fall off because of her surprised look. “Well, that sure was fast.
      It’s only been a day,” she remarks. “As soon as I heard there was a storm
      coming, I came back before they stopped public transportation.” “I…see,”
      Miss Tōko says with apprehension. Her eyebrows are scrunched up in a look
      of consternation. Did something happen? Before that, however, there are
      more pressing concerns she needs to know about. “Ma’am, I’ve checked back
      on stuff about Fujino Asagami, and found out that her pain insensitivity
      is acquired, not congenital. She was normal until she was six years old.”
      “Wait a minute, that can’t be right. Look, if she wasn’t born with the
      damn condition, then it has to be something like syringomyelia, but that
      causes you to have physical complications, which Fujino doesn’t have. A
      rare case like hers where only the pain sensitivity is gone can’t be
      anything but congenital.” “I know. Her doctor said the same thing. Let me
      explain a few things,” I reply. It would be nice to tell her the whole
      story I learned from going to Nagano, but since we don’t have time I’ll
      just have to go over the more important parts, when Fujino was still a
      part of the Asakami family. “The Asakami family, Fujino’s original family,
      was a well-known dynasty in Nagano, but they fell into bankruptcy around
      when Fujino was twelve years old. Fujino’s mother than remarried into the
      Asagami family, a distant branch of the Asakami’s. The Asagami’s, for
      their part, only wanted the Asakami land, and shouldered the debt only for
      that purpose. In her childhood days, Fujino was still sensitive to pain,
      but the people I talked to said she also had a strange power. She could
      make things bend without touching them.” Miss Tōko lights up a cigarette
      and inhales a long one. She sits down behind her desk before waving the
      cigarette at me, motioning me to continue. “She was treated like a demon
      child, and was shunned and even abused by most of the other kids, verbally
      and physically. But when she was around six, the power went out of her for
      some reason, along with her sense of pain.” Miss Tōko narrows her eyes in
      interest, and I see the subtle beginnings of a smile playing at the tips
      of her mouth. “I found out that the Asakamis hired a personal doctor for
      Fujino around that time too, but no one could tell me who he was, and the
      Asakami manor was unoccupied and abandoned, so I couldn’t ask there.”
      “Wait, are we done? Don’t tell me that’s all the dirt you got?” “Patience
      is a virtue, ma’am, so let me finish. I followed up on some police and
      local government records and found him pretty easily. The doctor was a guy
      named Akita. He’s an unlicensed doctor, which I guess is just how the
      Asakami’s preferred it. Took me the better part of a day to pry a story
      out of him.” “See, now you might really get paid this month. When I
      eventually fire you, Kokutō, you might want to consider being a detective.
      I’d even hire you from time to time.” “Gee, thanks,” I reply in sarcastic
      monotone, and then continue the story. “Seems this doctor was more like a
      pharmacist, since he only sold medicine. Asprins, indomethacin, steroids,
      stuff like that. He didn’t know how Fujino became pain insensitive either,
      because apparently the father did it himself.” “Wait, what do you mean?
      That Fujino’s father cured her by himself, or administered the medicine by
      himself?” A subtle difference, one I recognize by nodding my head. “The
      latter, of course. The father apparently had no intention of curing Fujino
      of her pain insensitivity, but the doctor diagnosed her all the same. He
      said the possibility of her having something called ‘neuromyelitis optica’
      was high.” “Neuromyelitis optica…Devic’s disease, huh?” “I’m sorry ma’am,
      but you’re going to have to enlighten me on this one.” “It’s a type of
      myelitis, and another disease where your senses slowly go numb, apart from
      weakening your legs and a gradual degradation of eyesight, all the way
      until you’re blind. They usually give you steroids early on to treat it,
      and indomethacin to lessen the pain.” Miss Tōko giggles lightly, the same
      kind of laugh she always does when she comes up with a solution to a
      difficult problem. It’s always a bit scary, kind of like the professor I
      talked to yesterday. “Now I see. Yeah, no wonder she became like that.
      Hers isn’t congenital or acquired, but something artificial. She was made
      to lose her sense of pain. I see what that family tried to do now. Exactly
      the opposite of what the Ryōgi dynasty does.” I try to brace myself for
      the wave of half-monologue, half-dialogue that she is inevitably entering,
      and ask for more clarification. “So what exactly is this ‘indomethacin’
      stuff?” “A drug for pain relief. See, whatever kind of wound you get, you
      get pain, and it’s a reaction to outside influences that are impeding you.
      Your body produces some chemicals that stimulate some nerves that send a
      signal to your brain saying ‘Oh my God, I am going to die,’ and that’s how
      you get pain. Aspirins and indomethacin work by controlling your
      prostaglandin production, and in turn your arachidonic acid, which
      sensitizes your neurons to pain. A large enough dose of indomethacin can
      basically take away your pain.” Miss Tōko says all of this in almost one
      breath, and her face has that rare look of enjoyment that she finally has
      an opportunity to explain all of this. Honestly, though, these
      “arachidons” and stuff all sound like dinosaur names, and it’s really all
      Greek to me. “So in other words, it’s medicine that numbs you to pain,
      right?” “Well, not exactly,” she replies. “Opioids would probably be much
      better. Stuff works like endorphins in your brain: gets you right up, and
      makes your central nervous system work smooth as butter, but—” I glare at
      her sharply to indicate that she should probably hold back on explaining
      more medical terms. “Oh…well, we’ll leave that subject alone for now, I
      guess. Point is, Fujino’s father knew that her power was tied to her sense
      of pain, and he wanted to block it I suppose, but Fujino’s capability for
      sensation had to go with it. That’s why the father made Fujino OD on
      painkillers. Quite unlike the Ryōgi dynasty, who until this day still
      perform tireless rituals to get heirs close to magical potential. Sadly,
      the only result is that Fujino’s power wasn’t snuffed out, only suppressed
      for a time, and now it’s coming back in a big way. Kind of like when the
      mages around northern Africa sew their eyes shut, the paradigm being that
      it prevents mana from ‘leaking out’, except with Fujino it’s possibly less
      disturbing.” Surprisingly enough, I recognize some of what Miss Tōko is
      saying. The same dubious rumors circulated when I was in Nagano: of the
      old Asakami family occasionally producing children who, like the professor
      put it, played an entirely different card game. These children, born with
      supernatural capabilities, were shunned. So they finally resorted to
      medicines to artificially dull the pain, and the powers. “The worst part
      is how she can never go back to normal,” I respond. “Whether she’s taking
      the medicine and loses her power, or not taking them and getting the
      powers back. The professor you referred me to called her a ‘living
      paradox’, because she doesn’t have the necessary subconscious ability to
      assimilate experience like others do, like you said, and so she can’t
      sympathize with anybody. If only she was still pain insensitive at on that
      night, then just maybe she wouldn’t have started to kill.” “Come now,
      let’s not denigrate pain,” Miss Tōko says, cutting me off. “You blame one
      thing, you make sure it’s the wound. No matter how much it hurts, we need
      pain. Do you think you pull your hand out of the fire because it’s on
      fire? No, you pull it out because it’s hot and it hurts. If we didn’t have
      pain, we wouldn’t pull our hands out until it’s a smoldering stump. Just
      look at Fujino Asagami, who, as soon as her sense of pain returned from
      being struck in the back, proceeded immediately to defend herself. For the
      first time, she recognized those people were dangerous, and were hurting
      her. Still, killing them might have been going a bit too far.” “Ma’am, my
      question from the last time we met still stands. Isn’t there anything we
      can do to help her? Can’t she be cured?” “A wound you can’t cure only
      means death. Unfortunately, I think that’s the case we’re dealing with
      now.” Sometimes I really have no idea how Miss Tōko can say things like
      that. She just put a human life on the spot, and here I am thinking she
      can still be saved, if only we understood the nature of her pain, if only
      we— “Kokutō, I’m going to say it once more, with feeling. Hers is the kind
      of pain that can no longer be healed. Well, it’d be more accurate to say
      that she wasn’t wounded from the start.” “Wait, I’m…not sure I know what
      you mean.” “Tear your mind away from trying to be the good guy for a
      second and think about the wound itself. When was the last time you heard
      a deep stab wound fix itself up in two days?” “Well, sure that’s true,
      but…” Wait. If what she’s saying is true, then haven’t we been operating
      from a mistaken perspective all this time? I must have the most puzzled
      look on my face since Miss Tōko is covering her mouth with a hand, barely
      holding back her laughter. “While I applaud you for researching Fujino
      Asagami’s past, you neglected looking up what she’s been up to in the
      present. She’s been seeing a doctor in the city for a month or two now,
      but she’s neglected to show up in the past twenty days.” “Whoa, wait a
      minute. A doctor, here in Tokyo?!” Miss Tōko cocks an eyebrow in surprise.
      “Kokutō, you’re good in investigation and following a lead, but you miss
      out on some of the most obvious things. The thing that people insensitive
      to pain are most scared about is something wrong going on in their bodies.
      Lacking pain, they don’t have the benefit of an early warning system on
      most of the weird hijinks a body can get into, so they go visit a doctor,
      much more often than an average person, just so they can get a look-see.”
      I have to admit that I missed that one, so driven was I to find out
      anything in Fujino’s past that might tell me something about her
      motivations. Fujino acting in secret means that, at the very least,
      Fujino’s parents don’t know what Fujino has become now. “To bring us back
      to Fujino and the mystery of her wound,” Miss Tōko begins again. “Fujino
      killing her abusers was the result of a simple misunderstanding, Kokutō.
      Those boys forced Fujino down, and their leader brought out a knife.
      Fujino thought she was going to get stabbed—and she really was going
      to!—but she had already recovered her sense of pain at that point, and she
      probably unconsciously used her power. Between the stab and the twisting,
      Fujino’s was faster. What I’m seeing is that she twisted the head off of
      that guy like a fucking screw, and the blood spatter struck Fujino, making
      her think she was stabbed.” I shake my head, trying to rid my mind of the
      visceral images Miss Tōko’s story is conjuring up. “There’s something
      wrong with that story. If Fujino’s sense of pain had returned, then she
      wouldn’t make that misunderstanding. There wouldn’t be any pain if she
      wasn’t really stabbed.” “Fujino was in pain from the start, really,” Miss
      Tōko immediately replies. “I made the doctor that Fujino saw recently show
      me her clinical records. She’s has chronic caecitis, more commonly known
      as appendicitis. The pain in her abdomen isn’t from a knife, but from
      inside her body. If her sense of pain returned right before she was
      stabbed, the pain in her stomach told her mind that she was already
      stabbed. It must have happened so fast, Fujino was confused. Having been
      raised for most of her life not knowing pain, she didn’t even check to see
      if she actually was stabbed, because she didn’t have the experience of
      hurting real bad before, and the steps that people normally take in those
      situations. She’d look at her stomach and interpret the lack of a wound as
      a sign that it was already healed.” “So it’s all just one big
      misunderstanding?” “The wound itself is. But it doesn’t change the facts:
      Fujino’s been pushed over the edge. Ignoring whether or not she was even
      stabbed, the fact that the leader had brought a knife that night meant
      that he was serious about killing Fujino. The only way she could have
      escaped that bar was to kill them. Unfortunately for Fujino, Keita Minato
      escaped. If everything was settled on that night, she might not have gone
      this far.” Miss Tōko snuffs out the cigarette she’s smoking and reaches
      into her pack for a fresh one. “Like Shiki said, she’s beyond help now.”
      “Both of you keep saying that, but why is she?” I say, anger rising in my
      voice. “Shiki was probably talking about the mental side of things.
      Fujino’s quest for revenge against the five people who violated her is,
      while murder, still somewhat justifiable. She crossed the line when she
      started killing people unrelated to that incident. It’s the lack of any
      sense or reason behind it that truly made Shiki after Fujino’s blood.
      Despite having a taste for murder, I think Shiki still understands the
      weight of death, and the toll murder takes on someone. Notice how she
      doesn’t just slaughter people on the street willy-nilly. Fujino indulged
      her more primal passions, and Shiki can’t forgive her for that.” Is Fujino
      really indulging, I wonder, or is she just running away? Miss Tōko
      continues: “That’s Shiki’s reasoning, but I’m talking how she’s ‘beyond
      help’ physically. Appendicitis, when left alone, can rupture your appendix
      and cause peritonitis. The inflammation results in extreme pain, probably
      comparable to being stabbed with a knife. Then you start getting fevers,
      cyanosis, shock from low blood pressure, all that good stuff. When it
      reaches the duodenum, you can die in half a day. It’s already been five
      days since the night of the 20th, and the appendix should long have
      ruptured now. Sad, but it’s terminal—she’s gonna bite it.” She says it
      clinically, with all the weight and delicacy of someone reporting on a
      science class. I’ll never be able to understand how she does that. “Maybe
      if we hurry, we can still find her and—“ “Kokutō, the client for this job
      is Fujino Asagami’s father. The patriarch of the Asagami family told me
      himself. They can’t risk a scandal like this leaking out to the public,
      not with their well cultivated business reputation on the line. The father
      must’ve known the family secret, and recognized the true nature of the
      incident on the bar as Fujino’s doing. He hired us to take her out, a
      ‘monster’ by his own words. Strange, isn’t it? The father is supposed to
      shelter their daughter. But now he’s the one taking a check out of his
      wallet to let us kill her. The world really is against her.” She concludes
      with a long, exasperated sigh. “We finish this job tonight. Shiki already
      left.” Unbelievable. I tried to stop this, but now it’s actually
      happening. “Son of a bitch,” I utter inadvertently. Whether it is directed
      to myself, Miss Tōko, Shiki, Fujino’s father, or Fujino herself, even I
      don’t know.
