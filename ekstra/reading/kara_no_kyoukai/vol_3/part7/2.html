    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - II</h1>
    <p>
      - May. - - I need to write about her again. - - I lose myself when I see
      her, drinking her presence in. My fingers become numb and I forget to
      breathe at the sight of her. Can I die from doing so? I need only look at
      her, and she buries herself again in my mind like a virus. She’s invaded
      my life. Got deep inside, this miraculously perfect girl from my high
      school. I think I’ve fallen in love. I’ve never even talked to her, never
      even heard her voice. And that emptiness weighs more on me every day, so
      much that I’m scared. - February 9. The rain stopped sometime last night,
      and the city once again welcomes daylight, albeit filtered through a
      cloudy grey canopy that the rain managed to leave as a parting gift. I was
      up until late last night canvassing the crime scenes for clues, and I was
      so tired I decided not to go home and just crash at my old high school
      friend Gakuto’s place, which was nearer. Good thing he was very
      accommodating. Now, despite my lack of sleep, I can’t seem to shake off my
      custom of waking up early, but stuck with nothing to do, I spend the time
      looking out the window and looking at the dawn slowly creeping over the
      rest of the city. “You up early, ain’t ya? Maybe you’re looking to fix me
      some morning chow?” It’s Gakuto, awake now and rubbing his eyes. Of
      course, I decline his polite request. “In your weirdest dreams. Besides,
      there’s nothing but beer in your fridge. I can’t work miracles, you know.”
      “Hah, sharp as ever, Mikiya. Time to bang on my neighbour’s door and see
      if they have some grub to eat,” he concludes with a yawn. I watch him get
      up, scratch his head, and look at me for a moment, to which I muster my
      best look of disappointment. Then, still groggy, he struggles to reach the
      door, before doing a very slow double take on me, his eyes now as
      surprised as if he had seen a ghost. “Ever take note of how pale you are
      at the moment?” he says to me. “You sure you feeling okay?” Frowning, I
      take a look at myself at his mirror. He’s right. I’m as deathly pale as a
      doll. “Don’t worry. It wears off after a while. Acid only takes about four
      to six hours. Might be having some hallucinations and random synaesthesia
      until then, though. Should be interesting.” “Someday, you’re curiosity’s
      gonna make you end up face down in a gutter somewhere.” “But it hasn’t.”
      “Give it time,” he smiles. “So, you curious enough to try out what’s being
      passed around on the corners these days,” he observes, looking over at the
      remnants of my fix last night. Some blotters the size of stamps, and some
      rolls of weed still remain unused, scattered above his table. I nod. “The
      weed you can throw away. The acid…well, I’m done with that, but you can
      have them if you want. It’s not addictive, if that’s what you wanna ask,
      and it’s definitely got to be more fun than the poor excuses for amusement
      parks we have here.” I grab the coat which I hastily hurled on top of the
      bed last night, and quickly put it on. It’s still 7am, and the city should
      just be beginning to breathe again. I don’t have time to be leisurely
      anymore. “Heading out already? Stay for a while, man. You can’t even stand
      up correct, let alone walk,” Gakuto says. “Can’t. Got things to find out,”
      I answer, surprised at how weak and throaty my voice comes out. “Oh yeah?
      Like what?” I point to Gakuto’s TV. “Watched the 6am news a bit earlier.
      Seems last night, behind this love hotel called Pavillion—” “The one with
      high prices for them suit-and-tie motherfuckers?” Gakuto asks,
      interrupting. “Yeah, that one. Apparently the murderous monster killed
      some more people in the alley behind it. This time’s different, though.
      News said four people all at the same scene.” Gakuto hums, a sound of
      curiosity, before turning on the television. Predictably, it’s all morning
      news programs, and will be for a little while longer. The content is
      unsurprising. The murderous monster again, and the subject is just as I
      told Gakuto. There is one new point of interest in this report he’s
      watching, and that’s— “The suspect is dressed in a kimono? How about that,
      huh?” Gakuto asks, keeping his eyes glued to the TV. I shake my head,
      leaving the remark hanging in the air as I continue walking towards the
      exit to his apartment. Though I’m better off than I was just an hour ago,
      I’m still a little shaky as I put on my shoes. As I do this, Gakuto walks
      up behind me, seeing me out. With his hand holding the two drugs I left
      behind on his table, he starts to ask a question before I leave. “So
      what’s it like taking both of these at the same time?” “Can’t say it’s a
      glowing review. You only get what Hansel and Gretel felt.” With that, I
      stand up and open the door, waving my hand behind me before leaving his
      apartment. I don’t bother to turn around to see if he waves back. It’s
      only when I’ve stepped outside into the sun and closed the door behind me
      that I begin to feel the pang of hunger. I haven’t eaten for a day. And
      the munchies from the weed is no doubt only making it worse. It takes me
      an hour to walk from Gakuto’s place to the crime scene that I saw on the
      news this morning. Nothing is out of place when I get there. Blue
      uniformed policemen are keeping a tight perimeter around the entire place,
      and aren’t allowing anyone to get near. And of course, rubberneckers are
      there as well, trying to get their fair share of an unusual sight. Between
      them and the police blocking the entrance to the alley crossroads, I can’t
      catch sight of anything useful inside. I think about going to the Pavilion
      love hotel nearby, but then I consider that it would probably be a waste
      of time. There wouldn’t be a receptionist to talk to, and whatever
      personnel certainly wouldn’t even consider talking to me. And like hell
      they’d show me their security camera footage. And anyway, even if Shiki
      did make a stop at that hotel, she wouldn’t be there now. So I decide to
      come at this from a different angle. I came into contact with a particular
      drug slinger right around this neighbourhood when I was trying to find a
      friend of Gakuto’s back in July, and I was tracing his whereabouts back to
      his usual slingers. I only ever got a cellphone number, so the phone is
      the only extent of our interaction, but I talked to the person before and
      that was enough for me. I find a pay phone nearby and call up the person
      up, asking for a meet to get some new information. There is a silence on
      the other end of the line for a few seconds before the person gives his
      consent. Then I make my way over to the address. It leads me to a place
      far from the noise of the city’s main avenues, outside of the commercial
      district. Here, old buildings crowd around each other, poorly zoned and a
      testament to what the economy had left behind. The apartment building I
      arrive at is an old, run-down place, the dirt of years that cling
      stubbornly to it making the color of the place darker than it was
      originally intended to be. It was obviously long abandoned, the front
      entrance having been boarded up. The address I have says to go to the
      second floor, however, so I look around for a fire escape. Soon enough, I
      find one, though it is missing a few steps and the rust has long overtaken
      it. I climb it, each footfall sounding on steel, and careful to watch each
      for a sign of dangerous collapse. When I get to the second floor landing,
      I find the door leading to the apartment’s common hallway unlocked. I step
      inside, quickly finding the room I’m looking for, and knock. Beyond the
      door I hear the sounds of footsteps, and the movement of shadows under the
      little stab of light emanating from under the door. This lasts for a few
      seconds before the wooden door finally opens slightly, and a person sticks
      her head out. It is the face of a woman, her long brunette hair sweeping
      down from behind her head. At first glance, she looks to be only a few
      years older than me. She looks me up and down, slipping me a visible smile
      before opening the door the entire way. She is dressed unremarkably, with
      only her red winter coat as a characteristic feature. “Hey. I’m the one
      who called you this morning—” “Yeah, yeah, I know. Hope nobody followed
      you. Wouldn’t want anybody to know someone’s living in here. Get in here,
      quick.” Suddenly, she reaches out and takes my arm, pulling me into her
      room forcibly. I spend a moment trying not to stumble, and find myself
      inside a very messy room. Clothes and magazines and other assorted things
      have claimed possession of the floor, and in the middle of all of it is a
      kotatsu. The woman walks past me, quickly sitting down and slipping her
      legs inside the kotatsu. She gives me an impatient glare, motioning her
      head for me to come near her. And so, a bit more timidly then I’m used to,
      I sit down on the floor across from her. The kotatsu isn’t warm at all,
      however, and I notice that it isn’t connected to an outlet. Probably
      because there isn’t even any electricity in here. “So this is what you
      look like, huh?” she says in a high voice. She rests her hands on the
      table, and her head on her hands, tilted sideways so that she has to look
      up at me awkwardly. “Didn’t really expect you to look the way you are.” I
      want to answer that it’s entirely the same with me, but I hold off on it.
      She’s acting a lot different than the two curt conversations we’ve had on
      the phone have led me to believe. I don’t know how she slings her product,
      but— “Oh, it’s easy. Nobody really gives a hoot if you’re a guy or a girl,
      as long as you got the product.” “Err, yeah, I suppose,” I manage to
      stutter out. “How did you—” She chuckles. “You’re an easy book to read,
      and it’s written all over your face, you know? Still, though, I could
      swear from your voice on the phone that I had you pegged as some kind of
      reptilian look-type guy. Complete with widdle spectacles, ‘information is
      power’-type college boy. Well, guess it doesn’t matter in the end. So,
      what was it you wanted to ask?” She blinks, then narrows her eyes. In that
      instant, though she did not move at all, I could feel something change in
      how she carried herself, almost like a switch has been turned on in her
      mind. Trying to ignore the feeling, I press on with my first question. I
      clear my throat. “I guess I’ll start with what happened last night. Heard
      anything to the effect of witnesses to what went down with the murderous
      monster last night?” “You mean the wild girl in the kimono with a leather
      jacket?” she says. The sentence catches me so off guard that I’m forced to
      avert my eyes from her. If she’s as sharp as she claims, she’d have
      probably noticed that too. She continues, “Don’t need to ask anyone else
      about that. I mean, I saw it after all. Let’s see now…I think it was
      around 3am last night? The rain didn’t seem to want to stop. This place is
      scary in rainy nights, and business has kinda sucked lately, you know? But
      that love hotel is a constant customer. They buy from me all the time. I
      was going out to make my delivery, and I passed by the entrance to the
      alley, and then I saw them. Four youngins, trying to mug a broad in a
      kimono. Shameless, I tell ya.” There is a playful thoughtfulness to her
      eyes now as she recounts last night’s events, and before long I find my
      eyes meeting hers again. “The news says the suspect’s gender is
      unconfirmed. How do you even know she’s a girl?” “Trust me, I’d know.
      Ain’t no better judge for a girl’s body than another girl, is there? That
      said, it was pretty dark,” she furrows her brow, as if trying hard to
      remember, then, “Wait, do you know this girl?” She raises her head now,
      and looks at me straight. I bite my lip. No answer. “Fine. Nothing to do
      with me, I guess. I was hoping this would be an info trade and not just me
      giving and you taking, you know? My advice, though? You should probably
      drop her like a bad disease. She’s not normal. I’ve been friends with
      dangerous people my entire career, and I know how crazy it can get. I’m
      friends with more than a few junkies, but they’re pretty safe as long as
      you’re not a dick. What I’m really afraid of is people like her. “She was
      something else. Four youngins got her surrounded, but she was at them
      easy-like. She had a knife, right? And then she was just dancing around
      them like a ballerina, swinging at them, but never enough to seriously
      hurt them. But it wasn’t to avoid killing them, that’s for sure. It felt
      more like she wanted to stab them over and over again. Like she
      was…enjoying herself. The dope fiends eventually got tired, or maybe the
      pain was getting harder to ignore, so they started to run. It didn’t
      matter. The girl was faster. She jumped on them, killing three with a stab
      on the back. Why she waited until then to finish them off, I wouldn’t
      know. It went especially bad for the fourth guy she cornered. Guy had his
      face to the ground, crying and pleading for his life, but the woman didn’t
      waste any time, and planted the knife straight to his neck. Then she just
      stood there for a long time, doing nothing except standing in the middle
      of all the carnage. I saw her eyes then, glowing for some reason in the
      middle of all that dark. A deep blue light. Like nothing else I’ve seen, I
      swear. I wanted to scream, but it wouldn’t come out. A good thing, looking
      back on it. She would’ve chased me down and stuck me like she did those
      four guys if she’d heard me.” She says all of this with no gesture or
      gesticulation, just her eyes looking up at mine, affixed there as she
      tells her story. It tells me that she isn’t lying at all. “Something
      bothers me about that, though,” I finally say after a full five-second
      delay. “You say you were hiding at the corner of the alley and the
      sidewalk, where you could only see silhouettes. How could you even know
      that the cuts weren’t that deep? Or the state of the bodies?” She grins.
      “You’re right. I don’t have solid proof I can show, and I can’t tell you I
      was near close enough to tell you about how bad the cuts on the guys were.
      It’s just the gut feeling I got, and some healthy assumption. Which is why
      I didn’t take this to the cops. But if you want to find some other
      witness, then you’re welcome to try.” “So it’s safe to say that you
      probably couldn’t truly tell what gender the suspect was.” She concedes me
      a tired shrug. “Whatever you say, chief. Again, I just know from looking.
      I could tell what she was wearing well enough though. It’s a kimono, like
      the news says, but it had a jacket worn over it. Couldn’t see the sleeves,
      see? In fact, without the sleeves, the kimono looks more like a skirt that
      way. Funny how that is, huh?” “Yeah,” I mutter absentmindedly, “really
      funny.” Something is off about all this. All of it seems like the facts
      are too controlled. The manner of death coming to light first, making the
      city remember the entire affair that ended three years ago. Then the
      frequency of the murderous monster’s actions increasing exactly after this
      was exposed, paralyzing the city. Then showing his general appearance. All
      orderly, engineered. Almost like— “Almost like a game, yeah?” The woman
      says with a tired wave of her head. I look at her, eyebrow raised, and she
      shoots me back a catty smile as she rests her head back on the kotatsu.
      “We done here? Cause there’s not a lot more I can tell you about last
      night, you know.” I can’t muster a reply. I feel like there’s more to ask.
      I keep repeating in my head how she was in the dark, unable to see very
      well in the heavy rain. I keep thinking that she’s wrong that she saw a
      kimono. Inside, I keep saying to myself that it isn’t Shiki. But laying
      out the facts before me makes me expect the worst. It’s just like three
      years ago, then. I need to keep believing. I haven’t even seen anything
      with my own eyes yet. “Yeah, I guess that’s enough about what happened
      last night.” I say, as much to her as to myself. “I still have some
      questions, though. This might be a weird question but, this was the first
      time there was a witness for the crime, wasn’t it? I mean, especially
      since there’s been a new body every day for the past week, and they
      weren’t exactly happening in deserted places. Unlike three years ago, the
      murders today all took place downtown, and it’s kind of weird that there
      hasn’t been anyone that’s stumbled on the crime as it was happening before
      now, or seen anyone strange wandering around.” “Mmm, I guess so, now that
      you mention it. But if you’re asking if anyone I know has seen it just
      like me, then I’d have to guess no. Most of the bodies were dropped at
      places that we don’t really cover. Besides, as a rule, it’s not like
      slingers and junkies like to talk to cops anyway. And if you’re going to
      talk about strange personalities walking around, well, have you taken a
      good look at us? We walk around town and we’re considered strange. And
      people who wear kimonos tend not to go near us, if you catch my drift. I
      mean, who even wears kimonos these days? Wealthy old maids or something,
      am I right? Kind of strange to catch someone like that buying drugs from
      us, yeah?” She repeats the word “strange” in a whisper, as if muttering
      some kind of code to the table. “Still, that makes you the first one to
      see the whole thing being done. The murder I mean. Don’t you find that the
      least bit odd?” She scratches her head, getting visibly annoyed. “What
      about it? No witnesses means no witnesses, and that’s that.” “But with no
      one to see it, it’s like a sealed room mystery, and that removes all
      meaning from it.” “Wait, whoa, what? Sorry, I’m kinda slow, mister college
      boy, so you’re gonna have to cut me some slack. If it’s a sealed room
      murder, then isn’t that a good thing? Police never find the body and you
      never get caught.” “Then it’s not the kind of murder our suspect wants. As
      far as the people outside the room know, no crime has been committed
      inside the room. And in fact, a sealed room killer wants this, so as to
      bother people as little as possible. It’s the entire point of it. When
      there’s no way to get inside the room, the murder begins to look like
      suicide. When people think of murder, the suspect’s going about the whole
      sealed room thing the wrong way. The thought of a suspect should be the
      last thing on your mind. But this murderous monster wanted to be found.
      Hence the locations he chose. Open, well-trod, in the busy portions of the
      city; far from being a sealed room. And yet, no convenient witnesses to
      him.” The woman hums an affirmative and nods her side-lain head. “But you
      do have a witness. Me.” “I know. But if this murderous monster wanted to
      show off, then a witness would have long ago surfaced.” My theory, however
      rough, is all I have to go on. If I follow where it goes, then the next
      matter is simple. The fact that a witness was present last night means it
      was different. Maybe it was unplanned, not truly a part of the great
      architecture of his work. “I think I’m getting it,” says the girl
      probingly. “So you’re thinking that the lack of witnesses on the other
      murderers had a reason. And that because I’m a witness now means he could
      have screwed up somewhere.” She crosses her arms lazily and furrows her
      brow, as if she’s just now parsing what I said. “You’re pretty smart,
      college boy, though you could stand to get better glasses. So where are
      your thoughts stringing you along now?” “I…don’t know just yet,” I mutter
      hesitantly. Annoyed, I look up to think. What else is there to think
      about? My hypothesis and…that’s that. Suddenly, the girl, who still kept
      staring at me with narrowed eyes, broke out into laughter. “Ah, silent
      type now, yeah? You guys do have your reasons, I suppose. So what’s yours,
      I wonder? Out to prove the innocence of this girl, hmm?” “There’s a lot of
      stuff to be proven first before that. Like this new cocktail package
      getting popular. Anything you can tell me about that?” “Ah, it all comes
      back to this, eventually.” She gives me a sidelong glance, her eyes
      somehow bolder now more than sly, and it seems to me that even the air of
      the room changes with it. “I’m assuming it’s the acid and weed combo
      you’re talking about. Normally, that combo is called a ‘mudra,’ but that’s
      not the same as the cocktail going around now. Not even close. That shit
      is fierce, buddy. One dip and you’re gone, same as the rest of them. Start
      taking it every day, and it’ll kill you in no time flat. I don’t know what
      kind of kick people get out of that.” “Is that so? I’ve tried LSD and
      marijuana before, but all I got was nausea and the munchies, then it just
      went down to the kind of level you’d expect.” “Going around town and don’t
      know the first thing about drugs, do you?” She does a little tut tut
      before continuing. “Totally not a good idea. All right, let’s school you
      college kid. Thing about drugs is your body can have a resistance to it.
      If it’s weak stuff, you might end up taking more and more of it every
      time, and emptying your wallet in the process. Not the way to go, right?
      Then there’s dependency. There’s physical and mental sides to it, but to
      be simple, it’s how hard it is for you to deal with when you don’t get
      your regular juice. The stronger it is, the more frequent you start to
      take it. Ah well, it all starts with the person anyway. Easier for someone
      hopped up on acid to stop than it is for a smoker, oftentimes. Ask me,
      alcohol, smokes, and coffee are larger problems. Why drugs are illegal and
      those aren’t is what I wanna ask.” I have to say, her little rant at the
      end makes me chuckle a little bit. Luckily, enough, she doesn’t notice.
      Not that I think she’s wrong or anything. She’s probably right. But I like
      how she just suddenly flew into it out of nowhere. It takes her a moment
      to calm down before she continues. “Well, fine, I guess it’s true there
      can be drugs that are designed to make you so physically dependent, it can
      do some real damage to your body. On principle, I don’t sell that stuff.
      That’s why I’m not so good with the guys selling the Bloodchip. Don’t know
      any, and I don’t wanna meet any.” “Bloodchip?” I say. She nods. “Street
      name of the new cocktail. It’s a special one, that. Two blotters, mixed in
      with ten grams of weed will cost you only this much!” she says in an
      exaggeratedly excited tone. Then she raises a finger, a single finger. A
      thousand yen. Now, other countries have always priced their narcotics
      higher than we do in Japan, but this is ridiculous. Even a middle school
      kid would have very little trouble coming up with the money to buy
      regularly. “Damn. That’s like fast food prices now.” “Yeah, and getting
      lower, too. They get people addicted, and then they lower the price. What
      the hell is up with that? I mean, that’s just bad business sense, isn’t
      it? That’s some dirty undercutting that even the yakuza don’t do. And it’s
      even worse than the stuff out there on the street. It might be some really
      pure LSD , I don’t know. All I know is, it’s getting more popular every
      day. What’s weird is that you take it orally, right? But then it’s more
      effective than shooting yourself up with dope. Never tried it, though.”
      “Is this a well-known fact?” “Of course. It’s how the trade goes.
      Surprised to hear you don’t know it, actually, seeing as you’re apparently
      in the market. Though the connect for the Bloodchip only uses children to
      sling his stuff, so I guess that limits how the knowledge gets passed
      around. Street level guys know about it, but the lieutenants don’t give a
      damn. All of them think it’s just some stupid children’s game, probably.
      Guessing that’s also why the cops don’t have an angle on it just yet. They
      keep targeting the big name yakuza groups, but never the independent
      merchants like me. We’re just too high class for them.” She laughs again,
      a cheerfully mocking noise. I on the other hand, only have what she told
      me to darken the mind. The dealer I got my drugs from never told me about
      this new one. I tried the wrong thing then. Judging from what she said,
      that might have been a good thing. “Thanks, miss. You’ve been a big help,
      really.” I thank her and move to get up. Time for me to get back on the
      move again. “Don’t get in over your head now, yeah? The connect for the
      Bloodchip is a really magnetic guy, or so I hear. At least the junkies
      seem to think so. I told you before that business has sucked lately,
      right? It’s ‘cause I’m the only one left in this neighborhood that’s still
      not slinging the Bloodchip. It’s not my thing, you know? But to the new
      converts to the cause, the entire thing almost looks like some New Age
      cult by now,” she says with ill humour. She elects to stay inside the
      kotatsu, and in this cold, even without the electric heater, I can’t blame
      her. I navigate around the scattered trash and magazines in her room, and
      grasp the knob on the front door. I ask my last, almost forgotten
      question, without bothering to turn around. “Oh yeah. Do you happen to
      know the name of the connect for the Bloodchip?” “Oh, you don’t know?” She
      says the name. The answer was completely not what I was hoping for. For a
      moment, it makes me dizzy. Could this be what ties everything together? I
      struggle to regain my composure, hoping she didn’t spot my momentary
      surprise. Those sinister eyes I looked into before must know by now,
      though she keeps her silence. I say my thanks again as calmly as I can,
      and head out the door and out of the abandoned apartment, back into the
      gray-black world of the cloud covered city.
