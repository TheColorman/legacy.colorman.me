    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - III</h1>
    <p>
      - July. - - “I don’t like weak people.” That’s what she said to me, very
      calmly. - - “I don’t like weak people.” Just like that, Shiki Ryōgi threw
      me out like trash. - - “I don’t like weak people.” I don’t truly know what
      she meant by that. - - But that night, for the first time in my life, I
      hit someone. - - That night, for the first time in my life, I murdered
      someone. - February 10. It’s definitely a cloudy day, but some of you are
      gonna have some welcome sunshine today. I hear the weather report drone on
      in the car radio. It only takes one look out the car window for it to be
      clear that wherever that welcome sunshine is, it’s surely not shining
      anywhere near here. Not a lick of change from yesterday. With a hand on
      the steering wheel, I look at my wristwatch, seeing that the time is
      barely past noon. If this were any normal day, I’d be at Miss Tōko’s
      office, calling some random person for an art exhibition, or taking care
      of expenses. But this was no normal day. I called her up this morning,
      saying I’d be taking a sick leave for the day, as I did yesterday. And now
      I find myself in my car, trundling slowly down the bay side harbour and
      industrial areas. “Take it easy, Kokutō,” was all the warning Miss Tōko
      said to me. I wonder if she somehow knew what I was doing. In any case,
      the warning isn’t enough to stop me. Especially after last night, when
      another victim of the murderous monster had been uncovered. And of all
      places, too… the crime scene last night was the alleyway where the first
      murder was found over four years ago. Only a fool would think that was a
      mere coincidence. With every day comes a new murder, and every day, the
      connections grow stronger, building towards something that the killer
      wants said to somebody. That means there’s little time left. After my
      little stint at the home of that dealer girl yesterday, I spent the rest
      of the day trying to find out where the Bloodchip package was coming from.
      As it turns out, the trail to the drug connect led here, to the harbor
      district, where the connect apparently lives. It’s where I’m headed to
      now, address in hand, to finally confront this man who might hold at least
      some of the answers. The deeper into the harbour district I get, the more
      the traffic starts to become dominated by 18-wheeler semis carrying
      various shipping containers and sea cans in different colors, all going
      out to destinations somewhere in the city, until finally, they are
      virtually the only traffic on the road, a trend broken only twice by a
      port authority car rolling up. Finally, I reach the main road that opens
      into the harbor itself, and from here, I can see the bay quite clearly.
      Ashen waters reflect an equally ashen gray sky as waves crash determinedly
      at the high waterfront. Only a few ships are in today: clearly not a busy
      day for the port, which typically handles 90,000 container tonnage a year,
      but today many of the gantry cranes stand inactive. Little islands dot the
      interior of the bay, some of them no larger than two football fields. A
      dull arc in the distance crosses the great expanse of the bay, the only
      bridge across it. Another bridge called the Broad Bridge was slated to be
      built, and was close to completion at summer last year. But it
      was…destroyed by a typhoon, and when inquiries were made into construction
      safety, all work was halted. There haven’t been any rumblings about it
      being rebuilt, so now its gutted and twisted ruin stands there as a
      monument to failed industry. As it happens, the address I’m looking for is
      quite near the Broad Bridge, and offers a clear view of the level of
      destruction it sustained. This part of the harbor is a quiet one, away
      from the usual bustle of the stevedores and the typical traffic. I choose
      a parking space on the roadside and get out, immediately noting the smell
      of saltwater in the air as I do so. The neighborhood is unremarkable,
      filled with small businesses catering to low-cost housing in the area. The
      proximity of the place to the noisy harbor marks it as a low land value
      area, yet today none of that noise can be heard. If not for the crashing
      of the waves and the returning undertow, the place would have been
      soundless. The address itself is little more than a wooden prefab
      two-floor apartment-for-rent that looks so run-down it feels like it was
      run through just as bad as the nearby Broad Bridge. And yet, according to
      the rumors, the connect to all of the Bloodchip packages in the city
      apparently owns it. Running it through city records seems to turn up a
      name of “Alaya” for the owner, but I highly doubt that’s even true. The
      building only has six studio-size rooms on its first floor, and I knock
      and try every lock on the doors, making sure no one else is in the
      building. With a little nervousness creeping up on me, I try as quietly as
      I can to climb the wooden stairs leading to the second floor, though the
      rickety thirty year old stairs clearly show their age. I find the room I’m
      looking for, only to discover the door is locked. No real problem. I
      produce a screwdriver from my jacket pocket and set to work trying to pry
      the doorknob out by force. This is definitely something crazy I’m doing,
      especially for me. But it isn’t really the time to be bothered by decency.
      With the dealer out, this is my only shot at this. At last, after a few
      minutes of frantic pulling, the doorknob bends and comes lose. “Bingo,” I
      whisper with satisfaction, and pass through the door to steal into the
      room. Immediately after the entrance, I find myself in the kitchen. I
      expected to find some cooking utensils here, but none are present as far
      as I can see. For the most part, it even seems unused. The layout of the
      studio apartment itself is quite narrow, and would probably never
      accommodate any more than two or three people, and that would be pushing
      it. Another doorway leading out of the kitchen goes into another small
      room, though a bit more spacious than this one. From what I can see from
      the kitchen, I find it not so dissimilar to the room of the slinger I
      visited yesterday, though things seem far more cluttered and littered
      about, if that could be believed. Whatever force passed through the room,
      a typhoon or whatever, it seems content to leave everything where they
      were discarded carelessly. In the far wall of the next room, a curtainless
      window is placed, offering a clear panorama of the leaden sea. The
      distinct sound of crashing waves that I heard from outside is eerily
      muffled now, small and far away from hearing. The window seems like the
      only concession to decoration within it that I can see. Without anywhere
      else to go but inside the cluttered room, I make my way in. As soon as I
      step into the room, and take a cursory glance around, I feel the blood
      rushing to the back of my head in shock, and a sensation of collapsing.
      Resisting my body’s inclination to just fall down, I collect myself and
      pass a lingering survey of the room. I came here to find something. I
      expected there to be drugs, some kind of process on how they’re designed
      maybe, if I was lucky. Just some clue that would lead me to the next step.
      I never expected this. “Shiki,” I breathe out, though no one is here to
      listen. What I had seen from the kitchen as trash scattered all over the
      walls and floor are, in fact, photographs. I take one in my hands. This
      one is a photo of Shiki in her high school days. In some corners of the
      room are canvasses, filled with amateur portraits and sketches of Shiki.
      Hanging by wires in the ceiling are more photos, and there are a bunch of
      albums in a small shelf. Too many pictures, too many to count. All of the
      same person. Shiki Ryōgi. The pictures are all of various times, but none
      seem to go back farther than four years ago, to 1995. But many of them are
      extremely, frighteningly recent. There is a photo of Shiki in the uniform
      of Reien Girl’s Academy, when she had to infiltrate the school for a case
      this January. No daily necessities, no food, or entertainment, or personal
      touches decorate this small room beside the sea. And yet, nothing could be
      more personal as this room. This is him, the man and his world entire,
      sprung forth from emptiness to fill void. A cold sweat races down my back.
      This room’s owner could be back at any moment. Should I leave? Or stay and
      talk to the man? Could there still be any reasoning with him? I shake my
      head, dispelling the thought. Any man can be reasoned, I tell myself. And
      this man and I have much talk and explaining to do. We haven’t seen each
      other since school. It is then, when taking stock of myself, when I spot
      the single book lying atop the desk beside the window. It is notable,
      because it sits on that desk as a solitary object, when all other things
      in the room are scattered haphazardly and without clear regard to order.
      This book holds an importance. The green spine, the binding, and the cover
      are immaculately clean, as if it were meant to be presentable to people
      other than its owner, as if it begged to be read. It rests there, shone on
      by the single beam of light pouring into the room from the window, the
      soul of this personal world. I take it in my hand. And, perhaps playing
      into the desires of its owner, I open it to the first page. *** I don’t
      know how many hours have passed. But I have spent them standing in this
      room, reading this book, a diary of the room’s occupant, until the very
      last page. It is a chronicle of murder, a history of violence and its
      genesis. It goes back a long way, well into four years ago, with the
      ritual murders. Where it all began. I let out a long breath, as if I had
      just run for miles, and look up at the ceiling. The diary began at spring,
      four years ago. The very first line, from the very first page, was where
      it could all be traced back to. It clings to my mind, and will for a long
      time, as the point when a person’s mind comes to change. His story is no
      different from any story, beginning simply with two lines: “April 1995. I
      met her,” says a voice coming from the entrance to the apartment, sudden
      and clear. Slow and uneven footsteps make their way across the hardwood
      floor, and when he reaches the entrance to the room, I finally see him,
      with the same intimate smile on his face. “Hey. Long time no see,” he
      says. “It’s been, what, three years, Kokutō?” There is not even the
      slightest hint of astonishment in his voice. The man wears a black woman’s
      skirt, and a red leather jacket. From the messily cut hair that barely
      reaches her shoulders, to his ambiguous features, he has clearly strived
      to look as much like Shiki as he can. His hair is, however, a vivid blonde
      to Shiki’s rich black, and his eyes bear contacts that color them a deep
      red. “This is a bit earlier than I expected you to find me. Thought it’d
      be a bit later, actually.” He avoids looking at me, and instead looks at
      the floor as he speaks. “I thought so too,” I agreed, holding down the
      lump in my throat. “Right? Maybe I screwed up somewhere? I thought I’d
      removed all trace of myself after we last talked back in that old
      restaurant.” “No mistake on your part, I think. But there was one clue.
      Remember the apartment complex in Kayamihama that got torn down back in
      November? I had the opportunity to follow the paper trail for that
      building before that happened. Your name was on the list of tenants. After
      the business with that apartment complex, it worried me, since that was no
      normal building. Somehow, I felt then that you had to have some kind of
      connection to Shiki. Am I right, Leo Shirazumi?” Shirazumi runs a hand
      through his blonde hair, combing it upward, before nodding. “The list of
      tenants, huh? You always were good at searching for people, Kokutō. It was
      another one of Alaya’s little tricks of the Art. It didn’t hold my
      interest for very long. And yet, thanks to it, I met the one person I
      never wanted to meet again here, earlier than I’d planned.” He smiles
      awkwardly, and steps further into the room. When he steps into the light,
      it’s only then that I notice his left hand cut clean from just above the
      elbow, with nothing left below except a dull, dried stump. “But it sounds
      like there’s nothing to hide from you. Yeah, it was three years ago,
      wasn’t it? When you first saw Shiki with a body. It was no coincidence
      that you found me on your way to the Ryōgi estate. I delayed you, because
      I wanted you to see exactly when she murdered someone. Alaya had already
      considered me a failure then, just a thing to be cast off. But I still
      think I made the right choice. It seemed like a disservice to a friend not
      to show you Shiki’s true nature. What she’s really like.” He sits atop the
      desk beside the window, speaking in a tender tone of nostalgia. As he is
      right now, he seems little different from the Shirazumi I knew back then
      in high school. So what is this then? I’ve read his diary, known he was
      the connect to the Bloodchip, and thought he had changed so utterly and
      completely. But now, he seems…normal. Composed, even. Just like the
      Shirazumi of three years ago, still smiling and good. But written in the
      diary in my hands is his claim of responsibility to the murders. All it
      took for him was one bad day, an one individual called Alaya—already gone
      by now—to change him into what he is. So his sins must, like any other
      person’s, be answered for. “The ritual murders from four years ago have
      started again. And now I find out that you’re the one doing them,” I find
      the words come hard to my mouth, though I keep my gaze at him straight.
      Shirazumi himself cannot bring himself to do the same, it seems. “Yes,” he
      nods. “But I wasn’t the serial killer back then. Lay the blame on Shiki
      Ryōgi. I only wanted to protect you from her.” “You’re not a good liar,
      Shirazumi.” I say it more confidently now. From my coat pocket, I retrieve
      a single blotter of the Bloodchip, letting it fall to the ground. They
      flutter in the air before falling, joining the many pictures already
      scattered on the floor. A pained glance is all Leo Shirazumi can spare for
      them. “When you quit school to do something you wanted to do, was all of
      this what you meant?” Shirazumi shakes his head. “Maybe I’ve strayed. Too
      much, you could say. Maybe I was a fool to think that I could even survive
      in this trade. I’ve made a drug that frees people from this prison. But as
      to how it all could have come to this, I honestly don’t know.” His smile
      is tinged with melancholy, and he shivers as he speaks. He grasps his cut
      arm with his good one, letting it wrap around his body, as if to gather
      what warmth he can. As if sensing where I was looking, he talks of his
      arm. “This? Shiki Ryōgi again, if you haven’t already guessed. I expected
      it to start healing in short order, but so far that hasn’t happened. I
      suppose it’s the nature of her spell of death. A wound will heal, but this
      arm is now truly ‘dead.’ Alaya did say to me that life in its true and
      pure form was the domain of sorcery beyond him.” Sorcery. I never expected
      to hear the word from him. But I suppose I should have, having read the
      diary. He was rescued by Sōren Alaya, much like I was myself. All of this
      smelled of the stink of a far reaching, calculated plot. Could it be so,
      even though the man himself was already dead? “Shirazumi, why all these
      murders? What’s the point?” At hearing my question, Leo Shirazumi closes
      his eyes in recollection. “I don’t kill on a whim, you know,” he whispers
      with a pained tone. He puts an open hand in his chest, clutching it as
      firmly as though he were in pain. “I haven’t killed because I wanted it.”
      “Then why?” “Kokutō, do you know a thing about what they call the
      ‘origin?’ Your master is a mage herself, isn’t she? Tōko Aozaki? You must
      have heard of it at some point. It’s a soul’s true nature, the grand
      beginning. What one should be. The origin of my soul was awakened by Sōren
      Alaya, that demon that masqueraded as a plain human. I don’t think Miss
      Tōko ever told me about this origin, or the awakening of the soul. It’s
      all gibberish to me. “I don’t really get it, but you’re saying that’s
      what’s making you kill?” “Don’t think I know a lot about the origin of the
      soul. I only know what Alaya told me; that because I was awakened, there
      was no going back. That it was like instinct in you, that we all had in
      some form. Sometimes, you get special ones, like mine. And unfortunately,
      Alaya happened to find a use in it.” He breathes a deep sigh. Beads of
      sweat begin to collect in his forehead despite the cold. Something is
      changing here. There is a dangerous tinge to Shirazumi now. I spy a quick
      glance toward the door, noting how far I am, and how near he is to it.
      “Are you alright, Shirazumi? There’s something wrong—” “Don’t worry about
      it, alright? This always happens.” He exhales another long thread of air
      before continuing. “Listen, Kokutō. This instinct that I have…it destroys
      sense. It’s stronger than my will. It’s my enemy. Twenty years…of being
      me…isn’t enough to hold it back. It’s just like Alaya said. Anyone with
      his origin awakened is tied to it. I know…you don’t understand, Kokutō.
      But my soul’s origin is ‘consumption.’” His halting voice stops to admit a
      violent cough, and his breathing has become rough and throaty without my
      noticing it, as if he were holding back vomit. The hand that presses
      tightly upon his chest clutches it desperately. He shivers now, more
      violently than even a minute before, and his teeth begin to chatter in
      anticipation. “Shirazumi, what’s happe—” “Let me talk. This could be the
      last sensible conversation I can hold. Now…the origin. It changes the body
      in…subtle ways. Inside. The power of the Art is inside you, making you
      capable of things that the body can’t usually do. It’s more than ancestral
      memory. It’s returning to…some primal state. And it’s so subtle, the
      affected person…doesn’t usually notice the change.” He brings his hand to
      his face, covering it and turning away from me, trying to stifle laughter.
      His shoulders shake, whether from laughter, or from his sickness, I can’t
      truly be sure. “So that’s what this is. Before I knew it, I became…what I
      am now. The origin is an overriding impulse. When it’s awakened…I…stop
      being…I. Because of my origin…I have to consume.” He pauses, his voice
      still trying to halt some inner change. “Fuck! Don’t you understand,
      Mikiya?! Why the fuck does it have to be me, huh?! Why the fuck does my
      origin need to be this way? I’m going to die because of something I barely
      even understand. It can’t end like this! I want to die, still being me.”
      Like in the throes of some great illness, his teeth chatter incessantly.
      He gets up from the desk. I manage to glimpse his face, and his eyes,
      tears welled up in them. His shoulder’s don’t stop shaking as he
      desperately fights himself. “Shirazumi, listen. I have a friend. Tōko
      Aozaki. Let’s take you to her. Maybe she can do something to help you.”
      Shirazumi’s knees fall to the tatami covered floor, his face looking
      downward. “No. I’m special. Different.” He raises his head and looks at
      me. His convulsions are getting worse by the second. But his face holds a
      kind of surrendering tranquility that I didn’t expect to see. “You were
      always good. That’s right. You were always on my side. Maybe it’s because
      of you that I can hold myself back right now. I don’t…I don’t want to have
      to kill you.” He crawls the distance toward me, clinging to my legs with
      his one arm. The strength in that arm is unbelievably strong, and my legs
      almost give way from the pressure. But strangely enough, I don’t feel so
      afraid. The greater the strength in his hands, the better I know how
      desperate he is, how much he wants to get away. And I can’t find it in
      myself to refuse that. “Shirazumi,” I can do nothing except stand here,
      and utter his name, in hopes that he can remember. His hand climbs to my
      coat as he continues to kneel, and now I can feel his shivering, so
      violent that it feels like he’s getting torn apart at the seams. And
      suddenly, he whispers in a low, far voice. “I’m a murderer,” he says, in
      narrow penitence. “Yeah,” I reply, gazing out at sea through the window.
      “I’m not like you,” he says, in retched contrition. “Don’t say that,” I
      reply, gazing out at sea through the window. “I can’t be saved,” he says,
      in choked confession. “You’re still alive, which means that’s another
      lie,” I reply. There is little I can do but to gaze out at sea through the
      window. Words uttered on the verge of tears, and vague answers. What
      salvation is there in that? But at last, Shirazumi manages to force out
      the words that perhaps he hated to say himself. In a thin, threaded voice,
      he pleads. “Then save me, Kokutō.” I can muster no reply. I curse my own
      powerlessness, how I can do so little to help him. There is a beat of
      silence between us. Then he groans, a low rumble, long held, like a
      monstrous noise that comes from deep inside him. The hand he clasps my
      coat with gathers strength in it for one surprising moment, and he uses it
      to pull himself up. In one swift motion, he strikes my chest, and then a
      moment of disorientation, and a sharp pain in my back. When I pick myself
      back up, I find that he had flung me toward the wall. I look back at him.
      He looks back at me with maddened, bloodshot eyes. “Don’t follow. Don’t
      look for me. Next time, I will kill you,” he says, his voice calmer than
      it had been since he came into the room. He climbs on the desk in one
      swift motion, then smashes the glass window with one strike of his hand.
      “Shirazumi! We can still go to Tōko Aozaki. I’m sure she can—” “Sure she
      can what, Kokutō?” he spits out, malice clear in his tone. “Make me
      better? You can’t even guarantee that. And if I get better, what’s waiting
      for me? Nothing but a death sentence. And Shiki Ryōgi herself hunts me. I
      walk a path, and I know how it ends either way. But I still have to run.”
      He snickers for a brief moment before quickly jumping out the window. The
      last thing I see of him is his blonde hair, floating in the seaborne
      breeze. I hurry toward the window, casting my eyes downwards. But no trace
      can be found of him in the harbor. “Idiot,” I whisper, not knowing whether
      I directed it at Shirazumi or myself. This isn’t over then. Not by a long
      shot. He thinks there’s no way out, and I can’t really promise him there
      is. I bite my lip as I leave the room, this temple to Shiki, thinking
      about how helplessly caught up I am in this whole thing. No easy solution
      seems to be forthcoming, but there are things left to do still. I need to
      find Shiki, and I can’t let Shirazumi go, even if saving him seems
      impossible. I can’t allow him to murder more people. For his sake.
