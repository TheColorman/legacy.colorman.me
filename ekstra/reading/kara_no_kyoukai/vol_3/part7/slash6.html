    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - /6</h1>
    <p>
      The body slides from the wall, and settles into the floor in a slow,
      restive, pace. There, fallen on his face, unmoving, lies Mikiya Kokutō.
      The face seeps through with slick and rich blood, flowing down from the
      left side of his face and wetting the dirty concrete floor. My hand holds
      a knife, soaked with blood, though it is not my knife. I stare at it
      dumbly, frozen in place, afraid to approach Mikiya’s corpse, or disturb it
      even slightly. He’s dead. “I’m sorry. I…this wasn’t in the plan.” My small
      whispers echo in the room, but only the sound of rain rises in answer.
      Tears form in my eyes. The only ally that the old Leo Shirazumi has ever
      had is now gone. Old memories come to fore. Memories of Leo Shirazumi
      stopping school, of jokes, and doubts, and threats, and lectures, all from
      disapproving faces and voices. But it was only Mikiya Kokutō who wished me
      luck. There can be no forgetting that memory. Leo Shirazumi’s happiness
      then still lights a dim and fading beacon inside. But now that beacon that
      called back old emotions is fading, and it was I who killed it. I know how
      easily men can die. The old Leo Shirazumi once tried to avoid the truth of
      it, but to his despair, he came face-to-face with it the first time he
      killed a man. But now, it is surely not my fault. “Why did you side
      against me, Kokutō? When you were my one friend. You knew what I was. I
      thought you were the only one that wouldn’t be my enemy.” Even if the
      world did not accept me, then at the very least, he could accept me. If
      only he were alive! He was right. There is no love left for Shiki Ryōgi.
      The only one that needs her is me, the murderous monster. If she would be
      the same as me, what then? A special existence is significant only because
      of its singularity. The monster had already decided to kill her, even if
      she had regained her former purpose. Seeing what exactly I’ve lost lie
      before me, I realize. I, the murderer, needed the comfort of a companion;
      and I, Leo Shirazumi, needed Mikiya. Perhaps the only reason the old Leo
      persisted in living is because of him. When he stood in front of me, the
      cracks seemed to ease, a pressure released. Now, he lies still before me,
      and I feel nothing. And so, the part of me that still holds the old Leo
      Shirazumi quiets and fades. I’m sorry, Kokutō. It looks like the part of
      me you believed in has now finally disappeared. “As for the rest of it…” I
      utter with a lick of my lips. All is well. I am alive. And so is Shiki
      Ryōgi. And once she returns to the way she was before, it will all be
      alright. Ah, yes. I don’t need Mikiya anymore. Isn’t this what I’d always
      wanted anyway? I’ll beat the impulse inside of me, knowing someone like me
      exists out there. I will see her soon. I leave the room, climbing back up
      to the main warehouse, my garden of sin, where Shiki, the girl I’d loved
      for so long, awaits. The blood roils and beckons inside of me, and I let
      slip a delighted smile. In my mind, I see her form from minutes ago,
      drenched in sweat and spit, and I gulp in anticipation. I want to do it to
      her now. With Kokutō dead, there’s nothing left for her to sustain her
      stupid masquerading. The real murderer will come in her most enchanting
      form. The drugs must still be affecting her. Even if she would lash out in
      rage, she’d still be unable to stand. No one can craft a better stage than
      this, surely. My tongue quivers, relishing the thought. I want to eat her
      inside and out; starting from the tips of her toes, then on to her body,
      drinking in her delicious sweat, delighting in the smell of her, the taste
      of her insides. “Sweat?” I stop in the middle of the foliage. Yes, she was
      sweating when I shot the drug in her. But how could she, and why in such
      great amounts? All I shot her up with was a muscle relaxant. She shouldn’t
      be sweating so much. It’s almost like her body used the sweat to expel the
      toxin— “No. It can’t be.” I break into a sprint as soon as the thought
      enters my mind, hurrying back to the place I left Shiki alone. I push my
      way recklessly through the thick brush. I get there in a few seconds,
      hoping to see the scene that I wished for. But no words spring forth now.
      In the little concrete path in the warehouse, the one place where the
      marijuana plants had not taken root, she is there, standing. With the
      narrowed, hellbent eyes contrasting with her overwhelming aura of
      composure, Shiki Ryōgi stands before me.
