    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - VI</h1>
    <p>
      At last, two hours after I left Miss Tōko’s office, I finally reach the
      warehouse in the docks, not so far from Shirazumi’s room that I had paid a
      visit to before. It only makes sense that this is where he’s growing the
      weed. It can’t be too far from his home, so it was only a matter of
      narrowing it down to a place big enough to hide them, but where no one
      usually treaded. The long abandoned warehouse once served as storage for
      the pier, but the company that owned it closed long ago, which made it the
      perfect candidate to hide, store, and grow the weed around this area. I
      approach the structure, not truly minding the late winter rain as it pours
      above me with the same gusto as it did in the past few nights. The
      warehouse is an especially large one, a large enough space cleared in its
      perimeter as if to give it breathing room. The large steel door that
      serves as its front entrance stands at a height many times my own, and now
      it seems to be locked tight. Unfortunately, the screwdriver trick I used
      before would be a laughable effort if I even attempted it here. So I
      resolve to travel the warehouse’s perimeter to see if I can find any
      alternate ingress. I make my way to the structure’s right flank, but I can
      find no breach or opening. Windows line the wall, but placed at the height
      of around five or six meters high; I’m not getting in there without a
      ladder. The other side, maybe. After all, with the warehouse standing
      directly at dockside, surely its sea-facing side would have some kind of
      entrance leading directly from its port to the basement so that arriving
      ships can load and unload faster. After a circuit around the perimeter
      that felt like it went on forever, I finally reach dockside, and sure
      enough, there it is. A stair leading directly to the lower seawall
      adjacent to the warehouse, and with it, a single door leading inside. I
      try to silence myself as much as possible as I turn the knob ever so
      slightly. It seems to be unlocked. I open the door slowly, wide enough
      only to admit me, then I steal inside. The room within seems to be some
      kind of temporary storage room before pallets are stored topside. It’s
      large, but a bit narrower than I expected. It doesn’t take long for me to
      spot the stairs going up, and the door to the main body of the warehouse.
      I try to get closer, until I hear a sharp metallic clang behind me. I hear
      a grunt of pain, realizing only too late that it is my own. I never get
      time to feel the pain, or press down a hand behind my head; only time to
      collapse as darkness overtakes everything. I wake up to the sensation of a
      gulp, my mouth grasping for air as I swallow something I don’t agree with.
      Then, pain. A dull pain in my elbow, and then a sharp, sudden one on both
      my legs. Then, whatever caused the pain withdraws from the back of my
      knees, and the sensation is reduced to a pulsating agony. I look around,
      too confused to cry out. My sight is still recovering, and my head is
      still aching, but I can see that I am still in the same place as before,
      probably only a few minutes having passed. It’s only now that I notice how
      cold it is, and how much my body is shivering. I try to stand, but then
      the pain returns in my left arm. I look at it, and strangely with little
      surprise, I find my elbow twisted the wrong way. I try to look at my legs,
      seeing that both of them have been stabbed in the back of the knee by some
      blade. Blood is seeping out. I can feel it. I cannot run. I lie back down.
      I need to collect myself. Strangely enough, after I swallowed the thing
      that felt like it was shoved in my throat, the pain seems to retreat until
      it can barely be felt. A drug, for sure, morphine maybe. But there’s
      nothing that fast acting, is there? Unless it was some kind of medicine
      enhanced by the Art. I take stock of the situation and turn my head around
      the room, and on the opposite wall from me, I find the shadow of someone
      lingering. He looks at me, bending with one knee on the rubble and
      dirt-filled floor of the warehouse, observing me with a curiosity. “Sorry,
      pal. I don’t really tie men up. I prefer them like this instead,” he says,
      standing up and making his way to my side of the room. What I see is
      dulled from darkness and the pain, and the sensation of being warm and
      cold at the same time might disorient me, but I can distinguish clearly
      enough who the approaching figure is. “Shirazumi.” “You just don’t listen,
      do you? I told you not to find me. It’s why you keep ending up in these
      situations. But still, I’m happy, truly. You came looking for me, after
      all. I know that you’re on my side, yes.” He draws the word out in a long
      breath. “Letting Ryōgi have you would be such a waste, I realize that now.
      If only you’d been a real friend to me.” The voice that utters the words
      is not his own. They are proud, boastful words, but not the words of Leo
      Shirazumi. It seems all an act, and I can’t hear it as anything else. “You
      can’t just make people like you.” The moment a word comes out of my mouth,
      the low pain from my head returns, and every word only worsens it, making
      it boil from inside. Still, I persist. “Your drugs didn’t work like you
      wanted to.” The room seems to darken as Shirazumi frowns, clicking his
      tongue as he looks at me. “You’re talking too much again, Kokutō. But
      you’re right. I gave the fools and the phonies the drugs that they needed
      to play out their miserable lives. They took to it like flies to a corpse.
      And I, who sold them their happiness, was their new unseen champion. But
      that was never anything other than a secondary concern.” He shrugs, his
      every word an evasion. If he can’t say it himself, then it’ll have to be
      me. “What you sold wasn’t just drugs. It was more than that, wasn’t it?”
      He sighs, and stares daggers directly toward me. “Yes. I wanted someone
      just like me. But only Ryōgi can be like that. So I thought that maybe I
      should just make them, right? The weed in this warehouse was courtesy of
      Alaya. It’s a bit different than what’s out there, eh? You can thank his
      Art for that. It dissolves slowly inside your body, the effect lasting for
      a long-ass time. Your body can’t hope to resist it. You get high from it,
      it’ll eat away at your mind after only a few dozen uses.” “And to those
      who pass, you make them take the Bloodchip?” “That’s something a little
      extra for those who have the potential. They’re a unique kind, dipped
      straight into my blood. Alaya said that the awakened are bound to their
      origin. I thought that my blood, with Alaya’s magic coursing through it,
      would be different. I got a result I was more than happy with. For many,
      the Bloodchip is just like any drug. Some die because they couldn’t handle
      it. But if anyone could truly handle it, they would have been just like
      me. But then, the corpses of those who died had to be taken care of. So I
      ate the bodies of people that I was disgusted to even think about eating.”
      “And you said you didn’t kill because you wanted to? Is that how you
      justify it?” My throat is burning, but still I berate him. Shirazumi’s
      face is clouded over with a disappointment. “It’s not my fault they died
      because of it. They wanted it, they had it. It’s out of my hands if they
      couldn’t take it. Pitiful things. If only they were like me, they could
      have lived and tasted the glory of being free.” My dizziness worsens, and
      the walls and floor seem to shift and move subtly, throbbing with the pain
      in my head. Could the drug I swallowed earlier be doing this? “I’ve never
      had someone take the Bloodchip and survive in the three years I’ve been
      doing it,” Shirazumi explains. “I was about to give up. But then, Ryōgi
      woke up. I rejoiced just as much as you did, you’d best believe. We’re
      connected that way, aren’t we, pal?” He smiles, and I can do nothing but
      to keep my eyes on him. “Because it was I, Leo Shirazumi, and you, Mikiya
      Kokutō, that destroyed Shiki Ryōgi those three years ago. You ruined what
      she had inside of her, while I did the same to her outside world.” I close
      my eyes. Is he right? Would Shiki have been better off four years ago if
      she hadn’t met me? Did we, together, ruin Shiki more than she could have
      done to herself? “It was all so simple, Kokutō. Shiki’s habit of walking
      alone at night proved to be quite convenient for me. I tailed her,
      learning her favorite paths and patterns through the city. Then, I
      planned. I would kill someone that happened to wander along the path she
      would take, always just a little ways ahead of her, making sure it was
      fresh. The first ones still saw me before I took the life from them, but
      the next few ones were skilled work. They never saw me. Like the one you
      saw after we said goodbye to each other on that day you went to the Ryōgi
      estate. It took some work, but the timing was just right for you to
      encounter it just the same time Shiki was heading back.” My head seems to
      be splitting apart at the seams, and it overcomes me so much I can barely
      hear what Shirazumi is saying. My heart beats desperately, the blood like
      a fire through my body, and I did not know that it could be so difficult
      to force yourself to breathe. “Last Monday, those four victims…it was
      you,” I struggle to say. He nods with satisfaction. “Yeah, they weren’t
      any good at all. I convinced them to attack her, but all Ryōgi did was
      immobilize them, leaving them there to brood on their misfortune. Ryōgi
      never crossed the boundary. I had to clean her mess up after her, and kill
      them to make sure they didn’t talk. But if it made Ryōgi doubt herself for
      just one moment, then maybe it was worth it.” He walks back to the other
      side of the room, where he seems to have left some things. “It’s almost
      time. I’m sorry to have had to hurt you Mikiya. It’s all right. It’ll all
      be better in a while.” Lying atop the floor is a knife, and a small,
      cylindrical object, both of which he takes in his one remaining hand.
      Something is suspicious about the knife. Something familiar about its
      slender figure, and the craftsmanship…like Shiki’s— “No. What have you
      done to her?” “Nothing that would permanently hurt her. It’s you who I
      need now though.” There is a notable shift in his voice, a softer,
      familiar tone of the person I once knew, though his words remain the same.
      “Forget about Shiki for a second. All she is doing is resting in the floor
      above, and tomorrow, I will even send her home.” He comes near me again,
      holding both objects in his hand. “Let’s start this. No need to worry.
      I’ve suffered failures up until now because I’ve only given them the
      medicine. But now I remember what Alaya said. That spell requires the
      consent of both involved to awaken the origin. This time, I’ll be right.
      If you only wish it, all will be yours. You won’t be a failure, will you,
      Mikiya? You can be special.” There it is again, that touch of anxiety in
      his voice. I shake my head, refusing. “Becoming special, but you lose
      yourself…” I cough, finding it difficult to breathe and speak at the same
      time. “Didn’t you say that you hated that, Shirazumi?” “Words spoken in
      the heat of the moment. Words can be changed. Look at what happened to me
      when I was awakened! I can do things now that no normal human can do. I’m
      not a loser anymore, and no one can say I am weak. I do what I want, and
      live how I want to live. This is the kind of happiness the Leo Shirazumi
      from four years ago could never have hoped to achieve.” Wishes of becoming
      special, of outstripping one’s peers. It’s the common dream of anyone.
      Shirazumi has his sins, but this is not one of them. “Who you are won’t be
      washed away, Mikiya. I am still here, still Leo Shirazumi. I mastered this
      impulse, and so can you. Don’t fear it. I’ve consumed things, consumed
      people, not under the influence of my origin, but my own will.” This is
      the true face of the man you knew, and more fool you if you think I lie.
      His last words to you were the death throes of a damned man trying to eke
      out that last bit of sympathy from you. Miss Tōko always made sure to warn
      me. “Aren’t you amazed at me? I want to see that face of yours lighting
      up, a surprised smile maybe. Why aren’t you surprised, Mikiya?!” “Because
      I know.” “What?” His face shifts into a blank amazement. I did not lie.
      After all, I read his diary. I know that his slide into madness was his
      forfeiting of humanity. When the man I knew as Leo Shirazumi ceased to
      truly exist. He wanted me to save him, the last proof of his former
      dignity, or an echo of the past. And I want to do that, but how? “You
      committed many murders,” I begin, “And so that you could run from your
      sins, you cast off yourself. You justified it with your love for Shiki
      Ryōgi, sought her out so that your killing would have meaning. But what
      sick love do you return to her?” “Quiet!” He says with a raised voice. He
      goes near me, still lying and unwilling to move, and kicks me square in
      the back. The pain flares, and recedes just as quickly, melting in with
      the other aches in my body. “We’re not talking about me, are we? We’re
      talking about you.” The annoyance is clear in his voice. He stabs the
      knife into the ground, using it to cut the cylindrical object he holds
      into two. “It’s bad for you to take so much medicine in so little a span
      of time, but in this case, you’re leaving me no choice. You can thank your
      own stubborn attitude for it.” He takes hold of my hair, using it to pull
      me up and prop me against the wall. He puts the drug inside his mouth and
      chews it. Then, holding me down, he leans in to take my mouth in his. His
      tongue slides inside, bringing the drug along with it. I cannot resist.
      The drug goes down my throat. At last, he parts, and looks upon me with a
      face of calm expectation. “That’ll solve everything. That’s a dosage ten
      times larger than normal. Your body can’t handle it for sure. But before
      it gets serious, you’ll take this and shove it down your throat,” he says
      as he produces a red blotter from his coat, letting it fall to the floor
      beside me. “And you’ll do it yourself, because you want to, you need to.
      And you’ll throw yourself away just like me, Mikiya.” My vision begins to
      get clouded, and everything seems to shift in and out of focus. “What are
      you waiting for? You want to be special, right? You want to be freed from
      the prison of your life, right? Then why won’t you listen? Eat it, Mikiya!
      I need you!” I see the Bloodchip blotter on the floor, still within reach.
      I ignore it, but Shirazumi picks it up and puts it into my one good hand.
      When I don’t move, he begins to become visibly irritated. “Just take it,
      Mikiya! The drugs will tear your body apart if you don’t. You’ll just fall
      over dead if you don’t eat it. Choose! Die as a human or live as something
      more. This one isn’t even a choice. Anyone will answer the obvious!” He’s
      right. It isn’t even a choice for most. And yet, I shake my head at him.
      “Why?” he asks, his voice sounding like it was wrung out of his throat.
      And though it would have perhaps been a better choice if I didn’t answer,
      I still speak. “Maybe it’s just not that interesting.” Shirazumi’s face
      looks as though it has frozen over, and the cracks in his hastily thought
      up plan begin to finally sound out across the silence. The fire in my
      blood feels like it could shoot out of any vein now, getting hotter until,
      I suspect, it finally boils. “When I look at you, Shirazumi, I see a
      broken thing. If becoming special means becoming like you, then maybe
      being special isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Being special isn’t for
      me.” There is no amity left in Shirazumi’s eyes, none remaining of the
      little warmth he still had. My words have cemented me as his enemy. “What
      are you saying? You have no other choice! I know you’re just like everyone
      else, always wanting to be better. I know you are!” Indignant and
      disbelieving, he shouts, and laughs like a madman as he looms over me.
      Whether it is a laugh borne of panic or irritation, I can’t say. “How can
      you even say things like that Kokutō? Dammit, you’re serious, aren’t you?
      You’re going to let yourself die, aren’t you? Why the fuck are you acting
      like this is all normal. It’s you who’s broken, yes. Always something off
      about you, I know it.” “You’re the one that’s off, Shirazumi. Take a look
      at yourself and tell me I’m wrong,” I spit out at him, as if my body
      forced me to. It’s not doing any favors for how long I get to live, but if
      it makes him rethink himself, than maybe that’s alright too. “That’s what
      your daily life is like. When you first murdered someone, you couldn’t
      bear to see your crime and what you’d done. You ran away. And you deluded
      yourself into thinking that your murders were justifiable and inevitable,
      abnormal murders for an abnormal mind. A cold comfort and a weak excuse.
      And you gave in to your madness. You thought it would always be a
      convenient out, something you can tell yourself. But the truth is, even
      now, you’re still running.” That was it, I think. Ever since he first
      killed a man, and fell into the plans of the man named Sōren Alaya, Leo
      Shirazumi the man was irredeemably lost. He thought himself a broken
      existence, and became such in time, and then he looked for Shiki, who he
      thought was a monster just like him. It reassured him of his monstrous
      existence if he knew other monsters were there, lurking in the night, just
      as broken as him. Shirazumi simply says, “Shut up,” as he narrows his
      eyes. But if I don’t say what I have to say to him until the last, then
      coming here would have been meaningless. “Shiki was brought up as a tool,
      and she’d never known anything else but the art of murder for a long time.
      But you took murder up as a crutch for your problems. It stinks of a lie.
      It’s wrong for the news to call you a murderous monster. Shiki’s got a far
      heavier weight on her shoulders than you. You don’t know how hard it is
      for her to hold in an impulse she had no choice in. You always had a
      choice, and you’ve made it.” “Shut up, Kokutō. I’m warning you…” “You’re
      stupid for thinking you’re the same as her. You’re a broken mirror, seeing
      what you can’t ever become. You’ve committed murder, but you deny the
      nature of your own sins. You’re just running like a coward. You’re no
      killer or murderous monster. Just a mad dog named Leo Shirazumi.” He
      wanted to be saved. But Miss Tōko was right. She’s always right, in the
      end. He can’t be saved, no matter how much I wanted to. “I said shut the
      fuck up, goddamit!” His shout is replete with his anger, said like a
      potent curse. He retrieves Shiki’s knife from the floor, takes a moment to
      make sure that I cannot, or will not, move, and raises it above his head.
      His breathing stops. Mine stops with it. He leaves the rest to his fury.
      The knife swings down. There is a moment of blinding pain, as my head
      feels ready to split open when the blade bites deep into the brow, going
      downward fast, across my eye. And then the world disappears.
