    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - /7</h1>
    <p>
      There is a different sort of beauty even to Shiki’s disheveled form. And
      it is precisely that which makes Leo Shirazumi forget to even breathe for
      a moment. The handcuffs that once bound her now hangs uselessly from her
      right arm like an overlarge accessory. There is no damage to the handcuffs
      themselves, nor a chink in the chain, or some breakage in its ring. The
      same cannot be said, however, of Shiki’s left hand, from which fresh blood
      emerges red and whole. For it appears that in order to free her hands from
      the cuffs, she has had to gnaw through the base of her left thumb. *** Leo
      Shirazumi gives a vaguely amused laugh. “You truly are the best,” he says,
      though even his chuckling cannot hide the measure of temper in his voice.
      “A perfect monster.” His neck even trembles as he says it. How pathetic.
      He’s in a play and the acting’s not up to snuff. I’m already tired of
      hearing this bastard’s voice, and I’ve got no time to hear him prattle on
      about his world views. “Now, Ryōgi, let’s get this started. You are tied
      to me now,” he says as he approaches me with surefooted steps, like a moth
      to a flame. But I do not even deign to look at him as I speak to him. “Get
      someone else to go with you, because I sure as hell won’t.” It takes a
      while for him to register what I just said as he just stops there in his
      tracks, the most astonished look decorating his face. “What? But…” “I
      neither have the time nor the inclination to run around with a psycho like
      you.” I mean, after all, what could I even do if I were a monster like
      him? And if that’s all he can offer, than he’s really going to have to
      step it up. I’ve known what I wanted long ago. I wanted the hollow in my
      soul to be filled. And perhaps my homicidal impulse may never be
      completely silenced, but I think, just maybe, I can keep it in check.
      Shiki’s reason for murder and ’ reason for murder were different things.
      The events of the past summer taught me that. I used to struggle so much,
      searching for that one, distinct sensation of living. But now, even that
      has become little more than a dim memory, and who knows if I ever found
      it. But I do know that the little hollow in my soul that Tōko once spoke
      of, isn’t really so hollow any more. And because of that, I am not the of
      the past. I go back home, struggle to find what it means to be me, and if
      I can’t discover it, then so be it. But I won’t give in to the convenient
      excuse of being born with a murderous streak as an escape from my
      problems. I have to do that, for the sake of the one that fills the hollow
      in my soul, and for the sake of Shiki, who sacrificed himself for my
      happiness. “You’re kidding, right, Ryōgi?” “Toodles, mister murdererous
      monster.” And with that, I start to walk. My body is still queasy from the
      drugs, my left hand hurts like a motherfucker, but even in that state, I
      pass through and beside Leo Shirazumi like he was just some stranger on
      the street. He doesn’t even have a clue where to begin, though his
      exhalation begins to get louder as he stares at my back. “So even you
      would betray me?” he asks, though his words become little but whispers in
      the din of the rain. Yes, I’m listening to nothing save for the sound of
      the rain. “I can’t let that pass. I’ve done so much for you. Killed so
      many. And now you throw me away like trash? It’s me you should be
      thanking! You should be mine!” I stagger a little, but I right myself soon
      enough, and continue walking. Must be the drugs. So much of it in this
      place. I have to get out, no looking back. Get out of here, and back into
      the familiar rain. But, he speaks again, this time clear over the noise
      despite its smallness. “Oh, I see. Going back to Mikiya, aren’t we,
      Ryōgi?” A vague humor in his tone. “Then why not stay? Since he’s already
      here, after all.” What? Did…did I hear him right? No, it can’t be. He
      couldn’t have followed me, chased after me. “Y—you…” I can’t say it. And
      though I was determined not to look back, I do so now. Why now? When I was
      so close? I promised myself that there would be no murder, that I would
      just need to live. “It’s your fault for being so slow to turn, Ryōgi. I
      tried to find someone a little more…cooperative. Of course, that failed.”
      What is he saying? His voice seems so low and faded, like my hearing was
      dampened from an abrupt noise. “This is your knife, right? Thanks for
      letting me borrow it. Pity I sullied it.” A metallic clicking as he tosses
      the knife at the floor before my feet. The silver sheen of the blade is
      tainted by red stains. Someone’s blood. His blood. No. The smell of it is
      so familiar. The smell of his blood on that night beneath the heavy rain.
      There was no forgetting it. “So…you’re gone now,” I say under my breath as
      I walk forward. I have to get the knife. “I took care of him. So that you
      can finally do what you were supposed to do. Kokutō was sermonizing to me
      until the end, you know. One thing you can count on for him. He spouted
      some crap about us being opposites. Which is funny, isn’t it? We’re so
      alike, you and I!” The rain beats down annoyingly hard on the roof of the
      warehouse. I kneel down to pick up my blade. The blood on it is fresh,
      newly supped from the body. I lost him, so near and so close a time. You
      idiot. I told you to stay with Tōko, didn’t I? Dying so worthlessly like
      this…is just like you. Kill Shirazumi, and there’s no going back, Shiki.
      He said that to hold me back, I know now. Yet the beast he tried to
      protect slaughtered him without a thought. I saw that beast as someone who
      needed to be put down. Maybe I was right after all. Maybe. I grasp the
      knife with my hands, one palm closed around the naked blade. I stand,
      holding it close to my chest. And with my head still turned to the ground,
      I speak. “Fine. Let’s dance.” I can’t turn my eyes to look at him. Like
      before, even giving him the dignity of an equal glance would be giving him
      too much. “You said that you couldn’t forgive me. And on that one and only
      score, we agree, Shirazumi.” And with that, the beast pushes himself to a
      run toward me. I ignore him. He will die. Or I will. But all that can be
      dealt with just a little later. The lingering warmth of the blood on the
      blade calls to me, to feel it before it disappears. Leo Shirazumi leaps,
      an assault without finesse. But I don’t move. And the next moment, the
      beast strikes me, claws digging into my leg, tearing away flesh and
      drinking deeply of my blood before it spatters the floor red in a violent
      slash. He runs past me. But I do not move. I hold the knife as tightly as
      I can, like an irreplaceable treasure. Memento mori. The warmth of the
      blood is immediate yet fading, the air or my body stealing its heat. A
      dying heart, pressed close to my chest. My body, too, feels colder now, so
      much that I feel the stirrings of a shiver. But the pain of the wound on
      my side is little and far away, like faint echoes of wind. For I still
      remember the pain of that rain-soaked night, when I chased him down and
      hurt him. Only our frozen sighs played between us As we watch our breaths
      fade slowly into stillness. The enemy strikes me again, the claw-like
      nails ripping into the flesh of my other leg. He takes his time to kill
      me. He enjoys himself, playing with his prey. He does, after all, have all
      the time in the world. The rain does not abate. It is a little thing,
      insignificant to most people, but to me, it is the most pleasing thing in
      the world. Even the memory of rain: Of an endless gray veil seen after
      school, where I heard you whistling. He runs past yet again, gouging out
      flesh in my flank. There is a tearing noise, and the sound of something
      speckling the concrete. Nails dig as deep as bone, and little rivulets of
      blood drip down freely from my waist and legs, soaking the floor in a
      deep, vivid red. Even standing up is hard to bear. It’s Shiki who I
      remember now. Him, and the happy times he spent with you in those lazy
      sunset afternoons. Even the memory of sunset: Of a classroom ablaze in
      orange light, as you and I talked. The beast’s shows off his power now,
      his dominance. He goes faster than I’ve seen him, and still his attacks
      find their mark as if all the world was slow to it. I’d never be able to
      keep up. I’m lost, and my body follows. But my arm can still move. I have
      to stop the beast when he makes his fourth try. Beside me you would smile,
      and that would be enough To bid my soul rest For a fourth time, it comes.
      He moves to hit my right arm. And though I see it coming, I cannot make
      myself move. How could I kill it? Beside me you would walk, and that would
      be enough To bid the rift between us close I’m losing too much blood, and
      the world starts to look darker, more pronounced. At any moment, I could
      collapse. And still, I keep his words in my mind. I can’t kill Leo
      Shirazumi. It’s the last thing he asked of me. And I only have that
      thought to give value to me now. Once, a moment in time We stopped for
      shade, warm unmoving sunlight peeking through leaves But I am glad. You
      were there for me, ready to pull me back when I strayed, always ready to
      accept me. And those times, though I never said it, were the happiest
      times of my life. And there, as you laughed, you said that one day, we’d
      stand in the same place The beast draws close again, for the fifth, and
      final time. He aims for the neck now. We both know what will happen. A
      vital artery cut, and my lifeblood gushing out as it all ends. They were
      words that I’ve yearned to hear for so long. Death approaches, and if I
      look back now, I would see it smiling, proudly and broadly boasting. Every
      scratch it scores against me is another tearing of that happy lie, that
      illusion of peaceful existence. Of a past that never came to pass, of
      boring student life, of the remains of days with no conflict, and no
      monsters, and no madness. Now only fleeting memories of days never
      fulfilled. I thank you. But I am truly sorry. I finally raise my head,
      seeing with the inner Eye, the Arcane Eyes, and before me, I see my
      enemy’s death, tracing themselves all over his body. I know I’ll lose it
      all of what I am that you’ve put your faith on. But I’ve lost you now,
      even though I loved you. And I know no one will be beside me now, there to
      pull me back to your world. But still…but still…this wild animal killed
      you. And that is one thing I cannot forgive. My enemy is coming, reckless
      and complacent in victory. It will be an easy thing to kill him. I shift
      my feet slightly. The floor is water. And I need to be light as a swan
      upon it. Then the end will be mercifully quick. There it is. Shirazumi’s
      one arm is extended, and upon it dances one of the lines of death. I let
      him come close, close enough to smell him. And when his arm is almost upon
      my neck, I swing the knife that lies just below it upward, sweeping the
      arm and casting it aside effortlessly as it loses strength and dies. No
      time to spare. I shift just to his left, bringing my knife arm around and
      down in a wide swing at the line on his left leg, killing it. He begins to
      stumble as he loses the balance on his dead leg. Then his right leg in one
      swift motion. Then, in the moment that he is still in the air, I plunge
      the blade deep into his chest in one clean and solid stroke, finally
      pushing him to the ground. The knife stands upright like a cairn marker,
      piercing right through to the heart. Shirazumi coughs only once, and it is
      over. The face he donned in death is one of astonishment, as if he was
      more concerned at how quickly he had died than the fact that he had died
      at all. *** Leo Shirazumi lies truly dead in the warehouse floor as Shiki
      still grasps the knife sticking out of his chest with both hands, having
      to lean down on one knee as she does so. Angled light comes through from
      the windows, dull and ashen, bathing the girl and the corpse in pale
      illumination that makes her look like some kind of psychopomp, solemn and
      colorless. No blood spills from Leo Shirazumi’s corpse. The wounds in
      fact, seem very trifling, save for the one in the chest. Yet he is dead,
      blood and all. Such was the power of the Arcane Eyes. There is nothing
      left to spill out. The only blood that lies scattered on the warehouse
      floor comes from Shiki’s own body. Blood from the arm, the leg, and the
      body, from wounds that she still struggles to withstand. It doesn’t worry
      her too much, however. She has worked through worse before. Even so, the
      hands that a moment ago grasped the knife tightly now seem to lose
      whatever animating force they had, and fall away to Shiki’s side as she
      herself collapses with back to the floor. A large sigh escapes her lips.
      Her breaths are large gulps of air, struggling through the pain. She lets
      her body rest now, so that she can call for some kind of help later.
      “There’s no use to it,” she whispers to herself as she looks up at the
      light of the sky. The scene outside the windows, however, is still the
      same rain as before. It’s always in winter, she thinks, under these skies,
      that I dirty my hands with blood. I can’t go home anymore. You would only
      be angry if I showed up at your doorstep, dirtied. “But I know you’d still
      wait for me.” You walked with me. You grasped my bloodied hands and showed
      me the way home. They were times covered in hazy dream, now fleeting and
      soon to vanish. She gulps, and her consciousness sways and flickers as
      unsteadily as the light of a vigil candle, and there is something fair,
      she thinks, in the passing of a life. She steadies her breath, not to
      live, but perhaps, finally, to sleep the sleep of the just. The eyes that
      drink in the sunlight show rare tears. She remembered her old promise to
      herself when she awoke, to only cry when it was of worth for the tears.
      Nothing seemed more appropriate than his death. She closes her eyes, and
      then she grows quiet. Her thoughts have no regrets. But it is only a
      matter of time before I become as mad as Shirazumi; a monster that tasted
      warmth, and can never go back, crossing the boundary to be empty of
      anything.
