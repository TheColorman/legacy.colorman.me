    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - I</h1>
    <p>
      - April 1995. I met her. - It has been a week since the night that me and
      Shiki chanced upon that news report on TV. The label the news gave to the
      killer, a “murderous monster,” ended up sticking, and lately, everybody’s
      been using it, even Daisuke Akimi, my uncle, who at 5am in the morning,
      now sits in my modest apartment, helping himself to a slice of French
      toast that I made for him as he skims the morning paper. The date on the
      broadsheet reads February 8. Unfortunately, in the six intervening days
      since he’s received the moniker, the ‘murderous monster’ has claimed six
      more victims, one for each day. “God, they’re really sticking with this
      name, aren’t they?” remarks Daisuke. “I thought the department made a deal
      not to get the names of the vics out so quick too. Makes the job harder,
      you know?” To hear him talk would make you think he was discussing some
      other person’s case, which is far from the truth. In fact, he has a
      relationship with it as close as kin. He was the primary detective on the
      case three years ago, and the brass have seen fit to saddle it with him
      again, being the most informed officer they have. It only makes sense.
      “Are you sure it’s alright for you to be lazing about here, Daisuke? I
      mean, I’m looking at the front page of that paper, and it’s the story of
      the last night’s fatality right there.” I say as I eat my breakfast at the
      table, facing Daisuke. His face is hidden behind the newspaper, but I know
      that he heard me. “I’ve been running around checking leads for a week now,
      and every day there’s a fresh murder. Let the SDF handle it, why don’t
      they? I need a little break ‘round this time sometimes, anyway. Thanks
      again for the breakfast, little buddy.” I watch as he takes his coffee mug
      from the table, and see it disappear behind the newspaper before he gulps
      and places it back. All of this is pretty much standard procedure any time
      he comes here. He takes a break for thirty minutes for breakfast, he reads
      the paper, he chats, and he goes out. He used to do this at my folks’
      place back when I was in high school too, and he saw fit to bring the
      tradition here, not that I mind. “I’m sure the SDF would just completely
      botch it all up anyway. You’re the best detective the Metro Police has.”
      “Eh, I’m not so sure about that. But whatever the case, a man has limits,
      and I’m pretty sure hauling a three year old case out of the graveyard to
      haunt the motherfucker who tried to solve it is damn near toeing the
      line.” He quickly closes the newspaper and folds it as he continues. “God,
      I just need to talk about this to someone that ain’t police. Listen,
      Mikiya, what I’m about to tell you is really classified stuff, but I trust
      you. Don’t even think about telling it to your friends or family, you got
      it?” I nod. Though I wouldn’t think of letting anything of what he’s about
      to say leak out, he’s obviously never heard of the story about King Midas
      and his donkey ears. He begins. “Right, so like last time, this one’s a
      complete stone whodunit. No suspects, which means no motive. No
      connections. Only one weak-ass witness, even in the killing spree in the
      past seven days. Last time, the only leads we got were your school emblem
      and the perp’s skin, which didn’t bingo a match in the offender database.
      But…well, I’m not sure just yet, but he might be changing up his game.”
      “Why do you say that?” “Well, you know how he’s been nabbing citizens
      since last fall, right? We weren’t sure yet that it was him back then, so
      the media didn’t latch on to the story until the killings started this
      year, when he started getting sloppy. Especially in the past week.”
      “Leaving evidence, you mean,” I suggest. “Which is weird, right? We can’t
      put a face to the fucker for four years going now, but now he decides to
      change his pattern? Doesn’t sound right. It might just be a copycat.” “But
      that can’t be right,” I muse, thinking back on how Daisuke described it to
      me four years ago. “The exact manner of how the victims died hasn’t been
      leaked to the public. I only know because you told me. If this guy was a
      copycat, he couldn’t have known exactly how to conduct the murders.”
      “Yeah, I know, I know,” Daisuke says with a resigned sigh. “I wonder,
      though. The murders four years ago struck me as less ritualistic and
      more…like someone who was just getting used to what he could do, and he
      decided to play around, you know? He was at least leaving a body to be
      found back then. Now…” he clears his throat, and shakes his head, as if to
      rid his mind of a self-made image, before he continues. “…now he’s just
      leaving severed arms or legs. If he’s trying to clean up his act, then why
      take all that time to hide a body but leave the limbs intentionally?”
      “Calling card, maybe? A signature for the police to know him by? He’s
      gloating,” I think out loud. “Yeah, that’s where my mind automatically
      goes, too. But it didn’t look like the limbs were cut, that’s for sure.
      There’s no clean cut, or even the signs of multiple attempts to hack them
      off. They look like they were…torn off, or twisted right out.” Daisuke
      smiles then, and makes a chuckle, the heaviness in his features leaving
      him for a moment. “Heh, heard any escaped alligator urban legends out
      there lately, Mikiya?” “Nah,” I say, chuckling now too. “If I do, though,
      you can get lost. I’m keeping it as a pet just to spite you.” I drink from
      my coffee now too, the temperature finally becoming agreeable. I use the
      moment to hide my expression when my mind wanders to four years ago…and
      Shiki. It was four years ago when Shiki told me she was a murderer. But
      that couldn’t have been true. I can’t believe she would kill anyone. Not
      truly. She was never ready to swing that knife down on anybody. I’ve
      always put my faith in her. But, if that’s true, then why does my mind now
      go back to thoughts of her? “Your witness,” I say quickly, as if doing so
      would banish the thought from my mind. “You said you had a weak one.
      What’s that about?” “Yeah, from last week’s incident downtown over at
      commercial. Place is packed full of people at most hours so it must have
      been pretty hard for the killer to hide what he was doing. Sure enough,
      even though the crime scene was an alley, someone passed by. Witness
      managed to see the perp booking it after the murder took place, said he
      wore a kimono. Actually though, the witness can’t say for certain whether
      the suspect was actually a guy or a girl. Like I said, no legs on that
      info just yet.” Daisuke shrugs as he says this, and rests his head on a
      hand propped up on the table. “It’d be nice if we can at least bring in
      some viable targets for questioning. The brass is pretty hung up on
      getting the ‘monster’ and tying this up quick. Far as I know, the
      pressure’s coming all the way from city hall.” “A red ball. Media coverage
      is getting kinda crazy hysterical too.” “Best road to stress, I tell ya.
      Gotta thank you for this, Mikiya.” “It’s why I’m here.” Yet even as
      Daisuke shares the new information about what the witness saw, he returns
      it unknowingly to Shiki. Who else do I know that walks around at night in
      a kimono? My fingers clutching the coffee cup seem to go numb for a
      moment, but I manage to retain my composure. “One more thing I gotta ask
      you,” says Daisuke, adopting a more hushed tone now. “Now Mikiya, I know
      you know your fair share about the drug trade here in Tokyo. Whoever’s
      slinging the best shit, who the players are, that sort of thing.” “I guess
      so,” I venture hesitantly. “I mean, more than the average person, sure.
      But I’m sure you’ve got a pool of guys over at your narcotics bureau
      better acquainted with that than me.” He waves a hand in the air
      dismissively. “A bunch of conservative old hacks playing at understanding
      what games the kids play now, and deluding themselves that buy-busts are
      the ultimate answer. That includes me.” He gives a mocking chuckle before
      pulling out a polaroid photograph from his coat pocket, setting it down on
      the table for me to see. In the photograph are two evidence bags, one
      containing something that looks like a bunch of stamps, and another with
      some kind of grass inside. The labels on the bags have the words
      “mescaline” and “THC” written prominently on them, alongside how many
      grams of it is stored, and below that is the chain of custody for the
      evidence. I recognize them easily enough. “The stamps are LSD, right? The
      other is weed I’m pretty sure.” “Well, kinda like weed. The forensics guys
      told me that the THC and CHC content in the hemp are very low.” “So it’s
      not marijuana.” It can’t have been. You would have to have enough THC, the
      psychoactive substance found in weed, for it to qualify. “It’s probably
      something more like tochigishiro.” “Which is what?” “A specially bred
      strain of hemp developed here in Japan. Because hemp growing is regulated
      heavily by the prefectural governments, they’ve got a pretty strict
      ceiling on how much THC should be in usable hemp, which is at 1%. The hemp
      that used to be grown natively here in Japan usually sat at around 1.2 to
      1.8%. So, to comply with the new prefectural policies, they developed a
      low-THC strain in Hiroshima, called tochigishiro. Obviously it didn’t stop
      illegal plantations or smuggling of marijuana inside the country.” Daisuke
      nods, his eyes showing their characteristic concentration. He’s following
      along with a genuine curiosity now. “So what does the picture have to do
      with anything?” I ask. “Most of the murder victims this past week had some
      in their possession on time of death,” Daisuke explains. “But hey, what do
      I know? They’re kids fooling around at night so maybe it’s no surprise,
      eh?” “Unfair generalizations aren’t going to get you anywhere, Daisuke.”
      “Which is why I’m turning to you for opinions. You know these street
      hoppers better than I do.” “To be honest, I don’t really know about that.
      I haven’t been in contact with any of the street level dealer guys for at
      least half a year. They might have changed up their boys, especially the
      guys who sell acid. They do rotations so they don’t get caught so easily.
      The cocktail slingers too.” “Cocktails are two drugs mixed together in one
      dose, right?” “Yeah. I hear the popular thing right now is speedballs:
      when they mix cocaine with heroine or morphine in one needle. Powerful
      stuff. Very dangerous too, if you aren’t careful.” Daisuke narrows his
      eyes. “You’re suspiciously knowledgeable about all this. You aren’t taking
      any, are you?” he asks. Though I’m pretty sure he isn’t serious, I decide
      to answer him truthfully anyway. “Do I look like I do? If I was a dope
      fiend, you’d know it with one look at me. I’m a pretty easy guy to read,
      or so people tell me. I’m not one to try drugs. I’ve just got a…well, an
      old high school friend who knows a lot about it.” “Fine, fine, I believe
      you,” he says dismissively as he stands up, though it doesn’t escape my
      notice that he noted my hesitation in saying Gakuto’s name. “Anyway, gotta
      get back to work soon or they’ll light my ass up. Last question, though.
      Is weed an upper or a downer?” I sigh, thinking regretfully on how little
      this supposed detective uncle of mine knows about the whole thing, despite
      being on the job for years now. “That’s a question I’m sure even your
      narcotics people can answer, but whatever. It actually isn’t clear what
      weed is. Different people have different reactions. For some it’s a
      stimulant, and to others it’s a downer, and also a hallucinogen. For a few
      people, it doesn’t even leave any strong effect. Other drugs have been
      extensively studied and their effects documented, but the THC in weed is
      the only thing that remains a mystery.” “Heh, thanks for that. I’m a
      homicide guy, not in narcotics, so I don’t know everything about it,” he
      says as he grabs and puts on his coat. “I’ll be sure to bone up on it,
      though. Looks like I’m gonna need it soon enough if the stuff keeps
      getting found on victims. Might be enough to form an angle on the case.”
      He gives me a short wave as he walks toward the entrance of the house, and
      I wave him back. He opens the door, admitting the noise of raindrops
      assaulting the rooftops of the buildings outside. “God, fucking rain
      again?” Daisuke complains as he heads out and closes the door behind him.
      “Just has to spill the beans to me, doesn’t he?” I whisper to myself. The
      conversation with him left a gloomy undercurrent to the room, though, and
      as the dreary dawn light peeks in through the window, I finish my
      breakfast and get a sudden urge to take the day off. I quickly call Miss
      Tōko up and inform her. Her reply is curt. “Whatever you plan on doing,
      take it easy.” She says it like an order, not a mere suggestion. Before I
      get a chance to assure her, there is a click on the line; she’s put the
      phone down. She knows what I’m up to for sure. She’s always had strangely
      accurate intuition. There’s only one good reason I need the day off today.
      I haven’t seen any sign of Shiki for a week now. The past week had seen a
      new murder turn up every day, and since it all started, she hasn’t come
      back to her room, or her old Ryōgi family estate. I can’t get in touch
      with her, and nobody I know seems to have seen her. It doesn’t take a
      genius to see what reason she could have for doing it. If the murderous
      monster really is the same serial killer from four years ago, then Shiki
      is out there, searching for answers. But I don’t even know who this
      monster prowling the streets is. And I know that the memories related to
      her old Shiki personality have all vanished along with him, which means
      we’ll never be able to prove if she was related to those crimes or not.
      Maybe I’m not the one that can break this case wide open. But there are
      far too many memories that will be betrayed if I wait any longer. Shiki’s
      disappearance heralds something far worse. I can feel it. And before that
      happens, I need to find the truth. Me. Because this isn’t someone else’s
      problem. From four years ago until today, this has always been mine and
      Shiki’s problem. We just kept prolonging it, afraid to face it. So to
      understand it, I need to start investigating, not for someone else, but
      for my own sake. I step outside the house, seeing the rain cover
      everything in an unceasing grey veil. I pop open my black umbrella and
      travel to the crime scenes of the past week. I reach last night’s spot, an
      alley in one of the busier portions of downtown. People are walking the
      sidewalk as if nothing had happened last night, trying not to notice the
      alley which still has policemen standing guard and yellow police lines
      stretched over the mouth of the entrance, and a similarly yellow tarp
      covering the top of the entire alleyway. Preserving the crime scene for at
      least a day, they can do no more than that. I leave, and head to the other
      crime scenes, hoping to find them less guarded. Luckily, the police have
      abandoned them, and I’m able to pry through them without notice. By the
      time I reach my third crime scene, I barely notice that much of the day
      has passed, and it is already early afternoon. If I wanted to pay all the
      places a visit and give them a thorough search, it’d probably take me
      until late tonight. This is all useless. The crime scenes are open and
      they’re more than likely already tampered, if not through daily traffic,
      then surely through the continuous day of rain. But without a single clue,
      what can I really do? This investigation is kid’s stuff for now, but
      before I take it up a notch, I have to make sure not to leave a stone
      unturned. And so with just my umbrella for company, I wander alleyways
      tainted by murder. The late winter rain is icy cold, and hasn’t let up the
      entire day. The rain in this month has always had a special melancholy
      attached to it for me. It’s had that for me for three years. After all, it
      was this month, three years ago, when I lost her. *** “I…I want to kill
      you.” It was a very gentle smile. The girl in the red kimono had a knife
      pointed at me, hovering above my neck. In one terrifyingly brief moment,
      Ryōgi raised the blade. I, lying on the ground while she straddled me,
      could do nothing but to look into the eyes of my coming death. Like a
      guillotine, the knife blade shone in the rain, and she brought it down in
      a strike swift and true. But the knife did not pierce my neck, did not
      strike home in my flesh, but instead stopped unsteadily an inch or two
      before making its mark. “Why?” whispered in a voice incredulous and
      unbelieving. The totality of the question was left unvoiced. Why can’t I
      kill you? In that moment, I felt the fear ebbing away slowly, replaced
      with a growing pity at this girl, whose existence was at once given
      meaning by a desire for murder and her disgust of it. For a moment, I
      forgot to breathe. But it was only for one, lucky moment. I saw her look
      at her own arm, and in those eyes there was nothing but anger and contempt
      at her own actions. She took her other hand, letting it clutch her blade
      arm, as if to force it to action. This time, I thought, this time it will
      be the end. But something interrupted us. A man approached beside us,
      seeming to come from nowhere at all, wearing a great black coat like a
      monk. With a single small gesture of his hand, she sent flying from me,
      using some unseen force. He spoke. “Fool. This weakening does not become
      you,” he said in a low, tormented voice. The man helped me up, his strong
      grip on my arm lifting me effortlessly. That seemed to awaken some
      predatory instinct in who pulled herself up from the rain-soaked ground,
      and launched herself toward the man with redoubled vigor. In an instant,
      was beside the tall man, jumping up and aiming her knife at his forehead,
      and slashed in one quick motion. A thin red line ran through his forehead
      then, and blood poured out slowly like sand. After she slashed him,
      quickly ran past him, and retreated to a distance he could not reach. They
      glared at each other, the tall man in the black coat barely even
      registering he was wounded. Amused, he even gave an observant chuckle.
      “Would you stay your hand even for me? Then you are still useless to me.”
      The man then took me by the arm and ran. Behind us, gave chase. But the
      man’s speed is too fast, almost as if we were flying. But we couldn’t have
      been, because my feet were still on the ground, struggling to keep up with
      him. Eventually, we were out of the Ryōgi estate’s grounds, and only then
      did he let go of me. Then he looked at me, as if to say that if I went
      home now, all would be safer for me. “Far too early to break her,” he
      murmured, but even his murmurs were a low audible rumble. “The duality of
      the spiral of conflict has always been her destined end.” Leaving me with
      those words, the man walks away and disappears with only a few steps, as
      if letting the shadows of the surrounding bamboo grove swallow him. The
      asphalt road home stretched out welcomingly before me, but behind me, I
      could hear fast approaching. I could’ve gone home. I could’ve left her.
      But I chose to be with her. I still don’t know if that was the right thing
      to do. But in the end, she couldn’t swing the knife down. I turned without
      reluctance to the sound of her approaching footfalls. And when she caught
      up to me, there was surprise in her face, but more than that, there was
      confusion. Then a burning clarity. There were words exchanged then, words
      that couldn’t be forgotten. But her last sentence to me was this. “If I
      can’t make you go away,” she said, under the unceasing rain. In the
      distance, closing fast, she spots the headlights of an approaching car.
      She laughed. A weak, bitter laugh. “I have to make myself go away.” She
      runs toward the middle of the street. The car approached fast, and she
      presented herself in front of it, lit brightly on one side by the
      headlights. The rain fell hard, but even it could not overcome the keening
      sound of the brakes. It was too late. It was over in a second. The girl
      who fell in the wet asphalt looked less like , and more like some
      lifeless, warmthless doll, broken and ruined. Right there, at that moment,
      I knew no more painful and regretful moment. Her eyes before the impact
      had tears in them—or was it just the rain? And yet, even having seen that,
      I could not find it in myself to cry. *** The evening only brings more
      rain and less clues than I had hoped for, but is only in line with what I
      expected. It is cold tonight, more so than the past ones have been. A good
      thing I brought my umbrella. The black umbrella…the same one I was using
      when I first met Shiki. She had been looking up at the sky that night, but
      seemed to see neither the stars nor the moon, as if she had frozen in
      place, and all was right with the world.
