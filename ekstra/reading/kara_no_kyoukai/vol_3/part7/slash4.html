    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - /4</h1>
    <p>
      - August. - - Alaya was right. - - I am perfect. - - None can blame me for
      murder. It is as inevitable as the rising of the sun. The gift of
      delirium. - The rain is pouring. I open my eyes to the pitter-patter of
      the rain on the roof; a low, muffled rumble. “Huh. Still alive,” I
      observe, my voice dulled. The next thing I feel is the concrete underneath
      my back, before I realize that I’m lying down, which makes it feel awkward
      for a moment. I raise my head a bit, my vision still swimming, to look at
      what’s in front of me. Green. The weed, all over the warehouse. And
      suddenly I remember where I am. I look up at the windows on the roof.
      Sunlight streams through them, but dulled and colorless from the heavy
      rain. Still, the light that does get through is surprisingly intense, so
      much so that much of the place seems to be lighted quite well, albeit with
      a tint of dismal purgatory that helps little with the gloom of the garden.
      And so here I lie. My last memory takes a while to resurface, but I
      suppose Leo Shirazumi knocked me out. My hands are bound by steel
      handcuffs, an my entire body feels slackened and weak. Due to some drug,
      I’d imagine. Even my consciousness doesn’t seem to be a sure thing right
      now. My mind is empty. All I know is that I’m here, cuffed and lying on a
      concrete floor, fighting between dreaming and waking, and barely able to
      see or focus on anything except the silhouettes of the lazy trailing of
      fallen winter raindrops on the roof skylight. I only notice then how cold
      it is in here. It’s the damn drug he shot in my body. I close my eyes for
      a moment, and my mind almost immediately reels back to a memory that has
      been weighing so heavily on me recently. A memory from three years ago,
      from what feels like a distant and completely separate life. *** The rain
      was pouring. The night was so cold that it felt like it could shatter
      bones as easily as frozen ice. Unsheltered from the rain, gave chase to
      Mikiya Kokutō. She ran, relying on the faint shimmer of streetlight
      piercing through the veil of pouring rain to guide her way. The wet
      asphalt reflected the ethereal light, even as shadows danced upon its
      surface. ran desperately. That man in the black coat had spirited Mikiya
      away earlier, but now he saw him just ahead, standing alone, no help
      forthcoming. When she had caught up to him, she brandished her knife
      again. The boy could not find his words, nor could he run, for had earlier
      slashed at his leg. The blood from that slash still flowed, leaking down
      onto the asphalt and mixing with the rain. Yet now, as she had Mikiya in
      her grasp, when one slash could spell his death, she hesitated. “Why?”
      whispered to herself. “Why?!” she repeated, shouting it in a rage. She
      could feel the bile rising in her throat. They faced each other then, both
      wearing a strained expression. “When I’m with you, it’s always so hard.
      You show me what I can never have, but my madness grows each day. So…I
      have to kill you. So that this illusion you’ve given me can just fade! So
      that I can stop believing in lies! So I can go back to what I was again!”
      She cried out, her voice clear even in the din of the rainfall. It was a
      child’s voice that shouted then, confused and close to tears at what had
      been thrust upon her, angry and full of self-loathing. And even in the
      endless gray veil of the rain, Mikiya could see the tears trailing from ’
      eyes. He struggles to find the words for a reply. Inside , a presence—her
      friend and tormentor, Shiki—whispered silent thoughts into her mind. All
      people dream, . How heartless can you be to stop yourself from doing it?
      How much more pain can you endure? And after those words, she could feel
      the familiar sensation of letting herself slip, of the other consciousness
      sliding into the part of her mind that governed. And in the end, ’
      murderous impulse was halted neither by herself nor Mikiya. Because it was
      Shiki, always asleep, always the dreamer, that didn’t want to destroy the
      dream of an existence with Mikiya. Because no matter how impossibly
      distant it may be, or how painful its idea, it was as important a reason
      to live as anything. So, it would stay, because its extinguishing would
      only hurt more. But was confused, unable to taken any more. It would be up
      to Shiki, then. The girl, controlled now by something else, took a slight
      step back, still facing Mikiya. Another small step, closer out into the
      main road behind her. Headlights rushed headlong from a distance, the beam
      of light dulled somewhat by the rain. That is when she decided, when the
      car was close enough to hear the roar of its engine. Mikiya never realized
      the simplicity of the answer. “If I can’t make you go away…I have to make
      myself go away,” she said like a prayer. She offered a smile in those last
      moments: a gentle, earnest, and happy smile, but fleeting and soon to
      fade. And in the next moments, the headlights grew blinding and bathed her
      in light. She welcomed it. The sound of brakes shrieked through the
      midnight air, but it was far too late. She flew. *** I had forgotten the
      memory for so long, but as that mage Kurogiri said, it always lurks inside
      of you. It doesn’t fade away or wither. I was supposed to die that night,
      and the one who would wake from the coma would have been Shiki. But in
      those last moments, he took my consciousness, and he became the sacrifice.
      It was the only way he knew to protect his dream. He knew what would
      happen. He knew that if he was left in this body, that he would have
      nothing holding him back from the murder that was the focal point of his
      existence. And he entrusted me to make that dream real. After all, he
      could do nothing but sleep in his brief existence. I was the one who ruled
      my body, and as long as I kept that control, he would always be asleep. He
      was dangerous as a beast, cornered and lashing out if let loose, and
      always bound by his nature as a murderous monster. Without it, he couldn’t
      be. And yet we harbored a mutual dream; a dream of normal existence. And
      it wasn’t so strange if I think about it. After all, weren’t we the same,
      with the same upbringing, the same experiences? It’s not so big a stretch
      to see why we’d yearn for the same thing. But I was able to maintain the
      masquerade of normality; Shiki couldn’t. He was the paradox of my
      existence: to scorn other people, but to hold the desire to be one of them
      as well. He’ll never get to see his dream of me living content and whole
      now. His only dream, contradicting his existence, thrust onto me. The
      dream we had met that March day, the classmate that Shiki had grown to
      like. The one who, I had fervently hoped, would lead me to that seemingly
      impossible path. Shiki knew how it would all end if he had remained inside
      me, how Mikiya’s existence would always threaten how I’d always lived, and
      how the contradiction would drive me insane, how it would lead to me
      killing him. Our dream, crushed by my own hands. Shiki saw that end, and
      chose the only way out. Above all things, it was him that had to disappear
      to protect our dream. So for Shiki, the dream goes on. That’s why I want
      Mikiya to always remember Shiki. Because now, this life is the dream Shiki
      had always fixed his eyes upon. It’s why I speak like him, to remind
      everyone of the man that was just as close a part to me as my own heart.
      The rain doesn’t stop, and doesn’t look like it will any time soon. My
      mind is still a dim blur, still snatching at half-remembered memories of
      dual personalities, and of emotions long kept. Yet it is a helpful fever
      dream. When Shiki died, no one lit a candle for him. No one prepared a
      vigil. Not even me. I think I never truly accepted his death. But now I
      realize, in this final memory that he left me, it is time to finally let
      him pass. This is my vigil to my first friend. I remember his last
      thoughts, before that car made me tumble and break. Thank you. But I’d
      never think of killing you. It wasn’t said to me, but to Mikiya, who
      watched helplessly that night with arms held outstretched toward me.
      Murder was his only way of understanding, his last method of connecting
      with another. But Shiki couldn’t even say his last words to the man who
      had deserved them.
