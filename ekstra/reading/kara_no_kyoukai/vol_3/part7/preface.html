    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - Preface</h1>
    <p>
      Only our frozen sighs played between us As we watch our heartbeats fade
      slowly into stillness Soon, all of the dear and treasured memories Will
      become mere regrets, weak and soon to fade. Even the memory of rain: Of an
      endless gray veil seen after school Even the memory of sunset: Of a
      classroom ablaze in orange light Even the memory of snow: Of the white
      night of first contact, and the black umbrella Beside me you would smile,
      and that would be enough To bid my soul rest, turbulent though it was
      Beside me you would walk, and that would be enough To bid the rift between
      us close, distant though it was Once, a moment in time We stopped for
      shade, warm unmoving sunlight peeking through leaves And there, as you
      laughed, you said that one day we’d stand in the same place They were
      words that I’ve yearned to hear for so long But now it is but the fleeting
      remains of the day
