    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - VII</h1>
    <p>
      The world disappeared. That’s what I first thought. I cough, spitting out
      something liquid from what feels like it had come from inside my chest.
      Somewhere inside my body, something still isn’t allowing me to die. The
      first things I discover I can move are my arms, and then my upper body
      follows suit. My legs move, but only a little. They feel asleep, and no
      matter how much I try, I can’t move them as strongly as I’d like. I creep
      along to the nearest wall beside me, clasp a hand firmly on a windowsill,
      and pull myself up, the wall largely doing much of the work of supporting
      me. Eyesight is returning, but everything is mists and shadow, the
      outlines of things shocked with white and red. My sense of pain still
      struggles to keep up. It hurts somewhere in my body. I can’t rightly place
      where exactly, but somewhere there is a dull, throbbing pain. And then I
      remember. I place a hand on my left eye, and it comes away wet and red. No
      small amount of blood. Yet strangely the pain is less pronounced than I’d
      expected. The bleeding surprisingly isn’t as bad as anticipated either.
      The drugs that Shirazumi gave me had some influence on that, maybe? Still,
      the wound itself is hideous to feel. The last memory I have before falling
      unconscious was the knife, carving its way from my forehead to left cheek,
      slicing up my left eye along its path. It’s probably too late to save it.
      It’s a miracle that I’m even still alive, and that my right eye didn’t die
      along with the left. With a hand on the wall to steady myself, I carefully
      make my way inch by inch to the stairs leading up to the main warehouse
      floor, and climb up, having to mostly drag my legs as I hold the bannister
      and pull myself step by step. Upstairs, I find the floor overrun with
      grass. I can’t readily identify what they are, and at this point I really
      don’t care. Even in the pain and the blood and the anesthetic effect of
      the drugs, there is only one thought on my mind. “Shiki,” the word is on
      my lips, like a prayer. Without a wall to cling to, it becomes much more
      difficult to walk. The warehouse is cavernous, and the plants only
      compound my lack of keen eyesight. I take my first step, and immediately
      fall to the ground. A flash of pain shoots through my entire body, and the
      world is black again for a moment before all returns like before, and I
      find myself on the ground. What am I doing? Stuck in some bloodied,
      battered, wounded, and bruised body, in some kind of limbo between life
      and death. I can only hope that the fall didn’t open some already closed
      wounds. The ground beneath me is soil. With my knees having buckled and
      offering no more strength, I have no choice but to crawl upon it. It’s
      only then that I realize the enormity of the structure I’m in, and how
      little I am, and how much the grass can hinder vision at this height. My
      left eye feels like it’s being burned with hot pincers, my right eye shows
      me images of wraith-like outlines, and I can do nothing to remedy it. Out
      of breath, I stop for a moment. Shiki being here was only a hunch on my
      part anyway. I have to pace my progress unless I want to kill myself. So I
      advance slowly, trying to calm my thoughts. Should I find Shiki already
      crossing blades with Leo Shirazumi, what am I supposed to do then? Kill
      Shirazumi, and there’s no going back. That’s what I said to her. No going
      back. I never wanted her to commit murder. Because I love her. And I want
      to keep on loving her. I only wanted to give her joy. I didn’t want her to
      cause pain to anyone anymore. Call it selfishness. Yet even she detests
      murderers. Once, I said I believed in her. I wonder if that’s still true,
      or if they were always just convenient words I used to hide something.
      Whatever the case, I have to believe in her now, and in the possibility
      that maybe, she can come back, despite my words. At a snail’s pace, I cut
      through the grass, heading towards what I think is the center of the
      entire place. Eventually, my arms chance upon a plot of ground that isn’t
      soil, but concrete. I find myself at a wide path where none of the grass
      grows, and it is here, in the center of it all, that I find Shiki. Beside
      her is the body of Leo Shirazumi, intact but still as a grave. At a
      distance and at first glance, there is no sign of life from either. So
      what I thought was true. Shirazumi is dead by your hands, Shiki. For the
      moment, I set aside the thought. For now, I have to know what happened to
      her. With great difficulty, I manage to pull myself that last stretch to
      where she lies. Her eyes are closed, her face seems finally at peace. Her
      body is wounded greviously on her legs, her waist, and an arm, and her
      clothes and skin is dirtied with blood, sweat, and dirt. Her face is pale,
      and there is little warmth in her frail body…and yet, her chest rises and
      falls with a measured pace. Alive. Relieved, I turn my attention now
      toward Leo Shirazumi. In the state he is in, there is no doubt he is dead.
      I am sorry old friend. No matter what situation you had found yourself in,
      you did not deserve to die. But you are the only one who died today, and
      the only victim among us three that has a right to be mourned. But still,
      that does not stop me from being happy at Shiki being alive. I do not pity
      you. On the contrary, I curse you. It is only because of you that Shiki
      had to perform her terrible act. A pale, slender finger touches my cheek,
      caressing it, lightly tracing over skin and blood. It was her finger. “Are
      you crying, Kokutō?” Shiki says as she regards me with faint, sleepy eyes.
      There is a welcome surprise on her face as her hand reaches out softly to
      feel the wound on my cheek, and the ruined eye. The white fingers turn
      red. Shiki tries to rise, but grunts, and gives up the effort. And I’m in
      no state to carry her out of here. So we lie there for a while, facing
      each other, taking in the face of the other. In the rain, only our frozen
      sighs play between us, As we watch our breaths fade slowly into silence.
      “I killed Shirazumi,” Shiki whispers. “Yeah,” I nod. She turns to face the
      remains of Leo Shirazumi one last time, looking at the terrible thing she
      can be capable of, then turns back toward the sky outside the window.
      “There’s so much I’ve lost, and so much I’ve left to lose,” she says in a
      sad, empty voice. She thinks she’s lost what’s important, and lost herself
      in the process. Maybe she even thinks she’s lost me. It’s as her
      grandfather told her once. And following those words, she thinks she will
      meet death alone, in a desolate place. “It doesn’t matter now. I told you
      once before, didn’t I? I’ll carry it in your place.” A drop of blood from
      my ruined eye falls to Shiki’s face, a red tear for a sinner. It was last
      summer when I swore that to you as you smiled for the first time under the
      rain. I said that I’ll carry your sins in your place. So I’ll keep it
      inside of me. And until the day you die, you’ll never be alone again. “But
      I’m a murderer.” This voice is faint, barely a whisper above the air,
      blaming only herself, and close to tears like a child’s. She knows that
      the sin will never truly disappear, and no matter how much she asks for
      forgiveness, her sorrow is ultimately up to her. Even I wonder if
      forgiveness can come to me, and it will be a harder question for other
      people. “I told you that murder is the last line you cross. And still you
      went ahead and crossed it. Just can’t learn, can you? Maybe I’m just a
      little cross. And don’t think crying will get you out of this one.” “Huh.
      You’re a heartless piece of work.” “Yeah. Your little tricks aren’t going
      to work.” And that’s it. With those words, that distinctive manner of how
      she says her words, I know that she’s back. She knows it too. There is a
      tranquility to her now. She smiles the littlest smile, and closes her eyes
      in relief, so calmly that you’d think she’s asleep. Another red tear falls
      to her cheek. I take the dirtied and bloodied girl under my nearly numb
      arm, cradling her shoulders as I help her get up. And I move to embrace
      her, to hold her tight against me so strongly, as if death itself was
      coming for us both and it would be the last thing I could leave to her.
      And in that embrace, I promise her something. “Shiki…I’ll never let go of
      you again.” The words fade away into the endless rain. Perhaps the words
      didn’t matter. Perhaps they never did. Perhaps all that matters is that I
      can hold her close to me now, and that her arms wrap themselves tightly
      around my back, returning my embrace with the brief strength that I can
      feel in her fingertips.
