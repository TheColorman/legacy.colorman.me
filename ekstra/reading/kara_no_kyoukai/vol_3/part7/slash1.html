    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - /1</h1>
    <p>
      141/ 1 - May. - - I’ve become acquainted with Mikiya Kokutō. I knew I’d
      like him ever since I first saw him. He talked to me without reservation
      or hesitation, with a smile uncalculating or plotting. He’s perfect. -
      “More rain again?” I grumble as I seek cover from the growing intensity of
      the shower. The volume of the raindrops as they impact the roofs of the
      buildings starts to build towards a crescendo. Luckily, a nearby
      convenience store provides some temporary shelter, and of course, the
      umbrella bin outside proves to be a welcome convenience indeed. I help
      myself to one umbrella, a cheap plastic one the owner is unlikely to miss
      fondly. My objective is lost, though. Hard to track the smell of blood
      mixed with the rain. Still, there’s nothing to be gained from standing
      here the entire day, so I continue to walk. It’s February 8, and dawn is
      just breaking. The streets still lack their usual foot or vehicle traffic,
      and the silhouettes of people I share the street with are few and far
      between. Even my own shadow, projected by the dim lights of the passing
      neon and fluorescent, feels like a hazy illusion, almost incomprehensible
      in the rain. After putting some distance between myself and the generous
      convenience store, I stop for a while to take stock of myself. I’ve got a
      cheap plastic umbrella, borrowed; a wet and dirtied leather jacket, and a
      pretty good kimono soiled by thick dirt and mud at the hem and waist.
      Well, I can’t really expect to be clean after spending a week sleeping
      exclusively on alleys. My appearance is one thing, but my odor is entirely
      another. And man, I smell exactly like three-day old sweat. “Sleeping
      outside has got to stop today,” I whisper to myself, a suggestion that,
      the way I say it, almost makes it sound like some kind of fun game. For
      the first time in a week, I laugh. My name is Shiki Ryōgi. Like the Taoist
      term “ryōgi” used to describe the duality of yin and yang. Yeah, my family
      is weird, and I’m sort of a chip off the old block. Once, I nursed another
      personality within me, a male one called Shiki. Same pronunciation,
      different ideogram. I’d been saddled with him since birth, a murderous
      personality cultivated by my strange lineage. And so since birth, I’ve
      always known of the pleasure he derived from the thought of murder. It was
      his passion. And in a sort of twisted way, it became mine too, as I
      pressed down on the dark impulse inside me, killing it over and over again
      to control it. I killed the self inside of me, sensing both the pleasure
      it gave me, and the pain. All so I could live a parody of a normal life.
      Murder defined me then, if not literally then figuratively. But there was
      always the threat of it, lurking in the rafters, tempting me with its
      allure. When I was a child, perhaps the only thing that held me in check
      were the words of my grandfather. While my father was without a doubt a
      Ryōgi, he did not inherit the “blessing,” as he liked to call it. So of
      course, when I was born, there was no prouder father, and my otherwise
      normal older brother was passed over for the right of succession. So I’ve
      been special ever since birth. Always left alone, but never lonely, always
      having the other Shiki for company. We were one, he and I; a girl and her
      shadow. So it was when I was sixteen, still fearing that I was just a mere
      tool for murder, that my grandfather passed away. Like me, he had the
      “blessing.” But he had never been able to control his other self
      completely, and in his long years, he had hurt himself, sometimes
      grievously, cursed those around him, while denying what he was. It had
      been told to me that he and his other self switched constantly, so much so
      that people forgot which was truly in control, and for twenty years, he
      had been confined to an asylum. But in his dying hours, he called for me.
      In those last moments with me, he returned to some semblance of sanity,
      and shared with me his only words for me, and his last as well. And I’ll
      never forget them. He taught me that murder was important, a great and
      terrible thing of monstrous weight. Since that day, I think I was able to
      better think on my position because of him. And perhaps my masquerading of
      life, while forever alone, might be accomplished after all. Until I met
      Mikiya Kokutō. When I met him in high school, it coincided with me
      starting to act very strangely. There was something about him, something
      that told me that life wasn’t a thing to hide in, but to live through. I
      remember thinking that all would have been better, if I hadn’t known. If
      he wasn’t a promise of something far better, something I wanted that could
      also destroy me. I couldn’t fool myself anymore after him, and neither
      could I fool Shiki. He broke me apart, and me and Shiki started to become
      more out of sync. When once, I knew exactly what I was doing when Shiki
      was in control, he eventually hid it from me, and I could recall nothing
      of what happened when he was in control. I would oftentimes come to my
      senses in the middle of the night, a bloody soaked body lying in front of
      me, and I, smiling. I didn’t know if the serial killer that haunted the
      city then was me, or I just wandered into his work afterwards. Doubt
      started to creep in. Eventually, Mikiya found me in the middle of such a
      scene, but he still believed in me, and trusted that I wasn’t the killer.
      And it was then that I decided that his joy was just an impossible dream
      to tempt me. There was a confrontation between us. And then the accident,
      which resulted in my two-year coma. When I awakened, I found myself unlike
      my previous self in small yet important ways. I had lost Shiki, my
      steadfast companion, taking his share of the memories along with him. As
      for the memories of my old self, they felt empty and vague, like someone
      else’s experiences. I was hollow, like a doll. And since then, I’ve been
      trying to fill up that hollow in my soul that Shiki left inside me with
      new things. It’s probably the greatest irony that the guy responsible for
      that going pretty well in the past half-year has to be Mikiya Kokutō, the
      same guy almost drove me to ruin. I’m not an empty doll anymore. But now,
      something’s happening that’s bringing back the sins of the past. When I
      awakened, Shiki’s memories were lost to me, when he “died.” Though I don’t
      really know if he has the kind of autonomy in my brain that would make it
      work, it comforts me to think that he took it with him because he thought
      it would be a blessing to me to forget about them, to live a life
      unburdened by guilt. And for the most part, he was right. Something
      happened last New Year’s though. I encountered, fought, and lost to a mage
      who, against my will, returned my lost memories to me. And so…now I
      remember everything four years ago. How my final moments before the
      accident really went down. How I fell to the most extreme solution of
      trying to murder Mikiya Kokutō, a knife pointed high above him. How I
      wandered the streets at night, spoiling for a good kill. It relieves me
      somewhat to find that it was not me who conducted the serial killings. But
      then, that leaves an obviously bigger problem of who the serial killer
      actually was. Or is, if the news tells it true and this new one is the
      same guy. I still don’t know who he is. Mikiya must already be suspecting
      me after I ran away. Hell, if you ask me, he’d have every right to. I have
      the shady past to back it up anyway. So like four years ago, I wander the
      streets again, chasing a murderous monster that’s burdening the streets
      with a new body every day. And if I must admit to myself why I do it, then
      the reason is very simple. Envy, at his willingness to snuff out a life.
      Jealousy, at the artfulness of his skill. Answers, if that were possible.
      And an end to all of this…hopefully when we decide to pounce on each
      other. We’re all the same, us murderers. We attract each other, then we
      spill our blood on the floor. It’s sort of funny in a sick sense, really.
      Four years ago, I knew it was Shiki who took pleasure from the thought of
      murder. But he’s not inside me now, is he? And yet, attracted to a
      murderous monster’s acts, I’m searching him out to murder him. Why didn’t
      I notice it before? Why did it take so long? Shiki’s only thought was
      murder, but he never acted on it. Now it’s me who’s doing it. It’s me who
      really likes it. I make my stop at a love hotel, where the front desk,
      such as it is, is non-existent; rooms are selected and bills paid through
      a machine. The better for the anonymity of their very specific clientele.
      I remember Mikiya once saying to me that if you wanted to hide from
      someone, this was a better entry-level option than most, since they don’t
      card you. Also, because of that, transactions go by really fast, which is
      better overall for me. When I get to my room, I quickly slip off my
      clothing and get into the shower, taking my time in the bath. After I’m
      done, I lie down on the bed. And though I wasn’t planning on sleeping, my
      fatigue and frustration loosens my grip on my ability to remain awake, and
      the bed is too comfortable… I wake up to a much more darkened room, the
      clock in the table beside the bed reading two in the morning. It was just
      getting dark when I got here, so I must have slept for six hours. The
      room, lit only by the lamp, and the dry digital readout of the clock, is
      populated only by strange shadows. “Fuck,” I whisper low under my breath,
      but in the noiseless room, even that can be heard. Chiding myself for
      oversleeping, I change back into my clothes angrily. It’s not just
      oversleeping that’s bothering me so much though. I’ve only been by myself
      for seven days, but why am I so irritated? It’s hasn’t been that long, has
      it? “It hasn’t,” I tell myself, as if saying it aloud would persuade me
      somehow. I leave the hotel as quickly as I entered it six hours earlier,
      my business there done. Just past 2am. Even the stone and concrete are
      asleep this time of night, but of course, the police, on the lookout for
      the murderous monster, are not. They’ll be on the lookout for anyone
      suspicious, with likely orders to pat anyone down. They’d find some pretty
      illegal stuff in my coat, so I’m not dealing with that hassle. With that
      in mind, I duck inside the nearest alleyway I can find. Every avenue in
      this area is indicted now, and the police would have the main roads
      covered, so I can’t use them. Of course, the murderous monster knows this
      too, and so like him, we travel the thieves’ highway, flitting through the
      narrow spaces between buildings. Hopefully, we meet each other. That’s the
      plan, anyway. Unfortunately, you tend to meet all sorts of people in
      alleys, and not usually the ones you’d like. “Not a dealer, man. You got
      somewhere else to be,” I say as I come to an intersection between alleys.
      Someone’s been tailing me since a few seconds ago. And now, in this
      intersection, I find more corner boys, one at my front, and two more to
      either flank. They’ve got me right in between. I look at the one in front
      of me. Slow, unsteady steps. Lazy arms. Slightly cocked head. His eyes are
      wandering a bit. This guy is totally fucking high. I cast a quick glance
      at the remaining three, and find that the same is true for all of them.
      “Well, can’t say I didn’t warn you.” They close in simultaneously, the
      entire thing obviously planned beforehand. I reach inside the pocket of my
      jacket, pulling out my blade, seven inches in all. I sigh before it all
      begins. “Well, I guess this is as good a solution for boredom as any. You
      all wanna get high, right? Fine. We’re all gonna have a different high
      tonight.” Maybe they want a quick fuck. Maybe they want some extra cash
      for dope. Maybe all they want to do is bash some skulls in. Far be it from
      me to decline that offer. At least, for a little while, I can relax, be
      the me that Shiki always wanted me to be, and lose myself in a moment of
      high. They close in on me, faster and with a purpose.
