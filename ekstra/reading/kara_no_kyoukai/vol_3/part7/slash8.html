    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - /7</h1>
    <p>
      February has come and gone, but winter still leaves its charms on the
      city. The temperature is still low, and the news even says it’s going to
      be packed with snow tomorrow. Even now, in the beginnings of March, the
      last whispers of winter can be felt seeping through the skin. Spring, it
      seems, is still a distant dream away. The murderous monster that had
      threatened the peace of the streets is dead now, found by the police to
      have died under mysterious causes. The public statement said that the
      heart just stopped, definitely before the stab wound in the chest ever
      mattered, and that anyway, it had just barely missed the heart. The
      medical examiners, perplexed, would doubtlessly have declared it some kind
      of overdose, and the stab wounds and slash marks on his body are destined
      to haunt the weeks of some poor homicide detective somewhere until the
      case was compiled in a folder and shunted to a file cabinet, cold and all
      forgotten. It was me who managed to get Mikiya to a hospital that night.
      He was too injured to really carry on. I on the other hand went to Tōko
      for a replacement hand. The thumb I had bitten off was the false
      prosthetic that Tōko had long ago provided for me, so it was an easy thing
      to replace. The household doctor of the Ryōgi knew how fast I recovered
      from these sorts of things, and recommended nothing special. Sure enough,
      I was largely recovered before February had even ended, while Mikiya is
      still in bed rest at the hospital, where he needed to stay for two weeks.
      Well, until today that is. Today is the day he finally gets out from the
      hospital that he has repeatedly made clear that he hates. And that’s why
      now, standing sheltered in the shadow of a fairly large tree outside the
      very same hospital, I brave the cold weather and wait. From here, I can
      see the national hospital’s large lobby, and I watch the cars going around
      the hospital’s elliptical driveway, pulling up and driving away as people
      come and go around the entrance. I do this for two hours until finally, I
      spot a man clad all in black make his way out of the large entrance. From
      trousers to jacket, he wears the color of his choice, his only concession
      to fashion. I see a white spot upon his arm, which surprises me for a
      moment until I discover that it’s just a bandage. When he exits the
      hospital, he turns back the last time to bow at some nurses and a doctor
      before briskly heading to where I stand. I do not call out, or wave; only
      wait. “So not even one visit to the hospital from you,” Mikiya Kokutō says
      with a playful frown on his face. “Your fool sister Azaka insisted on it.
      She said she’d kill me if I showed myself in the hospital, and I think she
      really means it.” I return his frown with an expression of disappointment.
      “Reliable sort, isn’t she?” He nods. “So, should we go? Take a cab,
      maybe?” “It’s not like there’s three football fields from here to the
      station. C’mon, it’s a short walk, and it’ll do your legs some good.”
      “Whatever works for you. I’m blaming you for any broken bones, though,” he
      adds before walking ahead. I bring myself up alongside his right and keep
      pace with him. Afterwards, everything settles into some semblance of
      routine. We talk, like we used to do, as we walk in the journey from one
      place to the next; in this case, down this gently sloping hill road as we
      head toward the train station. I chance a glimpse at Mikiya’s face. He’s
      grown his hair out, I observe. Well, the left side at the very least. His
      bangs are just long enough to cover his left eye and much of his cheek.
      “Your left eye…” My voice trails off. “Yeah, it’s gone for good. Shizune
      was right. Remember her?” “That girl with the future sight we met once,
      right? Yeah, I remember her.” “She told me something interesting once.
      That if I stayed with you, I would meet a cruel end. She was right, you
      know. My ‘eye’ certainly did.” He laughs, seemingly impressed at his own
      joke. I’m not quite sure what the proper response is to such a stupid
      joke. “My right eye’s all fine, though, so it’s not such a big thing.
      Depth perception’s going to be hard to adjust to, is all. Speaking of
      which, can you move over to my left? I’m still not used to the feeling, so
      having you on that side would make me feel a lot safer.” He doesn’t bother
      to wait for me to respond and promptly shifts himself so that I’m on his
      left side, after which he leans heavily on my shoulder. “Woah, wait, what
      the heck are you doing?” I say with just a hint of surprise. A frown
      returns to his face as he glares at me. “What? Makeshift crutch. Guess you
      gotta take care of me while I get used to this,” he explains, as if it
      were all natural. I return his glare with a sullen one of my own. “Oh,
      come on. Why do I have to be saddled with this?” “Because I want you to.
      But if you don’t want to, just say so.” Something happened to him in that
      hospital, I muse, if he’s saying all this so matter-of-factly. We stare at
      each other, and for the first time, it’s me who breaks first. I turn away
      from him, attempting to hide my wildly blushing cheeks. “Ah, it ain’t that
      bad,” I reply in a grumbling voice. Mikiya looks at me with a wry smile on
      his face. Optimism must be in his blood. And it’s getting to be so bad
      it’s genuinely infectious. “But I do need to go to school starting
      tomorrow.” “Skip classes for a day. Spring break’s coming up anyway. I’m
      sure your teachers will understand.” “What?” Sir
      I-don’t-care-you-should-be-at-school Mikiya Kokutō telling me to play
      truant? Now I know something really happened in that hospital. Maybe I’ll
      even ask him later. Right now, the only reaction I have to his statement
      is to laugh. “Hey, I was being kinda serious, though.” “I know, man, I
      know,” I laugh as I explain. “I was just thinking it’s still pretty
      selfish for you.” At that, he produces an awkward smile. “You’re right.
      Years ago, I fell in love with you without telling you. And in that
      spirit, I’m hoping you’ll let me slide butting into your life once or
      twice,” he says, without a hint of reluctance in his face. There’s a
      succinct and witty rejoinder to that somewhere in my head, but for now, I
      decide to leave it there. Because at the very least, the of the past—
      “Hmm? What’s wrong, Shiki? Ah, did that make you feel uncomfortable? You
      always told me that you didn’t like lines like that.” He sounds a bit
      disappointed. I’d planned to keep quiet, but what the hell. Just this
      once, maybe I can just say it outright to him. “That’s not necessarily
      true.” I turn away from him completely now, trying to find the courage to
      say it without making a complete idiot of myself. “ might have hated them
      once. Now…well, maybe they’re alright.” Ah, fuck. I knew it’d be
      embarrassing. I’m never letting something like that pass my lips a second
      time. I look back at him tentatively now, though it seems he’s more
      surprised than anything, as if he’d just seen a whale flying in the sky. I
      grab him firmly by the hand to break the spell. I pull him along,
      quickening our pace as we descend the slope of the hill. The station’s
      just up ahead, and through it, home. The hand that I hold responds with a
      surer strength of grip than my own, and for some reason, even that small,
      trivial thing makes me happy. I resist the urge to grin as broadly as my
      face would allow. When we reach the station, we take the train back to
      that familiar, well-worn, well-trodden city of gray towers and glass
      sentinels, of darkened streets and uncertain existences, where a hundred
      new stories are born and concluded each day. The way home is long, and
      winding; distant, and easy to lose one’s way if you don’t know your way
      around. But luckily, I have someone to share the road with. For once, my
      hand didn’t reach out for a knife. It reached out to the hand I wanted.
      And whatever the future brings, I don’t think I’ll ever let it go. And so,
      my story concludes here. I’ve made my peace with my past and my present,
      and now it’s time to live the future. All that’s left is for this season
      to end. I’ve never once truly looked forward to the ending of winter and
      the coming of spring, not once observed the importance of their passing.
      But now, I find myself watching, and waiting, with a great anticipation.
