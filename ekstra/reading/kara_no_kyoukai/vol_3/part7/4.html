    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - IV</h1>
    <p>
      - August. - - I haven’t had a wink of sleep since that night. - - I can’t
      even go outside. I’m so scared someone will see me. - - I look at myself
      in the mirror. Spoiled. Comfortable. And I hate myself for it. - - I’m the
      worst kind of person. - - Nothing seems to be worth it. I’m not even
      eating. - - Though no one has shot me, or stabbed me, or pushed me off a
      height, I am still a crumbling existence, living through the everyday like
      a man already dead. - - And after the seventh day, I realized myself that
      the man I murdered didn’t die alone that night. - - Because the reality is
      a very simple truth. - - That to murder someone means you murder yourself
      too. - By the time I’d left the harbor and went back to my apartment, it
      was already well past sunset, and dark had settled on the city. When I go
      inside the room I had not been in for a straight two days, I turn on the
      light, seeing no one inside. On the table is a map of the city, spread out
      in full. Beside it is a mug filled with barely drunk coffee. Both of them
      untouched in these past days. Only solitary air rules this place, and
      Shiki isn’t here tonight to dispel it. I sigh; involuntarily, I notice. I
      had dared to hope. After all, since January, Shiki had often come here
      without telling me, doing nothing else except talking and then sleeping,
      then leaving at morning the next day. An eccentricity she had repeated
      quite often. And I had tried to put a slim hope on such a thing happening
      when I got home, for her to be lying on my bed, as if the past few days
      had never happened. I remember going to Shiki’s old household servant,
      Akitaka, a few days ago. I was looking for any advice I could get. When I
      told him about how Shiki could often be so unpredictable, he silently
      placed a hand on my shoulder and said “I must leave the lady to you now.”
      It stymies me until now, and I couldn’t help but think at the time that it
      must have been some kind of circuitous and poorly worded compliment. Hard
      to believe that just a week or so ago, the days just came and went with me
      barely noticing. I’d always thought they’d be that way forever after what
      happened in November. Now every hour of every day passes slowly and
      trudgingly. I snap out of my reverie when the phone rings. Probably Miss
      Tōko, come to add more burdens to the soul. I can’t really blame her. I
      mean, I have been absent for three days. So, with growing apprehension at
      the kind of chewing out I might get, I pick the phone up. “Hello? Kokutō
      speaking.” In the other end of the line, I hear only a sudden gasp. And
      for some reason, it is a familiar sound, a sound of a girl I know. I take
      a wild guess. “Shiki?” There are two seconds of silence, and then... “You
      idiot,” she finally says with a tense voice, pouring all of her sneer in
      that last word. “Where the fuck have you been walking around? Maybe you
      haven’t heard, but there’s a serial killer loose. Haven’t you been
      watching the news la—” then she suddenly cuts herself off. Of course I’ve
      been watching the news. And of course, she knows what the news has been
      saying. A girl wearing a kimono. It’s exactly why I couldn’t have just sat
      on my ass and do nothing. “Fine, whatever,” she continues with a sigh.
      “You’re okay. That’s all that matters. Just stay at Tōko’s place until
      this whole mess clears over. S’all I wanted to say.” I am glad, at least,
      that she still knows how to worry. Because at least, from what I gather
      from her, we’ve been worrying together for the past few days. And yet it
      still causes some disquiet. If she knows she’s not the killer, why hasn’t
      she come home? “Shiki, where are you now?” “None of your fucking
      business.” “It is my business. You’re trying to find the serial killer,
      aren’t you?” There is a long silence, when I can hear only her light spun
      breathing. And then, a single word. “Yeah.” She says it with cold,
      murderous finality, so much that I think I must have shivered. And so what
      I’d feared is true. “Don’t do it. Shiki, just come back home. You can’t
      kill him.” “You’ve met with Shirazumi then, Mikiya. Then I gotta ask, are
      you out of your mind? What do you expect me to do? He’s given me every
      reason to kill him.” Coldness turns to a low, short laugh on the other end
      of the phone. “Shiki! Just list—” “No, you listen. I’ve got my prey. And
      he’s not going to get a chance to get away. He’s the perfect brand of
      crazy that I haven’t had the pleasure of hunting for a while now.” Perfect
      brand of crazy, she said. I remember Fujino Asagami, the killer this
      summer that committed murder out of pleasure. Now it is Leo Shirazumi, a
      murderer that kills against his own will. And she thinks them the same,
      because it’s the same murderous impulse that drives both of them; that
      drives her. The impulse of murderous monsters. “And who the hell are you
      to judge who deserves to die? How many sins does it take?” I find myself
      saying it louder than I’d intended. “Ah, finally the dulcet tones of your
      generalizations. And what kind of judge are you for people who deserve to
      live, huh? Does Leo Shirazumi, a serial killer who’s killed far too many
      people, deserve to live? He’s as fine a candidate as any for death, I’d
      say.” “Don’t be a fool here, Shiki,” I say urgently. She has to remember
      her words. “No one deserves to be murdered, and you know it. You don’t
      hold the scales here.” “What I know is that he’s beyond help. No longer
      human.” She declares plainly. Say she’s right. Maybe Leo Shirazumi can’t
      truly be called human anymore. But at his last sane moment, he said he
      wanted to be saved. “There may still be something we can do for him if we
      hurry. Just come back for now and we can talk, Shiki. Kill Shirazumi, and
      there’s no going back.” Silence, save for our frozen breaths. And long
      enough after the sentence hangs in the air, she utters her words. “I’m
      sorry. I need to.” “But why?” After a moment’s hesitation, she answers,
      her voice dry and tired. “Because we’re the same. Both murderous
      monsters.” An admission so frank, so direct. I put a hand on my temple and
      close my eyes. “No, you aren’t! I mean, you can’t even pin a single murder
      to your name.” “Luck. That’s all that is. It doesn’t change a thing. I’ve
      come to realize something, Mikiya. That four years ago, I was this close
      to murder. Because Shiki was someone who knew nothing but murder. But
      that’s it. Shiki knew murder, but that wasn’t to say that he liked it. And
      it only takes a moment to realize what comes next. That ever since I woke
      up from my coma, ever since Shiki died, something’s still digging inside
      me, shouting murder, even without him. It’s simple, really. Now I know
      that the one that truly wanted murder wasn’t Shiki, who died, but , who
      survived.” The voice on the other side lowers, cursing herself. Though it
      is little changed from her usual tone, it’s the slight difference that
      becomes painfully noticeable. “That’s why there’s nothing left for me on
      your side of the world. And that’s why you shouldn’t wait for me to come
      back.” Her voice cracks with a little chuckle, more a scoff. Is she
      crying? “You’re making another mistake, Shiki.” She doesn’t answer. I
      continue, unfazed. “You said to me some time ago that a lifetime only has
      room for one real murder. Those were your words. You believed in that. And
      you, more than anyone, know the price of murder.” After all, she had been
      suppressing—murdering, in her words—the Shiki personality ever since she
      had been a child. She knew the pain of Shiki, the victim, and of , the
      murderer. It’s why I believed in her, in the girl who always seemed to
      hide some invisible wound. “I know you won’t kill. You’re saying that you
      haven’t murdered anyone because you keep getting lucky? Don’t make me
      laugh! You’re the one that told me we make our own luck. You’ve always
      kept that impulse tucked away. Every person leans some way or the other.
      It’s just that you lean on the act of murder. But you’ve been able to hold
      it in, and that means you can keep doing it. I’m sure of it.” “What are
      you so sure of? How can you even begin to understand something even I
      don’t understand?!” she shouts, something so rare for her. But the answer
      is something I’ve long known. “I know…there’s good in you.” I know,
      because she couldn’t kill me three years ago. Shiki offers no answer, and
      it causes me to wonder where she is, what she looks like now, after seven
      days. What expression she wears as I uttered my words toward her, in that
      other world beyond the phone line. But all of it ends with words of
      parting. “You never change, Kokutō. I told you, right? always hated that
      part about you.” And after that, the phone cuts off. All I can hear now,
      is a repetitive digital noise, indicating that she had hung up. Her last
      words were the same ones that she said as she stood under the rain last
      year, at the end of summer. The clock in my room shows February 12, 7pm.
      With my dislike of leaving a job I started unfinished feeling like the
      only thing driving me forward, I soon enough forget that I had not slept
      for two days, and leave my apartment.
