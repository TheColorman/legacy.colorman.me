    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - /5</h1>
    <p>
      I dream an old, bittersweet memory. “There will come a time in any man’s
      life where he will kill.” “For true?” “Yes. And there will also come a
      time when any man can permit himself to die.” “Permit himself?” “A life is
      a life. And death is respected and feared, esteemed as the true end. All
      life is equal. And yet you cannot claim the one you hold as yours.” “Then
      what about you, grandfather?” “I can’t as well. There’s too much blood on
      these hands. I became death for so many, so I have surrendered the right
      to my own. Without anyone to pay the price for my death, all that awaits
      me is the final emptiness, and a solitary oblivion.” “So there is only
      enough for one?” “Yes. A lifetime only has room for one murder. After
      this, all of it becomes less intoned. The first is always the most
      important decision. The men who have committed massacres can never turn
      inward to kill themselves. Because their death would no longer be a human
      death.” “Is the sickness hurting you, grandfather?” “Yes, and I fear this
      is our parting. Goodbye, . May your own death be filled with peace.”
      “Grandfather? What is happening? Why do you die so lonely? Grandfather—”
      The sound of something sticky intrudes on my dream, and I wake up. It is a
      sound different from the ceaseless pattering of the rain on the roof,
      which has faded into the spectrum of ignorable background noise. I open my
      eyes, banishing the dream from my vision. Here, in the single concrete
      pathway cutting right down the middle of the brush, I lie with hands
      bound, abandoned. Little has changed since the last time I drifted back
      into waking, though the weakness in my body has noticeably dimmed. I
      notice that, with a bit of effort, I can already move my legs, though my
      arms are still numb and useless. It is a familiar feeling. I woke up from
      the coma like this. This time, however, my imitator and biggest fan stands
      above me. Leo Shirazumi. With my sight slowly coming back, I see him
      staring down at me with half a smirk plastered on his face. A mean smile
      meant for me. “You’ve awoken faster than I’d expected, my lady death,” he
      says as he moves to take a knee beside me. In one hand, he holds a filled
      syringe at the ready. “The drugs have had worse efficacy on you, looks
      like. I knew I should have used this first.” He grabs one of my bound arms
      and forcefully sticks the needle in a vein. The numbness makes me feel no
      pain. My entire body is slack and unresponsive, like a broken machine. All
      I can do now is to glower at the man. “That look in your eyes is perfect,”
      he says with audible delight. “You should always keep it that way. Relax,
      all I’ve given you is a muscle relaxant. You need it to stay calm and
      still for what comes next. I want you to stay quiet.” He sits on the
      concrete path now, and his eyes run up and down my body, taking all of it
      in. Our eyes meet, and, disgusted, I turn away from him, choosing to look
      instead at the rain outside the windows. “Oh, how long have these three
      years been? How long since I was this close to you? I wish you could feel
      how good I feel now, with all my waiting finally paying off.” In his voice
      is an affection that I don’t feel the need to deign with a response,
      though I let him play out his soliloquy as he wills. “Alaya made it clear
      to me what a failure I was. Said I was too ‘unlike’ you, whatever that
      meant. Can you believe that? How can we be unlike each other? Huh, Ryōgi?
      When we killers are birds of a feather. You know both you and I don’t
      belong to their world. Broken people like us should get together, become
      closer.” I don’t answer him. My mind is preoccupied with thoughts of
      someone else, someone surely far away from here. Yet the man persists with
      his worthless spiel. “Ever since your accident, I’ve been watching over
      you. Seeing who has come into your life. The other two who Alaya
      manipulated to shape you into what you are worried me a bit, but I could
      not get in the way. Alaya ensured I wouldn’t. He used people, like tools.
      Isn’t that sick? Isn’t that fucked up? But how could I fight him? I stayed
      away from you, as he’d commanded. So please, don’t be so mad at me. It
      wasn’t my fault. But I never forgot you. Your memory was always sweet. And
      when Alaya was finally destroyed, I knew that like you, I was free from
      his influence. I knew I was the only one that could do anything for you.
      Ah, yes, how I’ve waited for the day I could to talk to you as I am now.”
      He leans in toward me, so close I can smell his breath stinking of smoke
      and weed, so close that he has to get on his hands and knees and linger
      above me, his face leering above mine. Then suddenly, he draws back, takes
      one of my legs, and puts his lips on the shin in a tender kiss. He makes a
      disgustingly viscous sound, accompanied by a wet sensation. His tongue
      races roughly from the shin, going slowly upward, trembling as it makes
      contact with skin. I keep my silence, letting the only thing that echoes
      in the dull warehouse be his own furious breathing, going faster with each
      beat. My body doesn’t do what I tell it to, yet my sensation is as keen as
      before. I can feel the sweat pouring from my brow, and gathering at my
      back, and over my chest, as if at the height of summer. He takes the hem
      of my kimono in his mouth and tears it away with one swift motion, as a
      dog would. Leo Shirazumi’s breathes his warm breath to my skin, consumed
      by his act. His tongue, at the knee now, flows over with saliva as it
      continues to trace itself upwards. Now he clings to the inner thigh, the
      glutinous noise still not abating. The spit coils about my skin. And
      still, as much as I want to speak, to say anything, to shout, I kill my
      voice. Finally, he reaches the waist. He seems not to notice or care about
      the kimono covering me, and his mouth continues to go up, licking the
      cloth. There is no end to his salivating, and even clothed, I can feel its
      wetness seeping through. The handcuffs feel tight and painful now. The
      beast’s tongue climbs, traces the outline of my breasts, taking each
      nipple in his mouth for only a moment before continuing to my neck, then
      to my cheek, and finally to my eye, forming one dull line. Now his face is
      above me again, his steaming breath hitting my face full on. The stink of
      him, and the stench that he shared on my body, is almost enough to make me
      throw up. “Bastard,” I finally say, the only word I spare him. The smile
      it puts on his face is one of self-satisfaction. Now he descends his head
      again, this time opening his mouth and biting deeply into my jugular. The
      teeth dig in, the pain furious and keen, more so than any regular bite. I
      let slip a sharp intake of breath because of the pain; like a blade
      slipping slowly into my brain. The sound is the only satisfaction I give
      him. And as suddenly as he began, it ends with him withdrawing himself
      from me, leaving the mark of the beast on my neck. I can feel the blood
      slowly seeping out from my neck, tracing a lazy trail as it dribbles
      slowly from the open wound. “No. I can’t…eat just yet. You haven’t come
      back yet. You haven’t returned to what you were.” He whispers this as he
      stands back up. “I love you so much, that you’ll get extra special
      treatment from me. Consumption is my origin, and when it is unleashed, I
      need to eat indiscriminately. Preferably people, eh? But the one that
      stands before you is the Leo Shirazumi that the impulse supposedly
      conquered. I can’t lose to such a simple thing. As long as you’re here, I
      can slip through, yes.” As if to prove his point, he stands up and
      distances himself from me. “Again, you refused to kill me last night! You
      haven’t committed one proper human murder yet. Alaya was no human, more a
      conviction given form. But you’re more of a monster than I am, yet why is
      there no murder in your past?!” His breathing has become even more rasping
      than just a minute before. Angrily, he turns back toward me. “It’s a
      problem that we need to fix. If I don’t have someone just like me, I can’t
      have peace. I’ll always be like this! It’s you…it’s you that I need. I
      thought you’d be like me, but you betray me! If I can’t have you, the
      impulse will take over me!” He begins to shout toward the end, and it is
      hard to distinguish the rage from the desperation. With an unsteady gait,
      the beast known as Leo Shirazumi walks away from me, retreating a bit
      deeper into the brush. “Wait for me, alright? I can take care of the one
      holding your leash back.” Then he slinks back further and further into
      darkness, until finally, I can no longer see him. Though I know well
      enough what he means, and though I know what he plans to do, I cannot
      focus my mind. Is it the drugs? All I can think of is vague recollections,
      and incoherent scraps of memory that drift in and out of dream. The number
      of raindrops falling on the window, and what tomorrow might bring.
      Meaningless things. I need to focus. Why did I seek out the murderer in
      the first place? There were many reasons, but the most important one
      eludes me. I was…it was me that wanted to settle it once and for all. The
      return of the murders, and the shattered memories of what happened four
      years ago, recently returned to me…and my fear of reclaiming the urge to
      kill him, just like on that rain-soaked night. All of it is connected. And
      in plunging through my addled mind, I remember. If there really were
      monsters in this world, I want to believe—I have to believe—that I’m not
      one of them. I can feel it, the wetness welling up in my eyes. I want to
      go back. Back to the fragile life I lived with him this past half year
      since I awoke. I want to prove to someone that I can be normal. That’s why
      I sought out the murderer. To finish it all. But I lost sight of it. I
      took my sleep in the forgotten corners of the city, hunting down the
      murderer, and through it all, validated the murderer that still lurked
      inside of me. My persistence in pursuing him made me sloppy, and led me
      here to be ambushed and trapped. If it had been the old me— the three
      years ago—then this would never have happened. I’ve become weak, even
      allowed Leo Shirazumi, a disgusting mad dog, to violate me. If there was
      ever a bigger proof for foolishness, none exist better than myself.
      Inexcusable and unforgivable. I want to go back to Mikiya, face his stupid
      smile, and say my complaints in front of him. It isn’t my fault. All of
      this is because of him. I turned into this because of him. All my weakness
      stems from him alone. I wouldn’t have been like this if it wasn’t for him.
      And now, even living without him seems impossible. “This is all so
      stupid.” The drugs still take their toll on my consciousness, but less so
      now. I still feel hot, chokingly so, and I can feel my perspiration
      getting worse, as if my body is about to melt. No one can see me like
      this. Which is why I have to go. I can’t stay chained here forever. This
      isn’t where I want to be. I have to go back. Back home. To the only place
      where I ever felt at home. Strangely enough, the image my mind conjures is
      not that of the old Ryōgi estate, but the mundane yet familiar apartment
      where Mikiya Kokutō would always be waiting.
