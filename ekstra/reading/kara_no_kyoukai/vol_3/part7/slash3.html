    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - /3</h1>
    <p>
      - August. - - Every day, my brain continues to give ground to insanity. -
      I know…there’s good in you. I remember, and it lends my feet to stop. When
      I find that the only sentiment the words dredge up from me is a strong
      irritation, it only makes me more annoyed. “Optimism must be in his
      blood,” I conclude, grinding my teeth as I imagine what kind of stupid
      face he must have had as he was saying that. I try to make the image
      vanish. He really hasn’t changed in four years, that guy. Still clinging
      to a misplaced belief in a murderer, still trying to smile at me as if all
      of it were nothing. Giving me a taste of normalcy, a promise of some
      attainable dream, all of it a foolish fantasy. A fantasy of someone
      abnormal like me living and having her place under the sun. always used to
      hate that, and now I understand why. The past always comes back to square
      with you. I tried to kill him once before, and I don’t know if I can stop
      myself from doing that again. So that’s why I need to be far from him now,
      so I don’t question myself, and so I can be far from whatever pain his
      presence just engenders. But all it results in is me being the old me
      again, someone who thinks of Mikiya as an unwelcome hindrance. I can’t say
      for certain if that’s what I truly believe in. Two hours after my chat
      with Mikiya, I finally get to where Leo Shirazumi likely made his final
      retreat. I’d tracked the place down well before I called Mikiya up. It was
      fairly simple to follow Shirazumi’s trail. Blood, the smell of weed, and
      some questions to a few street level dealers who I left only a little
      intimidated and worse for wear all soon pointed me in the right direction.
      Now, I’m back here again, eager to settle the score once and for all. The
      harbor is dead at night, the steel cargo containers stacked together
      forming impromptu structures that make the entire place feel like it’s a
      town that was raised overnight. Somewhere in here is the last redoubt of
      that murderous monster. Eventually I reach the part of the harbor that’s
      quartered for storage and warehousing, and at that point, it is already
      well past 9pm. Few people live here in this part of town, and even fewer
      have any reason or desire to go here. The only lonely company here is the
      blackened sea, and high lamps shining little pools of light on the streets
      and walkways below. Perfect, then. This means there’s very little chance
      of anything or anyone getting in the way. At last, I reach my objective: a
      fairly sizable warehouse near the Broad Bridge. I grip my knife in my left
      hand, and my right is hidden inside my jacket pocket, fingers holding a
      smaller throwing knife. Checking myself, I walk toward the building. It
      looks big enough to rival a school gymnasium. The walls go up to about
      eight meters, and has windows going round it at regular intervals around
      the seven meter mark, and I suspect some larger windows in the roof as
      well. Much like a greenhouse, it must be terribly bright in there during
      daytime. From afar, I thought that I’d have to try for the windows somehow
      to gain entry, but as I neared the place, I realized I don’t have to. The
      steel door of the front entrance itself is slightly ajar, the handle long
      overtaken by rust. Yeah, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a trap. I
      briefly consider trying to go around, but I remember Mikiya. Kill
      Shirazumi, and there’s no going back. I wonder what he meant by that. Fuck
      it. The faster I can kill Shirazumi, the faster I can get these doubts out
      of my head. If going in the front means it draws Shirazumi out faster,
      then so be it. I open the door wider, and take a step inside, exiting the
      dreariness of the port, to enter something far stranger. Skylights are
      indeed placed on the roof, which along with the side windows, prove to be
      the only place where moonlight manages to seep through. The light reveals
      exactly what this warehouse’s purpose is. A few meters from the entrance,
      thick foliage is planted in the open soil. The plant’s reach close to knee
      height, all of them the exact same breed. Cutting straight through the
      middle of it all is a concrete path. This is it. This is the garden he
      uses. A rustling in the brush catches my attention, over where no patch of
      light shines to reveal his position. I’m not alone here. He’s watching me,
      determining what his next move will be. I suddenly realize how vulnerable
      I am in here. Why the hell did I even step into such an obvious ambush
      where he has the advantage? Mikiya, and his stupid words. Is he throwing
      me off my game that much? At that moment, the thick foliage rustles
      loudly, and I see some shape in the darkness parting the plants as it
      runs, close enough to me now that it startles me. He closes the last few
      meters with vigorous steps, emerging from the shadows leaping with knife
      held high to make a vicious overhead slice. Smart move, but he revealed
      himself a moment too soon. My left hand moves, meeting his blade with a
      parry from my own. The blow is warded, but it was so strong that my arm
      falters for just a moment. Any experienced in-fighter would spot that and
      press his advantage to hammer home, but Shirazumi is clearly not so
      experienced. He uses that momentary lapse of my guard to make good his
      escape, jumping high and away from me. Just like last night, he makes an
      inhumanly high and long leap toward the wall. Of course, not being a bird
      or a spider, I clearly can’t follow him like that. But I’ve come prepared
      for that move. As soon as he jumps, I quickly take an educated prediction
      at where he’ll land. And before he even lands, the throwing knife hidden
      inside my pocket is sent flying by my right hand to intercept its target.
      A second and a half later, and I see it scored a hit, enough to elicit a
      painful grunt from him as he falls to the floor. I was already sprinting
      as fast as I can toward him as soon as I threw the knife, and when he
      fell, I banked on the fall and the knife hurting him enough to be
      disoriented and confused. The gamble worked, and it gives me the extra few
      seconds I need to rush up to him and pin him down to the ground by
      straddling him. Now he looks up at me, his face a mixture of confusion,
      anger, and surprise. Surprise at how quickly I adapted from last night’s
      little indecisive dance, maybe? Whatever the case, I savor the look on his
      face, and how he’s lost for words. This boy who looks so much like me is
      silent as my left hand raises the knife. A boy. That’s just what he is. A
      little boy, so powerless, so scared. “W…wait a minute,” he pleads. But
      prey do not get the privilege of begging for a reprieve. I stab my knife
      downwards…much as I had wielded a similar one, but against a different
      boy, in some other rain-soaked night. “What?” says a voice, choking on its
      own surprise. It is the prey’s voice, as well as my own, both startled at
      what just happened. The knife closed to his throat, and I stopped it right
      before it pierced flesh and gave him the red smile. I put my strength in
      my left hand. No escape will avail both of us now. The boy cannot escape
      my blade…and I cannot escape wearing the boy’s skin, becoming the
      murderer. And in so doing, I will be alone again, with nothing to call a
      home, nothing to hurt or pain me, living freely; a daughter of chaos. Yet,
      why does my left hand not move? Why can’t I kill Leo Shirazumi? There’s no
      going back. The words echo in my mind. The prey has more than enough time
      to exploit that moment. He pushes me away, trying to slip away from my
      grasp. He rises, trying to escape, but in so doing, he reveals his back to
      me, defenseless. He wouldn’t know. My Eyes and their Art weave the lines
      of death into sight, and I see them tracing out and around his body. All
      that is left is to swing the knife. There’s no going back. And just like
      that, my last chance slipped from my grasp. And it was me who let it slip,
      willingly. What a farce. A great farce. I had the chance for the sweet
      taste of murder I had craved after for so long, but I couldn’t cross that
      last empty boundary. All because of such simple words. “Fuck!” I shout
      reflexively. I never asked for a way back into his world. I never asked
      for this world’s forgiveness. But why? “This is all…because of him,” I
      whisper under my breath, each sound a pained and angered breath. Now the
      prey I had let slip begins to laugh. The prey who had only seconds ago
      feared the predator in front of him has seen his enemy for what she really
      is. Broken. And now he returns to the skin he donned last night, the mask
      of the murderous monster. And I cannot kill him, cannot stop him, cannot
      even bring myself to run.
