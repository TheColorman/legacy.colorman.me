    <p>
      - But killing by itself does not quiet the voices. - - Being all alone
      only makes them louder and louder. - - I need someone just like me.
      Someone as broken. - February 11, Thursday. I’d been thinking long and
      hard on what Shirazumi said to me, and in light of what he revealed about
      his condition, I’ve decided to finally talk to Miss Tōko about this. So
      far I’d tried to keep her out of what was essentially a personal matter,
      but if what Shirazumi told me was true, then he’s somehow being influenced
      by a spell woven from the Art. As soon as I heard him speak that word, I
      knew that it would be prudent to consult the only (decent) mage I know. So
      under a torrential rain that has poured since the early awn hours, I drive
      over to Miss Tōko’s office, ultimately just a stop before I go back to the
      harbor to see if I can find something more. It takes longer than I can
      believe to tell it all to Miss Tōko, about all that I’d found about the
      drugs, and especially about Leo Shirazumi, and when I finish, she only
      hums to herself as she lights up yet another cigarette. After waiting long
      enough for a reply that I thought was forthcoming, I speak. “Something
      wrong, Miss Tōko?” She looks at me with a disaffected, morose stare, and
      then takes off her glasses. “No, nothing wrong at all. Just thinking how
      best to tell you that there’s really no way to treat your friend. Oh hey,
      there you go. If it’s been four years since his origin was awakened, then
      he’s…well, he’s not your friend anymore.” Smoke trails up from the
      cigarette she set down on the ashtray. She leans her cheek on one hand
      propped up on her table, and lets her gaze drift upwards, as if she were
      deep in reverie. “Still, one of the awakened, huh? A dull parting gift,
      even for Alaya. Weak willed as your friend seems to be, he wouldn’t have
      stood a chance against the power of that Art. His degeneration was
      inevitable.” “Can you explain to me what this ‘origin,’ actually is?
      Shirazumi said it was like some kind of instinct that overrides your own
      will, or something like that.” “Partly right, but not the whole picture,”
      she says, transferring her cigarette to her left hand so she can
      gesticulate with her customary right. “If you think living for twenty
      years is enough for you to assert that you are yourself, and that you are
      in control of your body, think again. Your will is as malleable as any
      aspect of reality the Art can manipulate. Character rules your mind, and
      it is the flesh that expresses that outwardly. New Age solipsism turned
      out to be truer than anyone thought, I suppose.” She puts her free hand on
      her chin, before asking me a strange question. “Do you believe in past
      lives, Kokutō?” “I don’t have a say either way, really. I’m not affirming
      it, but I’m not categorically denying it either.” “Spoken like a true
      politician, I swear. Cyclicality and repetition. You see it everywhere,
      from occult lore to scientific theories. Spirits, souls, and life. Outside
      of all these concepts, there is the origin, reincarnated into something
      else, eternally. And from that chaos is born a certain order. Certainly,
      it is said that mages also make use of this manifestation of age-old
      power, making all of us lean towards some aspect of personality. A
      purifying cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Follow the origin to
      hundreds of spiraling lives lived, until you reach the primordial origin
      of the soul. “The Collegium teaches us that there is a place and time
      where existence first came to be. But in eternal paradox, there is no life
      there. Only the impetus for creation. An overriding direction, an entropic
      tendency to chaos that drives all of reality. Such shards of creation
      obtain a purpose, a task, placing themselves into things part of the
      Pattern of reality that matches its symbology. An animal perhaps. Or a
      plant. Sometimes, or eventually, it may be a man, finding his soul.
      Sometimes, these purposes can feel like an imperative. “This chaotic
      impulse is what mages call the origin. Is it instinct? The Greek ‘daemon?’
      Ancestral recall? Moments of genius? The voice of God or the devil? Ask
      five mages, you will get ten different answers. But whatever it is, it is
      burned into your soul, and it would be folly to turn away from it.” She
      smiles then, as if what she had just been saying had not been in any way
      peculiar. Yet I understood her well enough, surprisingly. “For the vast
      majority of people, though, they are never aware of it. It is just there,
      close but never near enough to be important. It differs for each person.
      Shiki, whose origin is emptiness, is compelled quite strongly. But Azaka,
      whose origin is the taboo, is still quite normal. But to those awakened to
      it, well—it’s a whole different ball game.” She looks at me with narrowed,
      razor eyes. Even I know what she means. “So by being awakened to it, you
      give in to that impulse completely?” I venture. “Yes. Little by little.
      Leo Shirazumi has fought it every step of the way. But in the end he has
      little choice except to give in to it. ‘Consumption’ is a pretty unique
      one as far as origins go, though. I can see why Alaya kept his eyes on
      him. Look, Kokutō. If Leo has an origin of consumption, then predatory
      lineages must have been his origin’s legacy. When you’re awakened to your
      origin, the weight of all your previous lives becomes too hard to bear.
      Leo Shirazumi is more beast than man now. While his humanity as Leo
      Shirazumi still remains, the beast scratches away at that, until it is
      finally gone. Fairly interesting development, I’d say,” she says coldly,
      appending a laugh to her final comment. While she always wields a grim
      humor, I can’t ignore her last sentence. “Is all this business with the
      Art just a game to you people? It’s all that mage’s fault, isn’t it? The
      one he met. Shirazumi couldn’t have brought this on himself.” “Really,
      now?” she remarks, her voice acquiring its signature menace. “The spell to
      awaken the origin cannot be woven with the mage alone. It is the one to be
      awakened who first feels the stirrings of his soul begin to call out to
      him. Then there is the bargain in the form of a spell, predicated on the
      consent of the one to be awakened. Which means Leo Shirazumi always had a
      choice. His transformation into a beast is of his own volition, as are his
      murders. He wanted this. The life he cast away can never return to him, no
      matter how much he wants. It’s too late for him. This is the true face of
      the man you knew, and more fool you if you think I lie. His last words to
      you were the death throes of a damned man trying to eke out that last bit
      of sympathy from you.” They say that any good instructor has a stern and
      firm voice. That is the sound of Miss Tōko’s voice now, a tone I have not
      heard her adopt ever since that incident in November, and she has never
      spoken or looked more serious. And because of that, I know for a fact that
      she isn’t kidding. She looks at me with a frown, perhaps expecting me to
      press the point and being disappointed that I haven’t yet provided her
      with the verbal ammunition to chew me out. All that’s left is an empty
      helplessness. “Is there nothing you can do for him, then?” “The spell that
      binds him is the final, great attainment of the mage who used the medium
      of souls to chase after ascension. It would be a mercy to grant him peace,
      but there’s little you can do to stop him. It’s a miracle for Leo
      Shirazumi to even hold out as long as he’s had. Tomorrow, he’ll be
      different, a beast that abdicated his humanity.” I want to cry out at the
      futility of it all. He asked me to save him. Why would he do that if he
      knew that he couldn’t be saved? Was it the truth, or was it, like Miss
      Tōko says, just a ploy for something more sinister? “Oh, man. You’re an
      easy book to read, Kokutō. Well, I can’t very well stop you on your little
      quest, but you’re up against a monster. Leaving him to Shiki would be the
      wise option. She’s hunting him to finally close the book on what happened
      four years ago, right?” Settling matters, huh? That’s part of it, for
      sure, but it’s definitely not the whole story. I couldn’t help thinking in
      our conversation last night that I heard the same strained voice from her
      in that night when I almost lost her. When she almost made the choice of
      murder. What could prompt her to be so inclined towards killing? “Miss
      Tōko, why does someone ever kill someone else?” I ask, hoping for a reply
      that is not so reproachful. Miss Tōko leans back comfortably in her office
      chair, and says her answer without an ounce of reflection. “It’s emotional
      release. When you kill, that’s an outward expression of how you feel.
      People can only hold in so much. Whether it’s love or hate, when you’re
      filled with emotion, it has to get out somehow. It’s how we deal. Those
      who hate try to forget it, or try to separate themselves from what they
      dislike. The extremes of hate go towards murder. And because they see it
      as self-preservation, what moral code they cling to temporarily
      disappears, becoming unimportant.” “But there are people that commit
      murder even without that reason,” I put in. “That’s massacre, not murder.
      When one looks both on his past and his human dignity, weighs them, and
      throws one away; that is murder. That way a man pays the price, and
      carries the weight of the sin of murder. But a massacre is different. The
      victim might have been human, but the killer lacks the common dignity of
      man, and is thus no longer human. The sin does not weigh heavily on such
      killers.” I remember the diary, and what was written in it. To murder
      someone means you murder yourself too. “The news always talks about this
      murderous monster. What do they actually mean when they say that?”
      “Exactly what it says on the tin. A monster that no longer cares, carving
      their place in the world until they fade like a natural disaster. People
      dragged into its influence are the poor, unlucky souls.” Miss Tōko’s
      answer startles me. I can swear I’ve heard Shiki say the same thing once.
      Yes, right before she disappeared, ten nights before this. We saw the
      news, and she said to me that you couldn’t really call what the suspect
      did a murder. How she said that a lifetime only has room for one real
      murder. “That’s it…now I remember…” I mutter in a low voice. Yes. Miss
      Tōko and Shiki are saying the same thing. Shiki told me the words once,
      and how they were the last words her grandfather left her. Family words
      that have guided her entire life. But now, she’s about to stray. Me and
      the murderous monster have been led to the same realization by Shiki,
      unwitting or no. I don’t presume to know what Shiki feels about me, but
      something about it pains her, and leads her to lash out and kill.
      Something inside her is giving way to feelings that I’d thought she’d long
      parted with, and now she thinks that killing someone can save her. Her
      impulse of murder is winning again. Shirazumi thinks the same way. But he
      thinks he’ll benefit from Shiki’s loss of control. Perhaps he thinks, deep
      inside him, that he would have finally found a friend, the same as him.
      Someone just as broken, the diary had said. “Sorry to have bothered you
      like this, ma’am,” I say abruptly as I rise from my chair. Miss Tōko
      frowns, but it’s the kind of frown where she seems to already know what
      exactly I was going to do. “Oh, we’re done are we? It’s raining cats and
      dogs outside, Kokutō. Think it’d be a good idea for you to stay in for a
      while?” “I’m sorry, ma’am. I realized I have to go.” I make sure to bow
      before I walk out the door. Before the door to the office closes behind
      me, I hear Miss Tōko say, “Be good on yourself out there, Kokutō. And I’ll
      see you tomorrow.”
