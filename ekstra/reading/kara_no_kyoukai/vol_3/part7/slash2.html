    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - /2</h1>
    <p>
      - June. - - My life now has never been closer to perfect. - - To find out
      that having a conversation with somebody, without fear or restraint, has
      been very liberating. - - Perhaps it would be at recess, or lunch, or even
      after school. - - I would wait for him with a clinging anticipation. - -
      And the times when we talk are times when my heart beats so fast, it
      begins to hurt. - - But it is pain that can be ignored, so long as we can
      talk, and let it never end. Though it always must. - - Ah, I see it now. -
      - My world has been cloven in two. - - And the boundary between these two
      worlds relies on that singular truth, the man named Mikiya Kokutō. - When
      I finally wake up, the sun had long since set in the west. I pull myself
      up, and make my way to the edge of the roof I had just slept on, and jump
      nimbly to the neighboring roof of a long abandoned low-rise. The roof that
      had so kindly served as a bed to me was only authorized personnel allowed,
      you see. That pretty much made it the closest thing I had to a perfect
      place to sleep in without being bothered. So I got to the roof of the
      abandoned low-rise next to it, and it was an easy jump from there to the
      next roof and freedom of sleep. More than a week now since I started this
      ridiculous life. Unlike the other building, which had decidedly less
      external vertical access, this building had a ladder from roof to sidewalk
      level. Looking down before I use it to make sure the coast is clear, I
      quickly descend the ladder and find myself back in a familiar alley. A
      silence engulfs the city at this hour, as it begins to get truly dark.
      Something dangerous is out. I can feel it in my bones. I keep myself at
      the ready. Only scattered trash and paper decorate the lonely alley I
      stand in. Conveniently, one of these is a discarded newspaper, dated
      February 9, today. As for the front page headline, it comes as little
      surprise. The murderous monster again. “Murderous monster kills four
      people. A kimono-clad figure…spotted in crime scenes?” I read out to
      myself. Huh. That’s an eyebrow raiser. Four people? Do they mean the four
      guys from last night? And this paper’s saying they’re dead. Kimono…do they
      mean me? It really did get hairy last night, and the whole affair was over
      really fast. But I couldn’t have killed them. I couldn’t. God, I don’t
      even know anymore. All I know now is I need to find him. This murderous
      monster whose identity I don’t even have a fucking clue on. Like three
      years ago, I find myself drawn to the places where this killer has done
      his work, to think on them and see if I can find something in myself. I
      throw the newspaper away, maybe a bit more strongly than I’d intended. “I
      don’t know anymore,” I repeat, whispering it to myself. The wind howls,
      and for a moment, it scatters the trash about. With people out for me,
      now, more than ever, I need to move so that no one sees me. Now, more than
      ever, the backalleys will be my passage. Now, more than ever, I need to
      hide myself in the dark, dirty places. Now, more than ever, I need to cast
      aside humanity, at least for a while. And even then it may be painful,
      painstaking, yet ultimately fruitless work. That I still don’t stop what
      I’m doing even though I know this, might be the clearest proof of my
      idiocy. Every day there are no easy or fulfilling meals, no rest for my
      muscles, and no satisfaction to my sleep. I don’t have anywhere else left
      to go, but it still feels like I’m running from something, deep in the
      vast darkness of the city. I think to myself, what the hell have you
      started here, Shiki? Holding my breath, hunting someone? After I’ve found
      the murderer, what then? Kill him? Is that what I’m really after?
      Mikiya…he wouldn’t like that. Just remembering him makes me feel more like
      I’m falling into a trap that I can’t pull myself out of. I shake my head,
      trying to dispel all the troubling thoughts. It doesn’t work, but at least
      I remember to walk now. Once more into the breach tonight, I suppose. I
      need to end this fast. End it, and maybe I can go home… At two in the
      morning, the entire city sleeps the sleep of the dead. Not a single human
      shadow in the roads, and the noise of cars are infrequent and always at
      some place far away, a few streets over. And always, the police siren
      clung to them, like the neighing of distant horses. Businesses are closed,
      and houses have their lights off, and dark clouds cover the moonlight and
      the accompanying twinkling of the stars, preventing any respite from the
      gloom. You’d think that with nobody out, that nothing would happen, that
      all would be well. Ah, but there’s the rub. For there are people out, only
      hidden in the forgotten places of the city, in the thieves’ highways and
      in the gutters and in the shadow of looming overpasses and buildings. With
      any luck, they huddle together for warmth and comfort. But the ones who
      ply the night alone aren’t so lucky. I walk the main street, which looks
      so strange and alien tonight having been deserted. A fair distance away, I
      see a person, the streetlight behind him granting me only a silhouette to
      work with. I stop. Something seems off about him. There is a droop in his
      stance that hides something about him. Something about all this feels
      so…nostalgic. The shadow sees me, and slips inside a nearby alley. My feet
      spring to life without my will, following the shadow. A chill rises in my
      throat, but I ignore it, and enter the alleyway. Inside the alley, it’s
      like an entirely different world. The alley is a cul-de-sac, with the
      buildings forming walls all around it. Because of this, no sunlight shone
      upon it even on bright afternoons. Honestly, it looked more like a room
      than an alley, another place forgotten by the city. In this dead space,
      there was once one homeless person who dreamed his dreams of happiness and
      delusion, but not today. The walls of this alley just got a brand new
      paint job. There is a wet, sticky quality to the ground, and the usual
      smell of rotten food is commingled with an even stronger scent. All around
      me is a sea of blood. Bodily fluids seep and flow through the alley, and
      the sweet, sticky smell pierces my nostrils. In the center of it all is
      the corpse. Whatever face he donned in death can’t be seen anymore. His
      arms were severed, and the legs became stumps around the knee area,
      pressurized blood pouring out of them. Where the other ends of his arms
      and legs are, I cannot locate. The stumps themselves don’t even look like
      they’ve been cut. It isn’t the work of some fine blade, but more like the
      violent feeding of an animal. From someplace, I hear—or do I imagine
      it?—the sound of a hungry stomach being satisfied, and the noise of
      chewing, barely even an echo. It is the sound of tough meat being chewed
      on. A world so different, even the bold crimson of blood was being
      overwhelmed by the raw smell of beastly warmth. And behind the body, the
      shadows seem to part to admit another man. A man whose contours and curves
      snake around him with. He wears a similarly blood red jacket, and held
      loosely in his lazily hanging right hand is a knife, around seven inches
      long. The hair that almost reaches his shoulders is cut without a care,
      but long enough that you would wonder at the man’s gender. At a distance,
      he would have probably passed as a girl. Only one thing differentiates me
      and him: his hair, a golden and noble blonde. The putrid air that washes
      over and sways that distinctive feature of hair lends him a carnivorous
      aura. A leonine character that presses deep down into the soul. *** This
      was all much too familiar to Shiki. All of this was much too close to a
      long, dearly departed memory, now come again to repeat itself like a
      curse. It was a memory of summer’s end, four years ago. A dead night much
      like tonight closed upon the town, and on that night, Shiki saw a shadow,
      followed it…and the next thing she knew, she stood, still as anything,
      before a blood-soaked corpse. What happened in between was not her own
      recollection, but of the other, Shiki. “Who the hell are you?” said Shiki,
      talking to the individual before her that seemed like it stepped out of
      some image in her own mind. Shiki saw this “other” her, this blonde Shiki,
      move its shoulders. A quiver, a tremble. Not out of fear, she imagined,
      but out of a perverse pleasure. “Shiki…Ryōgi,” the shadow said. Shiki
      wondered if that was a reply, or a beckoning to her. The voice that said
      it was so plain that it could not be read. With a flutter of golden hair,
      the shadow turned to her. And she saw now that even the face bore the
      twisted resemblance, like looking intensely into a queerly discolored
      mirror. The blonde Shiki had red eyes, no less penetrating than Shiki’s
      own, and the ears glinted with silver earrings. Though not a kimono, Shiki
      saw that the shadow wore a black skirt, reaching down to just above the
      ankle; a match for the deep, blood-red leather jacket. But the shadow was
      no woman. Just a man, given the title of a murderous monster. “It’s you.
      You’re—” whispered Shiki, but before she could finish, the murderer had
      already started to make a beeline right for her. Knife in hand, he moved
      low like a sprinter, with no other choice in this narrow alley but to try
      and break past Shiki. Shiki quickly drew her own blade with a practiced
      dexterity, but the scowl on her face then still told of her surprise. The
      shadow drew close, but with no human quality to its movement. He brought
      himself like a coiled snake, striking. And for a snake, even this narrow
      alleyway was more than enough to serve as a hunting ground. And even to
      Shiki’s trained eyes, the man moved much too fast for Shiki to reliably
      track. And as soon as the distance between them was nearing a close, his
      pattern of movement changed. With a potent force, his legs folded and he
      jumped, all of it happening so fast that it seemed like an explosion of
      strength. And suddenly he was in the air, knife held pointed, then thrust
      with frightening accuracy at Shiki’s head. A tiny glint in the darkness,
      and a moment later, the keening sound of steel upon steel. Another instant
      with a grating noise, as the murderer’s blade makes contact with Shiki’s
      own cross-guard. And in that instant, as both knives embraced each other
      like brothers, both combatant’s glances fell to each other’s eyes. Shiki,
      with narrowed eyes of hostility, and the murderer’s, with widened eyes
      replete with joy, and then the moment was quickly over. With a visible
      grin, the murderer disengaged himself, turning Shiki’s blade aside, and
      leapt to the side, behind Shiki and toward the other side of the alley,
      successfully going around her. Like a spider, he landed, having leapt six
      meters with one jump. And then he stopped, stood there, breathing with a
      beastly noise. And already, with his hunched form, and impossible
      movement, Shiki could clearly see that he had long been far removed from
      any common notion of humanity. “Why?” he spoke. “Why won’t you take it
      seriously?” Fresh blood from the corpse graced his fingertips and the hem
      of his skirt, still dripping as he spoke. Shiki felt little need to answer
      him, but still looks at this man that looks so much like her. “You’re not
      the same. Not the same woman four years ago. If you were the same, you
      would’ve killed me, but you keep toeing that boundary. I’ve wanted you for
      so long. You, so much like me. But why?” He spoke with a voice so guttural
      that it almost seemed like his very heart would come bursting forth from
      his mouth, and his breathing was loud and rasping. As if the very act of
      conversing was enough of a strain on his reasoning, and that his breathing
      would prove the death of him. Is it pleasure, Shiki thought, some kind of
      arousal, or was he truly in pain? Shiki decided that it didn’t truly
      matter. “I’d have never expected it to be you,” Shiki said, a hard, cold
      edge to her voice. “A woman’s name, and a body that could really be
      mistaken for a woman. We only talked once back at school, didn’t we?” The
      murderous monster shook his head in an unsteady rhythm. “Yes. So long ago.
      I’ve forgotten so much.” He snickered, barely suppressing his laugh. He
      was enjoying this, somehow. Shiki could find no joy to draw from here. She
      had sought this murderer out to finish all of this, and that was all. “How
      many have you killed?” she asks, her voice slight and almost hesitant. The
      murderer giggled now. “Would you believe me if I said I’ve already lost
      count? I try not to think on them. Just numbers. Just numbers, all of
      them. And no one can point them back at me, can they? I’m free of the
      cycle of crime and punishment. And so I kill, sometimes for days at a
      time, as you’ve obviously known.” He coughs violently, and seems to heave
      forward, but finds himself again before continuing. “I’ve left so many
      things, so many traces all for you. All the murders. How I left the
      corpses. I knew you’d think they were familiar. What happened four years
      ago. Yes,” he draws the word out in a long, low breath. “I thought that
      would jump start your memory. But you ignored me. Ignored all of it! It
      didn’t make the right…impression.” He flashes a smile, displaying a row of
      bloodied teeth that shine in the night. “They call me a monster. What I
      lacked in a name, people readily gave me. It’s spot on, no? This week was
      very good for me, too. I did exactly what they expected me to after giving
      me such a title. After all, people need me to commit murder, so that they
      can demonize him like any other monster they know. Right? But you know all
      this, don’t you, Ryōgi? You admired my work. You came looking for me. It’s
      the seed in you wanting to be free, to find a predator just like you. Just
      like me. Yeah, I understand. I understand. Because I know you best.” His
      labored breathing became higher and louder, echoing in the silence of
      night embracing the alleyway. Shiki saw him lick off the stray spots of
      blood still clinging to the corners of his mouth, his tongue savouring
      each drip. It did nothing about the blood still scattered on his face.
      What was he doing to that corpse that would cover him in blood from head
      to toe? His eyes were bloodshot like a madman’s. And in front of such a
      grisly sight, Shiki could muster no reply. The hate that welled up in her
      forbade any words, as though gracing the man’s presence with even a single
      word would dirty it irredeemably. Even if—or perhaps especially
      because—his words were hard to deny. Her desires, and her murderous
      impulse, coming together. Shiki turned away from him then, hiding her face
      and her furrowed brow. But the murderer didn’t miss a beat, as if he could
      himself sense the pump of blood, the telltale sign of minute perspiration
      that became the formula of trepidation. The man smiles, his mouth twisting
      into a crooked shape. “Oh, that won’t do. You keep holding back. You know
      what you’re doing. There’s something inside you, shouting out what you
      really are, but you deny it every day. But there was never any need to.
      Just submit. Do what it wants. It’s what you want, too.” Shiki keeps
      silent, still looking at the man as one would look at poison. The murderer
      voices his last proposition. “You’re a persistent bitch, I know. So I know
      that if you can’t return to what you once were, then I guess I just have
      to kill the cause of all this. Kill the one making you hold back. After
      which, everything would be solved. Go on. Tell me I can’t do it. You were
      so close to solving the problem yourself three years ago. So close. Now I
      just have to finish it myself.” The murderer threw his head back, eyes
      shut and laughing deeply. “Tell me—,” Shiki said menacingly. Her Eyes glow
      unlike before, blue and rich with the power of magic. She rushed toward
      the man, her movement so fast, and the man so distracted by his own
      revelry, that he never saw her. “—who’s going to kill who, now?” Shiki
      slashed effortlessly; her blade, empowered by entropy itself, passing
      through the man’s arm and laying waste. His knife bounced lazily on the
      ground, forgotten, and his distinctive laugh turned into a scream of mad
      keening on the edge of hearing. He leapt away from Shiki, trying to find
      safety in distance. But Shiki was fast, and gave pursuit. He needed to
      find someplace that Shiki couldn’t reach. So he jumped high, higher than
      what seemed possible, letting his remaining hand cling to a stray
      windowsill in one of the surrounding buildings. Unbelievably, he pushed
      himself up, leaping higher and higher, clinging to pipe fixtures and parts
      of the wall chipped away where his hands and feet could find purchase,
      moving with the ease of a flying squirrel. And at last when he had climbed
      about twenty meters up, clung to the side of the building with the
      sureness of a spider, he finally dares to look back down on the alley
      where he had just so narrowly escaped from. And down below, shining clear
      in the field of darkness, are the Arcane Eyes, an intense azure glow,
      unflinching and affixed as if they were the eyes of Death itself. *** The
      murderer had made his way away from that fateful alley, even though his
      blood thirst hounded him terribly inside. It did not matter. Another
      sensation hounded him more now. A virgin taste of genuine fear. And after
      it, strangely, jubilation that he could scarcely control. “I knew it.
      You’re still real,” he whispers under his breath as he skirts from rooftop
      to neighboring rooftop with a practiced effortlessness. “She was real.”
      Tonight, he knew, he had found the incontrovertible proof. That girl still
      prowled among the side of the world where the damned lived, the secret
      world of monsters and murderers that lay under everything. He would expose
      that side of her, bring it out like no one else truly could. He knew how.
      He needed only mention the notion of killing a certain someone to bring
      Shiki perilously close to that boundary. And if she had the sense to cross
      it, the man knew she would be a better monster than he had ever been.
      “It’s so simple. I just have to kill the one holding her leash.” He leapt
      down in a gap too wide to jump, but grabbed hold of a low-hanging wire
      fixture, and used it to maintain his momentum and swing himself across to
      the next wall, climbing it easily. Losing only seconds to climbing, he was
      easily back on the roof. Down below, Shiki tried to give chase, he knew.
      He could feel her, feel the drive of the hunt. But it was a hunt she had
      lost minutes ago. Swiftness was key, and running across these buildings
      was what made him swiftest of all. Though the low skyline of the
      neighborhood had no trees to swing from, it might as well have been a
      dense forest for the likes of him. He could hide himself, track his prey,
      all in convenience. It was an art. He felt alive more than ever now, even
      as the stump of his arm bled and left an obvious trail. Already, the blood
      had begun to clot, and the wounds began to close. Soon it would just be a
      mere stump. Near useless, but it didn’t matter. He offered a single,
      rejoicing, and defiant howl at the moonless night. A cry of love
      unfulfilled for four years, now finally reaching its fruition.
