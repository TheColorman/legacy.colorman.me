    <h1 class="title">The Second Homicide Inquiry - Prologue</h1>
    <p>
      1999, February 1. It’s the beginning of the last year of a millennium, and
      the tip of a new millennium’s inception. And as with most arbitrary shifts
      and divisions of temporal measurements, people start to cling to the words
      of prophets and doomsayers, whether out of personal profit or the osmotic
      and infectious effect of a panic in slow-boil. Wrapped as the city
      currently is in this nearly tangible layer of artificial menace, as well
      as a more easily perceived winter whose temperatures have reached levels
      atypical from the past few years, I, Mikiya Kokutō, have decided to spend
      this night walking together with Shiki. Winter is at its height, and these
      days, the sun is already well set after five in the afternoon, granting an
      early evening veil to the entire city. My breath is visible in white puffs
      before my mouth, and beside me Shiki is in the same state. The both of us
      are, I suppose, ever reliable (some would even say predictable) in how we
      dress. A dark-colored coat worn above a black turtleneck sweater paired
      with black slacks for me. While Shiki wears a blue kimono coupled with a
      red waist-length leather jacket, all the while having a pair of high
      combat boots donned. I’ve long since given up asking her if she’s ever
      cold in that attire. I’ve seen her in it ever since three years ago. The
      heat or the cold never seem to affect her as much as it does anyone else.
      Shiki offered to meet me on my way home after finishing work, which is not
      something she often does, and is an act I often associate with some
      ulterior motive on her part. “Alright, out with it. There’s something
      really important up if you can’t muster enough patience to wait for me
      back at your place. Taking the trouble to meet up with me so near the
      office is a pretty rare event.” “It’s nothing, really. It’s just been a
      little…dangerous lately, so I thought I’d see you home.” Her face is
      sullen as she casts her eyes about the surrounding area, never really
      looking at me. The wind blows a lonely breeze our way, and Shiki’s kimono
      flutters slightly. Shiki Ryōgi has always donned that style, ever since
      the day I first met her in high school. It always makes her look kind of
      strange, but I have to admit that it goes well with her height (around
      160cm). Her hair frames her face, and always looks to be haphazardly cut
      to terminate at collar height. Like her hair, her eyes are a threateningly
      deep black. As if to contrast all of this, though, she always speaks in a
      tone as rough as she likes, and almost without a thought for the next
      word. It always throws people for a loop the first time around. Now, she
      retains a posture more dignified and noble than beautiful, even as she
      walks and surveys the streets still partly awash in quickly retreating
      sunlight, as if she were a carnivore on some kind of hunt. I call her
      attention. “Shiki, you’ve been acting kind of funny lately.” “How funny
      can I be if you aren’t even laughing?” She says this lazily, lacking her
      usual spirit. Normally, she’d glance over at me just to enjoy my usual
      frown after her wit, but she keeps her eyes occupied elsewhere. Well, if
      she’s not in the mood to talk, then so be it. I keep pace alongside her,
      and proceed without another word. Shiki leads the both of us toward the
      direction of the train station near her house, which at this hour must
      still be packed. The way there, however, is as dead as midnight, with only
      me and Shiki walking along the narrow back streets. Without the lights on
      in the shops, and the street lamps, you’d think there was some kind of
      calamity. There’s a reason for it, though. I would guess it’s the same
      reason Shiki thinks she needs to walk me back home. Lone people who walk
      at night are being reported missing or turning up dead. Now, given the
      usually low crime rate in the area, this would have been shelved as
      something of a statistical anomaly. If it wasn’t so similar to the winter
      three years ago. In my first year in high school, there was a serial
      killer that put the city in a bit of a panic. He’d only appear in the
      night, and conduct violent ritual killings on people for no discernible
      reason. All in all, he killed seven people. Despite the numerous inquiries
      and cooperation with the media, the police’s desperate attempt to catch
      him failed, and a solid suspect never materialized. With no other murders
      fitting the pattern, it was assumed the serial killer had stopped, and the
      case was buried cold. The first murder started around summer four years
      ago, and the killer went to ground at around winter three years ago. I
      remember it being a cold February, with me and Shiki about to enter our
      second year. It was only afterwards that Shiki got into a car accident,
      and lapsed into a coma. As for me, I eventually graduated from high
      school, and moved on to college, but it only took a month for me to drop
      out, and soon after, I found employment with Miss Tōko. Shiki herself
      recovered from her coma only last year in summer. For me, the entire
      affair with the serial killer is a thing of the past. I imagine, however,
      that it isn’t the same for Shiki. To her, it would have only seemed to be
      half a year ago. The recent strings of killings fit the same gruesome
      pattern as four years ago, and the TV news has been playing it up as a
      return of the old culprit, with all the graphics and reenactments that
      come along with such a high profile story, almost as if the news networks
      were just lying in wait to spring the story fresh on their viewers again.
      Still, I can’t help but notice Shiki looking grimmer by the day the more
      she hears of it. I’ve only ever seen her like that once, three years ago,
      before the accident. When Ryōgi, still containing her other, masculine,
      Shiki personality, told me that she was a murderer. The train station is a
      taste of normalcy when we get there, as it is filled with all the usual
      number of people. Unlike the residential district we had just passed
      through, the station is brightly lit and packed with people going to and
      fro in a hurry, and the activity spills into the surrounding commercial
      district. Only one of few places in the neighborhood that you could count
      on the serial killer not making an appearance. Yet even here, the
      influence is felt. The way people draw closer together, as if to close
      ranks, and the touch, however slight, of fear on all their faces, guarded
      though they may be. The night’s just begun, and rush hour ensures a nearly
      endless stream of people. Passing the busy station and making our way
      through the commercial district, we pass an appliance store, the
      television on display showing the evening news. At a glance I already see
      what I expect: another feature story on the killer. While I quickly pay it
      no heed, Shiki is led to halt in front of it, her eyes affixed on the
      screen, so I reluctantly stop alongside her. “Mikiya, take a look at
      this,” Shiki says, with a chortle, “they’re calling him a murderous
      monster.” She’s right. In fairly large letters, bulleted by an X mark in
      the bottom of the TV, it says How the Murderous Monster Began. “I guess
      they thought just ‘killer’ wouldn’t make people nervous enough. A murder
      count exceeding ten is nothing to laugh at, I know, but don’t you think
      they’re being a bit sensationalist, though?” With an eyebrow raised, Shiki
      finally looks at me. “Well, yeah, that’s obvious. But I think they’re kind
      of right, though. If anyone right now deserved to be called a monster, it
      would be this guy. He wants the attention, the spectacle. He’s glad for
      it. Monsters rarely need a reason. The victims certainly never got one
      before they died. That’s why you can’t really call this a murder.” She
      returns her attention to the television, seeing the faint image of herself
      reflected on the glass surface of the screen. “What do you mean?” I ask.
      “Massacre and murder can be different. Maybe you’ve forgotten, Kokutō?
      That a lifetime only has room for one real murder.” She looks into my eyes
      then, as straight as she can manage. Normally, she looks quite detached,
      almost sleepy, as if she’s looking at something far away. But now there is
      an intensity in her black eyes, a pleading to some ancient memory. “One
      real murder…” I allow my voice to trail away. I definitely recall hearing
      something like that from her before, but when? And where? It was only long
      after this particular moment, when I can look back, and regret. Maybe if I
      remembered it, at that moment, all of what followed could have been
      avoided. “Never mind,” Shiki finally says after a few seconds. “It’s not
      important. Anyway, let’s get ourselves home. I just woke up, and if I
      don’t eat something I’m never gonna calm down.” “Wait, you just woke up?
      What happened to school? Did you forget that it’s a Monday today, or did
      you just decide to sleep over?” Her face breaks into a sly smile. “Calm,
      deep breaths,” she pleads mockingly. “I was at school this morning, c’mon.
      I meant my afternoon nap. Actually, I never told you, but my grades have
      been getting better since November, you know? C’mon, tell me you’re
      surprised.” I nod, genuinely taken aback. Her grades had been slipping as
      badly as her attendance rate, and I was worried she wouldn’t make it by
      year’s end. When I nod, she makes a self-satisfied sound, and puts her
      hands inside her coat pocket. “Right, then a reward’s in order, then!”
      declares Shiki out of the blue. “Azaka kept bragging to me about this
      fancy joint you took her to down in Akasaka. And whaddya know? I’ve
      actually always wanted to go and try it out. Oh, how I so wanted to kill
      her then.” The disturbing thing about Shiki saying that is knowing full
      well that she has a knife and has used it before. Before I can have a say
      in the matter, she grabs me by the arm and leads me away. I’m not entirely
      sure where she’s leading me just yet, but if her previous remark is any
      indication, it’s to Akazaka, where half of my paycheck will be no more
      than shattered hopes and dreams in the face of one night’s meal, and it
      doesn’t look like there’s any stopping her. Silently, I curse Azaka for
      telling Shiki about where I took her on New Year’s. Oh well, might as well
      enjoy this. After all, it feels like it’s been such a long time since we
      had a real date. In fact, the last time may well have been four years ago,
      back in high school, when she still had the boy Shiki inside her. She
      reminds me of him tonight actually, and I don’t think to question where
      this could have come from. Beyond the aloofness that she had earlier this
      afternoon, I didn’t see anything out of place. So we started February with
      an expensive dinner, and a night walking around town, just being together
      and enjoying ourselves like it was the last night we were allowed to do
      so.
