    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - /5</h1>
    <p>
      The rain is heavy, and the drops that slip through the thick cover of
      bamboo leaves land on my skin. A thousand frigid daggers burying into me.
      The first time I have ever really felt the cold. Some of the drops fall
      onto something metallic, and I notice that it is the blade of a knife that
      I hold in my hand. Cold rain to match equally cold steel. My cold,
      expressionless eyes are fixed on someone below me, though I do not know
      who— I wake up from a dream, a sensation of familiarity echoing inside my
      mind, but it is already retreating into a forgotten memory. Before I can
      process it further though, I open my eyes just a little bit only to catch
      sight of something small flying nearby. There is no mistaking it: it’s one
      of the fairies. The moment I open my eyes fully, I draw the knife from
      inside my pocket and throw it as hard as I can toward the fairy in flight.
      It takes only another instant to hear the dull sound of the knife
      impacting and clinging to the wall. Skewered through the knife is one of
      the fairies, an insect-winged creature just like Azaka’s vivid imagination
      of the things, making a small but high pitched keening sound. I think it’s
      trying to pull the knife out of itself with small hands, but it’s no use.
      With a last small noise, it disappears into the air in a trickle of
      momentarily bright material, only for that too to wink out of existence.
      “Fuck. I shouldn’t have killed it. Maybe it could’ve—” Maybe it could’ve
      what? Made the dream continue? Finally learn the truth about what happened
      three years ago? Remember the traffic accident that forced me to a coma?
      What of it then? “Stop thinking about that right now,” I tell myself as I
      quickly climb out of bed, readying myself to receive any more unwanted
      visitors. Just as I jump from the top bunk to the floor, I hear the
      distinct sound of the creak of the wood outside the door, and the sound of
      footsteps hurrying away. Someone’s been standing outside the door all this
      time! I put the knife back in my pocket and rush to open the door. The
      corridor stretches both east and west, and when I look east, I see only
      the shadow of a person running away, the height the only thing distinct
      about the figure. Misaya Ōji, maybe? Maybe she mistook me for Azaka? Hmph,
      fat chance of that. I know Azaka still insists on doing exactly as Tōko
      told her to, but if Misaya Ōji is conducting attacks on us in our room as
      we sleep, then there’s really no other choice for me. I pounce on after
      her, our steps making the hardwood floor groan, the sounds echoing in the
      corridor’s expanse. She’s faster than I expected, and I can’t close the
      distance between us. She knows where she’s going, too. She ducks out of
      the corridor, out the exit from the dormitories, and heads toward the
      direction of the main school building, using the covered path me and Azaka
      used the other day. The forest surrounds us for a minute or so of the
      chase, and the distance between us still remains far enough only for me to
      barely see her. Finally we emerge back into the school grounds. She
      doesn’t head to the school building like I expected though, but to the
      chapel. A trap. Nothing else to it. But it would be stupid to turn back
      now after I’ve run so far. She’s cornered here, and we both know it. I
      catch my breath for a few seconds, wipe the sweat off my brow, and throw
      open the door to the chapel. Despite its size, the door doesn’t produce
      the barest hint of a sound. In the gloomy interior of the deserted chapel,
      there is only a single individual standing within it all, the shadows of
      the silhouette long in the afternoon sun. I close the door with as fast as
      possible, never facing away from the silhouette. The distance between us
      is a mere ten meters, but the person keeps the silence that wraps over and
      above the sacred place. The person brings a hand to where the face would
      be, as if adjusting glasses, and finally I catch a glimpse of the man,
      staring at me as if I was some kind of statue. “Oho. What business brings
      you to the chapel at this hour, Miss Ryōgi?” A fleeting smile plays across
      his face, a lazy, carefree expression reserved for children. It is the
      same smile he had worn two days before, but this place seems to give it an
      air of falsity somehow, and the smile rings hollow. There, in the dim,
      clouded light of the chapel, Satsuki Kurogiri stands alone.
