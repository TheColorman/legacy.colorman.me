    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - IV</h1>
    <p>
      Sleep, Miss Kokutō. Within your hollow dreamscapes lies the grief that I
      will repeat. The last words I hear from Misaya Ōji before I descend into
      oblivion. When my eyes close, darkness overtakes me, and for a moment,
      there is a nothingness of neither dream nor sleep. And then, within the
      stirrings of the dreaming, I gaze on eternity. *** But I hate that. I want
      to be special. I said that once. But when did I say it? I don’t even
      remember the face of who I was talking to, or what I looked like at the
      time. It was a very, very long time ago. When I came of age, I’ve only
      yearned for the shadow of that one word. Like a curse, it hung over me,
      and I couldn’t love any life that led me closer to it. I don’t truly know
      why. But I know that I don’t want to be like everyone else around me.
      Awakening mundanely, living mundanely, and sleeping mundanely; I scorned
      their nature. I am me and me alone. I have to be different. The child that
      embraced that vague concept soon came to think of “different” as
      outclassing everyone else. But when I grew up, I freed myself from the
      innocent but confining vestiges of those youthful thoughts. Every year, my
      body forced itself into adulthood, and every year I kept the secret,
      deceiving everyone that I was normal; though inside, my difference with
      the other children my age only widened. Performing well in academics was
      never my road to becoming special. I wanted to be more than this, a thing
      apart altogether. It didn’t mean to the best in everything. It didn’t mean
      to be weak, either. Only something else. And it was an impulse that led me
      to abandon so many connections. With this impulse, I hurt people,
      estranged myself, sometimes even made them fear me. And it made me happier
      to slough away the excess. My friends, my teachers, and even my parents
      gave me the strange sort of distant praise that always follows those that
      clearly overreach. And through all this, some fashion of peace over my
      perturbed soul seemed almost at reach. It was a time when it almost felt
      as if something else held dominion over me, something that longed to
      return to some primal origin, predetermined before I was even born. As a
      child who followed this urge, I could never judge if it was right or
      wrong. I only knew that if I indulged it, my wish of being a different
      thing would become true. A thing apart. A thing that can’t live with
      others. A thing that can only hurt. And I tried to fool myself into
      thinking that this benefited me. But in the end, it wasn’t some princely
      figure that shook me from this stupor. It happened naturally, almost
      entirely without my notice. Now what are you doing all by yourself, Azaka?
      It’s boring to play alone. Come on home. It’s getting late. It was only
      one boy. I was ever alone, and because I allowed myself to believe that
      this was better, I hated him cruelly. But he always sought me out, always
      drew me in to play his games. When even my parents were distant, he was
      always close at hand to offer a laugh. He talked to me unconditionally. At
      first I thought he was only dim-witted, yet he would often grab my hand
      without a care, and always led me back home. Only he could have done that.
      After all, he was my brother. And it was then that I dared to hope that
      the distance I created for the sake of being different allowed him to
      entertain the thought, even if in jest and in passing, that I was not a
      child of our house, that I was of different blood. He should always be
      away from me, to nurture that thought. And though the idea pricked my
      heart like the thorn of a hedge, I came to realize that I had wasted my
      days in my obsession. I followed my brother with my eyes every which way
      he went. He never drove away a frightening dog, or defended me when my
      parents were scolding me, or saved me from drowning in a river. But all
      the same, I had to admit to myself one day that the affection I held for
      him had turned to love. And it made me hate him even more. Because how
      could I hold this irrational love for him, of all people? But no matter
      how much I denied it, there was nothing to be done about it. And I found
      myself looking forward to the little episodes where he would call for me
      as I played alone. To the child that I was, maybe the scorn was nothing
      more than an echo of my loneliness. How many times did I try to summon the
      will to apologize to my brother? I had looked down on him for so long, but
      I couldn’t let an apology form whole. He let me experience something
      better, but the child who threw away what she thought was merely dross
      found that she couldn’t muster the simple words of thanks. Sometimes, I
      wonder what my brother has done to me. He hasn’t attempted his foolish
      sermonizing, and if he had tried, he would have found me well prepared. It
      seemed almost a change of heart lacking a reason, a love without a true
      beginning. But no. There must be a reason. I’ve only lost it, forgotten
      the most important thing. And I have to remember it, so I can start
      believing in myself again, and believe that this love is certain and true.
      And when that happens, maybe I can finally say that I am sorry for the
      first time in my life, even if it may well and truly be a clumsy apology.
      *** “Wake up, Azaka. You’ll catch a cold out here.” I know that voice. It
      is a voice more a man’s than a woman’s, and when I hear it, I slowly open
      my eyes. Someone has a hand on my back, helping me up while staring into
      my face. The hand holding me up is solid and almost cold. My vision is
      still hazy, but I can more or less see that I fell asleep on some
      corridor, and someone is trying to wake me up. “Miki—” I find myself
      whispering a name, but I quickly stop myself when I see the clear black
      hair of the one I’m facing. Me and Shiki Ryōgi both notice the name I was
      about to say, and stare at each other more than either of us found
      comfortable. Until Shiki suddenly slips her hand away from my back. Then
      with a loud thud, my upper body slams hard on the on the wooden floor,
      leading to a sudden white flash of pain. “What the hell was that for, you
      ass?!” I protest before proceeding to stand up in as intimidating a matter
      as I can muster. Shiki only glances at me with lazy eyes. “Well that
      should wake you up.” “Yes, awake enough to forget whatever important thing
      it was I was dreaming, you clumsy barbarian!” I shout. It takes all my
      force of will just to stop myself from hitting her. “So you got hit by
      them again, I guess.” When she says this, I try to remember. I was talking
      to Misaya Ōji, and I was sure I captured one of the fairies while it was
      happening. She cast some kind of illusion on it. I was surprised. She
      rushed at me, made me sleep. And the next thing I knew, here’s Shiki.
      “Huh, that’s strange. They attacked me for sure, but they took nothing
      from my mind. I remember everything that happened.” “So you know who our
      fairy mage is? You’ve got a name and a face?” Shiki asks. I nod.
      Unfortunately, it wasn’t someone we had ever expected, nor someone I cared
      to accuse carelessly. I glance at my wristwatch, and I realize that it
      hasn’t been more than a few minutes since I fell asleep. Maybe she was
      planning on doing something to me, but she noticed Shiki was coming and
      made a break for it before she could pull anything off. I suppose this
      time, Shiki really did save me. “Thanks, Shiki,” I murmur under my breath,
      making positively sure she couldn’t have the pleasure of hearing it. “Yes,
      I know who our culprit is. It’s Misaya Ōji.” “That tall girl we saw for a
      while yesterday?” “That’s the one. Little time has passed between our
      conversation and now, so I’m thinking she escaped to hide from you.” Shiki
      nods in acknowledgement, putting a hand on her chin as she thinks. From
      her her furrowed brow, I can see she’s thinking that something doesn’t
      quite fit. “What’s wrong, Shiki? Having a spot of indigestion?” “Wasn’t
      she one of those that had a bout of forgetfulness too?” She’s right, but
      whatever turn of events that might imply is a secondary concern for now.
      Shiki seems to arrive at a conclusion close to mine. “Whatever, we can ask
      her what’s up when we see her. Anyway, you got a call from Mikiya. He
      asked if we could look into some student’s records, one Kaori Tachibana or
      somesuch.” “What?” I say in genuine surprise. That was a name I didn’t
      expect to hear out of her or Mikiya. I never wanted him involved in this
      business. Back in summer, he got caught up in this stupid ghost incident
      that left him asleep for three weeks. Fortunately, since Mikiya lives
      alone, our parents never knew, and Miss Tōko took care of him while he was
      in his short coma. Thank God for her, because if she wasn’t there, he
      would’ve died in three days or less. Ever since then, I’ve never wanted
      him involved in what Shiki and Miss Tōko are doing for a living. But how
      does he know about the whole mess about the fire, and what name to look
      up? I’m fairly certain I said all of one sentence about the fire to him
      last November, but surely that wasn’t enough to spark his interest. Miss
      Tōko promised she’d keep it a secret, too. Then how did he call with such
      good timing, and with information to work on? Who did he talk wi— “Oh, why
      didn’t I think of it before? It’s always you, isn’t it Shiki? You told him
      where we were going before we left, and that made him curious! And now
      he’s probably pried the entire thing out of Miss Tōko.” I say, anger
      boiling under my voice. “What?” she raises her voice in protest. “He was
      worried I wasn’t telling him where I was going, and he wanted to know!
      You’re fault for not being there to take the call this afternoon and make
      him back down.” I sigh. I hate to admit it, but she’s right about the
      call. I could have scolded him then and there and that would have been the
      end of it. Shiki shifts gears, ignoring my complaint. “Anyway, that’s done
      and we can’t do anything about it. Mikiya said something about looking at
      the girl’s PE attendance record and such. What do you think? Is it gonna
      turn up anything?” “PE attendance record?” What could that possibly tell
      us? Some kind of code, or some— Then in a flash of recollection, I
      remember what Misaya Ōji said. Kaori Tachibana didn’t die because she
      couldn’t escape from the fire. She killed herself. But there was one
      important factor that I neglected to ask Misaya Ōji, and that would be
      Kaori Tachibana’s “—reason for killing herself.” I mutter, leaving Shiki
      to raise an eyebrow. She and her questions can wait. I break into a run.
      Shiki, mystified, doesn’t seem inclined to follow me, which is all the
      same to me just now. I need to make this quick. I run out of the ruined
      dormitory, hurrying back into the path that goes straight through the
      forest and leads into the main school building. I know exactly where I’m
      going. The infirmary wing will likely have records on the students, and my
      position as class president and my dispensation from the Mother Superior
      might just be enough to get one of those records out. *** It only takes a
      little buttering up for the school nurse and administrator to cough up the
      documents I need, and within a few minutes, they allow me to peruse Kaori
      Tachibana’s health and PE records, as well as her related infirmary logs.
      Second term started from September up to winter break, and the PE for
      class D at that time consisted entirely of field trips or other
      out-of-school activities, with the homeroom instructor supervising. Kaori
      Tachibana’s October attendance record is replete with spots of absences,
      and a week before the fire in the old dormitory started, she didn’t attend
      PE class at all. Just to make sure, I ask the school nurse, and as I
      expected, she did indeed have a check-up in that period. The cards are
      starting to turn face up, but the looming presence of our enemy can’t be
      avoided as long as we’re here.
