    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - /6</h1>
    <p>
      The ashen tint of sunlight, filtered through the myriad colors of the
      stained glass windows, grant the chapel interior a sort of delirious
      quality that touches over everything; over me, and over Satsuki Kurogiri,
      standing there at the center of it all with that silly smile on his face,
      looking straight at me without any truly lingering good or ill-will. “Oho.
      What business brings you to the chapel at this hour, Miss Ryōgi?” His tone
      is not to fault me towards my brazen entry of the place, but a plain
      question, which makes it all the more suspicious. For a moment when I
      entered, I thought it was Mikiya standing there beside the altar, and it
      was enough to bring an awkward stop to my feet. But I regained my senses
      in time to pull the knife from the back pocket of the uniform, and have it
      at the ready at my side by the time we had faced each other. Now he looks
      darkly at the fine, scalpel-like blade, perhaps not knowing what to make
      of it. “Best put that away,” he says. “You could hurt somebody with that.”
      Said with all the grace of an instructor gently guiding his pupil. I
      ignore him, still scanning the chapel for signs of any other presence, but
      though the place is darkened, I can’t place any suspicious shadow or
      glint. The female student that I had chased here doesn’t seem to be
      present, and no one else is visible save for Satsuki Kurogiri himself.
      “Would you happen to know where Misaya Ōji is, sir?” I say, stopping my
      survey of the place and looking back on the man standing before the altar.
      Satsuki Kurogiri’s eyes softly cast themselves downwards. “Miss Ōji is not
      here. But it is me you are looking for, is it not? Because it is me
      collecting the pieces of scattered oblivion in this school, not her.” He
      smiles again as he says it. Somehow, I easily believe it is no lie. He’s
      the culprit, the real one, and it is a truth that is so easy to accept
      without mystery or reservation. Somehow. It almost feels like a given
      truth, long known and strangely compelling. “What the hell does that
      mean?” Well, so much for the gentle student façade. Though I think at this
      point, its usefulness has long past. I stare at Satsuki Kurogiri sharply,
      and he welcomes it with a fittingly guilty chuckle. “It means what it
      means. I am the one you’ve been seeking, though I admit the fae you killed
      is not mine. You are still a blank slate to Misaya Ōji, and she has some
      interest in you. Her false fae can do little of value to you, yet she
      insists on facing you with it. Though it is nothing more than something
      willed into being with her Art, it is still regrettable that one had to
      die.” Again, the grief in his voice seems genuine, even as he closes his
      eyes in seeming prayer for that departed thing. Still, I shouldn’t allow
      myself to be swayed by such a stupid display of compassion. Azaka has gone
      on and on about our observational role here, but with the enemy clear
      before me, there seems but one thing left to do. I’ll— “I think not, Miss
      Ryōgi,” he suddenly says, as if my mind was open to him. “The mage of the
      fae familiars is not me, but Miss Ōji. In the first place, it would be
      patently impossible for my skill in the Art to command such an impressive
      number of familiars. The only one here capable of such a feat is Miss Ōji.
      My talent lies only in the recording of words and thoughts spoken, and
      thus, my role in this has little connection to the fae. And you will not
      think me an enemy in that regard.” “Wha—” Again, his words have a strange
      ring to them. “That having been said, it does not mean I have no
      connection to the whole drama in general. Perhaps it would be appropriate
      for me to raise Misaya Ōji up from her little failure this time, wouldn’t
      you agree?” His eyes finally open again, and when I look into them, they
      have within them some unchanging peace. “I did not intend to be as
      involved as I am in this affair, but I didn’t count on you entering the
      stage so early either. Miss Ōji was only to probe Miss Kokutō’s
      capabilities, but I suppose when I revealed my hand, it was only a matter
      of time before your master sent you along as well. Seeing as I drew you
      out, it would probably be best that I be your opponent this time.” “Any
      reason you want to throw your life away so easily? Don’t see any reason
      for you to step into my blade at such a ready attitude.” “Perhaps. I
      wonder what it is you feel about the memories you have locked away deep
      inside you. Do you refuse them as you refuse me, or do you want them back?
      The plundering of the memories was Miss Ōji’s role, and mine was the
      drawing out of memories lost to oblivion. Both of you chase Miss Ōji,
      thinking to end this confusion, and yet here you find me, with a hand
      ready to grant what it is you might wish most fervently for.” I don’t
      move. I don’t even blink. There is some truth to what he says. I don’t
      think that having my hands back on the lost memories would be anywhere
      close to my liking. So far, my somewhat overzealous reaction to the
      fairies has probably been due to this, and why I’ve been so hard up for
      finally getting rid of Misaya Ōji one way or the other. Though the
      target’s changed to Satsuki Kurogiri, little about what I feel has
      changed. But there is none of that familiar feeling, none of that impulse
      telling me to take a step forward. No sense of danger emanating from this
      person before me. Odd. I know he’s the enemy, but I remain unimpressed.
      And as soon as I notice that strangely foreign feeling, I feel a cold
      chill down my spine. But it is still not that crisp clarity of purpose
      that tells me to kill. Maybe…maybe I don’t really need it. I ignore the
      chill in the small of my back, and I use the Eyes to take a clear look at
      Satsuki Kurogiri and his weird-ass smile. And with the weaving of the
      spell, the black lines of death come into view, tracing themselves all
      over his body like the calculated positioning of a spider web pattern,
      twining into itself with the complexity of a fractal. The sheer number of
      them only tells me that his is a body already prone to death, more so than
      anyone else I’ve ever witnessed. As the crazed ash tints of the sunlight
      and the darkened, electrified crackle of the lines of death intermix,
      Satsuki Kurogiri still manages to make a faint, almost mocking chuckle.
      “You’ve woven a spell. The Arcane Eyes of Death Perception, I presume. I
      claim the finite streams already travelled, but you see the infinite paths
      yet to be trodden. I record nothing but the past, and you see nothing but
      the future. Ironic that Alaya called me out here to deal with your past,
      eh, Miss ?” His eyes close halfway, seeming to glare at me suspiciously.
      But more important than the odd little ways in which he carries himself,
      only one word he said catches my complete and undivided attention, and
      even the mention of it goes some way to partially explain the mysterious
      brand of hostility that I have been feeling in my mind since I came in
      here. Alaya. There is no doubt he said that name. “Fuck. You’re a mage,
      too, aren’t you, Satsuki Kurogiri? You are my enemy, then.” I grasp my
      knife tightly. Then the strange thoughts intruding into my head ever since
      he started speaking were no coincidence. It’s his spell, no doubt. Then
      there is little else to think about. No more debate. Killing him will make
      it all right again. Killing him will end all of this. And at the end of
      reason, though I do not see myself, I feel in myself the urge to laugh.
      For a heartbeat, he looks much like Mikiya would. Another heartbeat, and I
      remember that he is a mage, on the same side of the boundary as I am,
      separated from the teeming masses, but together with me in the world of
      secrets and lies. I keep myself from leaping with reckless abandon, from
      attacking to tear his throat and taste the still warm blood. There are
      methods for this, a bit of planning to not underestimate my opponent. As
      soon as there is an opening, I’ll pounce, close with him and stab him
      vertically through the base of his throat, drag the knife downwards to his
      belly in one bated breath and finish it all in an easy three seconds. But
      in my mind’s eye, though I see the limbs scattered and bloodied, I hear
      another heartbeat. And then there is tension. My breathing quickly becomes
      ragged, and my hesitation is clear. “That is not what you will do, Miss ,”
      the mage says with an air of authority as if to emphasize a point. I
      should be at him by now, making him regret those words. But instead, they
      somehow hold me in place, preventing me from performing an action that
      something inside me tells me is purely wrong, even as my mind says
      everything about it is right. The murderous urge I usually ride isn’t
      coming for me, and I can’t bring myself to attack him, this man who looks
      so much like Mikiya. My throat dries, my tongue begins to numb, and it is
      all I can do to try and fight it, preventing the fear from manifesting,
      and push myself into final action. My body is unmoving, cadaverous in its
      paralysis. If only I could blank my mind, I know I can dispose of these
      useless thoughts and move. But I’m not. “No, I can’t.” The only thing
      which, with some difficulty, I manage to say. The mage looks me over like
      a towering watchman. “Good. You’ve stopped. You would have killed me if
      you had continued on like you did. Once, you killed the murderous impulse
      inside you named Shiki over and over again to grant yourself the illusion
      of a normal life. Now you find yourself trying to silence , and wanting to
      lean on the shadow of that same voided part of yourself. But silence , and
      you will return to the outer darkness from which you awakened from. Hmph.
      Alaya said to me that you were brash, impulsive. But all I see before me
      now is a cowardly child without resolve.” His eyes wander away from mine.
      “Alaya told me all about you, relied on me to draw you out. It is the
      worst kind of comedy of errors that puts me here even as the man himself
      has already been defeated. A shame. I had wanted to see what he could do
      with his experiment.” Some seconds pass with him saying nothing, and he
      stands in front of me, unblinking and unmoving like me, with no motion to
      run or attack. The lines of death dance in anticipation, and my knife is
      still firmly in my hand, its heat asking me how long I plan to stand and
      face him like this. I can give it no answer. In the silence that falls
      over the chapel, only my own wild heartbeats echo in my ear like a tolling
      bell, and it is not slowing down. Unable to bring myself to attack, or
      indeed, even to quell my rapid heartbeat, I decide to ask. “Why are you
      just standing there, Satsuki Kurogiri?” “The things that must be said have
      been said, and anything I say further will be answers to your questions.
      That is how it goes, doesn’t it? If you leave all this now, ignoring the
      strange paths that fate has brought together for us, then I will leave
      you, unrelated as before. Decide to fight, and I will defend myself. I
      owed Miss Ōji my help once, and that is finished now. I will do nothing
      now except to abide by your desire.” My eyebrows twitch at his peculiar
      reply. What does he mean when he puts the choice to me? Is his heart not
      in this fight? Then why did he even trap me like this? “So you’ll do what
      I want then? Fine. I never wanted those lost memories returned anyway.” My
      heartbeat races even faster as I say this, and I manage to put a hand over
      my chest to try and stop the pain. The mage looks at it curiously before
      shaking his head in a negative. “That is not what you heart is saying.
      You’ve sought those long forgotten memories for so long, and your heart
      here speaks the truth. It is to that answer that I will abide.” Goddamit.
      He’s…not lying. But I only ever wanted Shiki’s memories. The warm but
      painful memories of that old classmate. But never that one last memory.
      Not that last memory in the freezing night, with raindrops as cold as ice
      daggers on my skin— “No. Don’t do it, Kurogiri,” I say, an unexpected
      desperation creeping into my own voice. “I don’t want them back. I never…I
      just want to forget all about it, alright? That’s what I want!” I mean,
      isn’t that why I forgot about that night? Isn’t that why Shiki died and
      left only the worthless fringe vestiges of that memory as a mark of his
      passing? I’d always thought the memories would never return. He killed
      himself so I could be here, now. “I don’t need your help.” Inadvertently,
      I find that I say it with a crack in my voice. There is a small silence
      before a grin rises to his face and he answers. “My mistake, perhaps. If
      that is your wish, then it will be granted. That is the role I play.” In
      his words I can find no malice or anger, no virtue and wellness. Tōko told
      me about the fae once before I left, about how their tricks were not bound
      by our notions of morality. Only the impersonality of action, as if
      compelled by some spiritual tell or obscure ban. This mage, with his
      deliberate fickleness of mind and the arbitrary nature of his gathering of
      memories, strike me almost as fae. Why then does the man smile? Would it
      be more right for him not to? “You’re fucking weird, you know that? Even
      though you say you can only follow what I want, I don’t know why the hell
      you’re smiling like you’re so satisfied. I never wanted a smile. If you’re
      so intent on being a mirror for what I want, then you can wipe that smug
      grin off your face.” “You are correct. However, I don’t believe I am
      smiling right now. As I’ve told you before, I have never smiled.” Though
      he says this, the smile never leaves his face. “Everyone seems to see it
      that way, though. I seek to carry myself normally, but Satsuki Kurogiri is
      ever the smiler. I’ve never felt myself smile, Miss Shiki. Never even
      thought of it. I don’t understand its merit, or why people do it. Joy
      never comes easily to a man like me, and in that regard, I was similar to
      you, who once never felt truly alive. But time seems to have settled that
      matter for you, hasn’t it? Shiki Ryōgi has a future, a purpose. As for me,
      I have nothing else save the past, and it is all I see within others. Just
      as other people need to consume something to live, I am compelled to
      gather the past and reveal it. What happens after is of little concern. It
      is all up to the person himself to judge what to do with such memories,
      because I certainly cannot judge. It is not in my nature to.” The smile he
      wears seems to weaken somewhat, but it seems no less real than before.
      “Nothing else save the past? What does that mean?” “To have no past is to
      be nothing but a blank. Regrettably, my nature is weak, bound to old,
      eldritch fae. I cannot think for myself, and thus have no dreams or
      aspirations. I am like a book, written with meaning by a writer, but
      imprinted with the desires and meanings of the multitudes who read it. The
      same weakness makes me recoil from suicide, and I have no choice except to
      live. Only one thing ties me to some semblance of identity. The granting
      of people’s wishes. I don’t do it to find good in myself, yet I am
      compelled to. Like fate, I respond to the desires of men. I bring back
      forgotten time. Isn’t this clearly a desirable outcome, Miss Shiki? I only
      return what is rightfully yours.” “For you, maybe. But you just said it
      wasn’t for you to judge.” I narrow my eyes at him. I make my show of
      defiance, but inside me there is a strange ring to his words. It’s almost
      as if they’re not stopping in my mind, but continue to course throughout
      my body. Like the force that he says compels him also compels me to give
      weight to his words above anyone else’s. “Thanks for the offer, but the
      answer is still no. You don’t need to send me a letter telling me what I
      already know. Lost memories don’t come back. All that proselytizing isn’t
      going to change me.” My heart throbs inside my chest and the hand held
      against it. For the first time, our eyes meet, but his own looks at
      something farther, a hollow black that speaks of some long held farewell.
      “So even you are among those who would renounce their past. I simply
      cannot understand how you, all of you, come to this decision. Why would
      you renounce eternity so easily?” “Eternity? Making people remember old
      sins and recording them is eternity to you? Hilarious, is what it is.
      Where do you get off spouting things like that? I mean, if people really
      wanted to preserve memories, let them do it with a camera. Unlike mages,
      they never lie.” The rhetoric seems to finally pull down the smile from
      Satsuki Kurogiri’s face for the first time, and when he speaks again, his
      voice has the seed of some conviction, however small. “’What is material
      cannot in eternity lie.’ An old truth, but still just as correct. The
      stuff of this material world is not everlasting. Your Eyes tell you that
      better than most. Anything must have an observer to give it meaning, and
      the impression itself must not deviate, else it is not eternity. Even you
      cannot tell exactly if what you saw in one day matches exactly as you
      remember it. The observer’s mind is simple, and heuristic. The new becomes
      old, and the color of wonder fades. In our minds, the value of anything is
      variable and ever-changing. Entropy is more relentless than eternity, and
      we are always tied to it. Eternity comes in no shape, no form, an intent
      controlled by its beholder that can never deviate. Only the record of
      things transpired—an accurate, omniscient record—can be such a thing.”
      “Records can be changed,” I reply sternly. “This whole incident proves
      that. I don’t think you can find your oh-so-precious ‘eternity’ anywhere
      you care to look.” “Those are not records. Merely fleeting memories. Such
      things form only the base personalities of men, and like memories, they
      too change to fit an occasion, becoming little more than a dress one
      wears. You should know this. The flesh and the mind can be molded just as
      easily as you change your manner of speaking.” The mage takes a step
      toward me, and it causes my heart to jump. “The observer observes himself,
      and in turn is changed by it, identity preserved only by the cognizance of
      the weight of time. There is no such thing as a definitive personality.
      The records are the only seed of a soul that has ever existed, and its
      watch over eternity is stern. It is the scar that remains inside you even
      after yourself and the universe has crumbled under the passage of strange
      aeons, ever unchanging.” “I have literally no idea what you’re getting
      at.” “Nor did I expect you to. You and all else like you cannot
      understand. You never get it. There is no memory that deserves to be
      abandoned. Whether unconsciously or not, you all wish for the records from
      oblivion. I merely reflect this truth back.” Another step forward from
      him, bringing him farther from the altar. His awkward smile returns as he
      draws near. The heat of my grip on the knife has my palm in a sweat, but
      it is a familiar and comforting warmth. His meaningless tirade held only
      one important conclusion. This man was never like Mikiya. He never had a
      pace so careless and indifferent. That difference is all I can hold on to,
      trying to banish the unusual effect his words have on me, even for a
      moment. A moment is all I need. It takes a great exertion of mental
      effort, but I feel my heartbeat relaxing, the numbness in my fingers
      starting to disappear. The effort strains me, and I know it is only
      temporary, but it’s all I’ve got. “You say you’re not trying to find good
      in yourself,” I say casually, trying to will away the strain this is
      causing me, to maintain the illusion just a little while longer, letting
      him come closer. “Well, I can’t rightly say you’re evil or anything, just
      like you can’t call a mirror evil.” That was a patented lie. He makes
      himself out to have no choice, but clearly Satsuki Kurogiri has the
      intelligence to weigh his actions. And even then he has the gall to call
      himself harmless. “And that’s what you think of yourself, am I right?” I
      continue. “A mirror. So you can pretend that you’re not doing anything
      wrong. You’re just doing what you do. But you know what you resemble more?
      The way you push the responsibility to other people reminds me of some
      spoiled kid.” At this, his eyes gain a mad, almost fossoristic gleam. “You
      want to fight me, don’t you Miss Shiki?” A cruelly twisted smile. “Then
      let us do so. It will honor Alaya’s role for me. It would have been so
      much better if you actually chose to just ignore me, though.” The mage
      adjusts his glasses slightly and dares himself another curious step, the
      one step that puts him just in reach of one burst of speed, one strike of
      the blade. Adjusting his glasses in front of me was the biggest and last
      mistake he’ll make. The mental block still makes moving difficult, but I
      manage to pump strength into my legs to close the distance, raise my hand—
      “Your sight is lost.” I hear his voice for a split second, and in that
      vital moment, it echoes in my mind like an undeniable truth. The next
      thing I know, I see neither hide nor hair of Satsuki Kurogiri, and my
      knife swings only at empty air. “What the—” I swing my head around, left
      then right then behind me. The chapel is empty save for me, and my senses,
      mundane or otherwise, fail to find my target. He was right in front of me.
      But now he’s gone. But unbidden there comes a voice. “Close. Very close. I
      do so hate people who interrupt other people before they’re done talking.
      That attack claimed an arm from me. Ah, it is no wonder now how Alaya was
      defeated. You are truly an excellent killer.” The voice comes from dead in
      front of me. The mental block he induced in my mind still presses down on
      me, and makes it difficult to focus the spell of my Eyes. I try to bring
      it to bear. If I can’t see him, then maybe I can see his lines of death.
      “But you cannot win against me.” The voice enters my mind unbidden. But
      it’s useless. I’ve seen the lines of death, right in front of me. “Found
      you, bastard,” I spit out. I close as fast as I can, before the advantage
      is lost, not planning on letting him get away. But before I can do
      anything of value, he is gone from my sight again. “Your Eyes will not
      avail you here.” The statement echoes confidently above and below the
      chapel, and darkness rapidly begins to curtain everything. Through his
      words, I am deprived of even the faintest light in moments, and become
      surrounded by a world of darkness. “Hmph. The first tongue has less effect
      on you than I expected,” he grumbles. “The connection of both of our
      spells to the spiral of origin grants you some measure of resistance
      perhaps. But in the end, the death you cling so close to remains unseen.
      As does everything else.” His words burrow inside my ear, as if he were
      right beside me. I swing my knife in a wide arc around me, left and right,
      but hit nothing except air and a random wooden surface, maybe a pew. “A
      pointless exercise. I have already told you that you can’t win. You kill
      anything so easily, but you are brought low by simple words.
      Unfortunately, you are spared a fate of death today. That is not my role.
      And besides, in truth, I do not kill anyone. Not with words. But I can
      grant you what it is you truly desire.” His last sentence makes me shudder
      faintly. My wish. The truth about me that I never wanted to know. “No!
      Stop it! That’s never what I wanted!” I scream as loudly as I can, but the
      sounds are dead and fade into the darkness. “Now, this lingering grief
      must be retrieved and returned to you. Do not worry. Though you think it
      lost to oblivion, the memory repeats itself like a record.” The mage’s
      voice is the sound of a rhythm, as excellently plain as a musician’s
      metronome, and mathematically perfect. I feel the rhythm of that woven
      spell pierce deep inside me, and if I had a soul, it finds its terminus
      there. Unable to stop it, he reaches to my core, to , and all I can do is
