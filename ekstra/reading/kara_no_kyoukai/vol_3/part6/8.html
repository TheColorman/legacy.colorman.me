    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - VIII</h1>
    <p>
      The rain begins to fall, first in a drizzle, and then in a more steady,
      rhythmic pace that falls upon the stone and concrete, the wood and mud.
      Nothing can be seen beyond the tree line of the forest that forms a
      perimeter around this old ruin, but I stand here, little else save the
      trees in my field of vision. The rain begins to get heavier, and starts to
      ruin my view of the building, half a charred derelict that looks fresh and
      almost recently burned, and the other half miraculously saved from further
      immolation. The girls are all gathered in the fourth floor, asleep. But it
      will not be by my hand that the hammer finally falls. I wait only for one
      of them to start the cleansing fire herself. And I await only the
      cleansing rain to wash over me completely. Standing at the mouth of an
      open wall on the second floor, I see Azaka Kokutō emerge from the forest,
      her steps splashing water around her. I sigh, disappointed, and set out to
      the stairwell to meet her. *** The rain drops cling to the black uniform
      robes, and the winter weather makes them almost as cold as snow. Her
      breath is white upon the air, and her shivers are barely suppressed. Azaka
      Kokutō tries to ignore all of this, which she finds harder and harder to
      do now that she has finally arrived at the old junior high school
      building. As with yesterday, she enters through what used to be the
      building’s front entrance. The building still carries its burnt half like
      a festering wound, still hurting, but the rest of it only gives the
      impression that it has been abandoned a decade more than it really has.
      The vibrant voices of the students, once this structure’s very breath, are
      now only half-imagined echoes reverberating in the charred halls and
      destroyed doors. Now there is only the barely perceptible keening of
      something located a bit farther from the entrance, and an offensive smell
      in the air. The moment Azaka smells it, she recognizes it for what it is.
      Gasoline. That, along with gunpowder, has proven to be the materials she
      has found a constant use for in her practice of the Art, and she finds she
      has a nose for it. “What a bother,” she sighs, both shoulders drooping as
      she does. “I’m going all this way for a woman I’ve only ever met once.” As
      she walks, she retrieves a glove from her pocket and slips it on her right
      hand. The glove is a dull brown, made from leather, given to her by her
      mentor Tōko. Made from salamander skin, she uses it to channel her Art,
      giving her an ease of control she otherwise wouldn’t have had without it.
      When she finishes putting it on and flexes the fingers of her right hand,
      she reaches the stairwell leading to the second floor. She stops
      immediately upon looking up, for there, waiting in the landing, is Misaya
      Ōji. “Is obstinacy your defining quality, Miss Kokutō?” she asks, her tone
      of voice the gentle suggestion of the helpful classmate teaching a
      favorite friend. Her posture in the darkened landing, however, speaks
      otherwise. Her stance is wide and steady, prepared and looking down on
      Azaka. The air around her buzzes, filled with the keening sound Azaka had
      heard earlier, and though she doesn’t truly see them, she knows it is the
      fairy familiars that surround her, awaiting the signal from their queen to
      begin the attack. The aura of imminent danger that Misaya Ōji clothes
      herself with has not changed since their first encounter in this same
      building. Azaka recognizes the position of disadvantage she would start
      with if combat were to begin now. Misaya Ōji has the high ground, and the
      distance between them too wide to close for the kind of combat that Azaka
      would prefer to occur. As usual, however, she puts this in the back of her
      mind and tries to talk to the girl looming above her. “It’s a trait that’s
      served me pretty well. So I take it your plan here involved some mental
      suggestion, forcing the students of class D to commit suicide.”
      “Naturally. I have shepherded them here, but the task of the fire they
      must perform themselves. Only then will they pay contrition for their sin.
      I have had to accelerate my plans because of you and that other girl. Only
      a few in the class are actually on the verge of suicide because of the
      predations of memory and sorrow that have plagued the school, but you need
      only one to push everyone else over the edge.” “Hmph. No one I talked with
      seemed too far gone to be marked as suicidal, though, but that’s just my
      opinion. Still, you’ve prepared quite the stage here. Conditions are
      perfect, and the atmosphere is fairly correct for dying. A regular
      shepherd of unwilling souls, aren’t we, Miss Ōji?” I shrug, but Misaya Ōji
      seems to misunderstand the gesture and frowns. “But you came here for a
      reason other than the students, Miss Kokutō?” “Oh, of course. After all,
      an unbeliever like me has no use for stupid evaluations of crime and
      punishment like you have been doing. If it is true that some of those
      girls desire to kill themselves, as you claim, then who am I to stop them,
      right?” Azaka smiles, and Misaya Ōji can’t tell for certain whether it
      speaks of a simple ignorance, feigned or real, at the blasphemy she just
      uttered. Misaya Ōji narrows her eyes dourly. “Then what could you have
      possibly come here for? Revenge against me, is it?” “Fairly close, but
      still not dead center. I came here out of pity for you, Misaya Ōji.” As
      she says that, Azaka inspects the staircase that separates her and her
      target. Because the building was made for junior high school students, the
      steps are not that tall nor numerous. She figures that she can clear the
      entire thing in two well-timed leaps if she needed to. “Pity? For me?”
      Animosity starts to boil in Misaya Ōji’s dark almond eyes. Azaka shifts
      slightly at that, careful not to provoke her enough to dispatch her
      familiars just yet. “Miss Ōji, why did you even talk with Mr. Kurogiri?”
      “Because he is my brother,” she swiftly replies. “Right, right. And who
      did you receive your power from?” “That too was my brother’s gift.” “I
      see. When was it, then, that you recognized Mr. Kurogiri as your brother?”
      “From the very beginning.” But no sooner have the words left Misaya Ōji’s
      mouth when she realizes the contradiction, and her eyebrows twitch at the
      small revelation. Her mouth opens slightly, hanging dumbly and letting go
      of a cracked and hesitant breath when she realizes that she cannot
      reconcile the sequence of events in her mind. Azaka sees this, allowing
      the faintest hint of a smile to play across her face. “Well, that’s how it
      is, Miss Ōji. You didn’t go to talk to Mr. Kurogiri because he was your
      brother. You went to him first and foremost because he was the homeroom
      instructor of class D. And it wasn’t strictly to consult on the matter of
      Kaori Tachibana either. You’re the most powerful student on campus. You
      could have reached Hideo Hayama and talked to him directly even without
      Mr. Kurogiri’s help. And afterwards, Hideo Hayama just turns up gone,
      likely dead. In your wisdom, you probably tried to pass it off as an
      unfortunate accident, like most confused killers do. But it doesn’t change
      the fact that you killed him. And because it troubled you like nothing
      else before, you went to talk to Mr. Kurogiri. And he was only too happy
      to help, wasn’t he, Miss Ōji?” Misaya Ōji keeps her silence, her eyes
      fixed on the empty air before her as if some horrific and unseen shadow
      only she beheld stands before her, forgetting the troublesome student
      standing at the foot of the stairs and retreating into her thoughts. She
      goes back to the thoughts of her supposed brother, and she wonders when it
      was that she started to dress the role for that persuasive man. It could
      not have been when they first met. And besides, how could she remember?
      She does not even know her brother’s face. Only one possibility is left.
      She had used the fairies to plunder him of a memory. And something in that
      mind touched by fae changed her and what she saw in the man. It awoke
      latent memories, assigned him a role to play in her life. “I—I was…”
      Misaya Ōji cannot finish. “You never knew. It was never by your own
      memories that you saw Mr. Kurogiri as a brother. It was through his own
      memories that you came to that realization. A stranger’s memories, where
      no truth of your own can be drawn. He made you see what you wanted to see,
      and it was no favor. To him, you were the same as the fairies that
      surround you. As you exploit them, so does he exploit you.” Azaka
      remembers what Shiki said to her yesterday as she found her asleep in this
      building. Even then, she had already observed that Misaya Ōji had been one
      of those afflicted with forgetfulness. Maybe she had grasped upon the
      solution early and unwittingly. “This…isn’t—” Ōji stammers, breathing hard
      as if she was drowning, a glistening of sweat visible on her long neck.
      But with a single gulp of air, she manages to find herself and her voice.
      “That is a lie!” At that moment, Azaka weaves her Art as with their first
      encounter, picking out the countless pockets of heat in the air. A flash
      of a moment afterward, the heat of the fairies rush forward blindly, like
      they were responding to Misaya Ōji’s outburst of rage. They consolidate
      themselves into a thin line and speed like bullets toward Azaka. To her
      senses, the storm of heat is as fine and dangerous as a naked blade,
      slicing downward through the stairwell and toward Azaka below. But Azaka’s
      spell allows her to feel exactly when they move, giving her just enough
      time to put her back flat against the wall. She can feel the dangerous
      warmth of their flight on the skin of her face, rushing past her with
      great momentum. She wastes no time. As soon as the flight of fairies have
      gone past, she puts strength into her feet and leaps up the steps of the
      staircase. She only has a few seconds. Having deftly avoided the fairies
      that Misaya Ōji had tried to use as a makeshift weapon, Azaka has the
      benefit of seeing Ōji’s face of utter astonishment. She is up in three big
      steps, just slightly in excess of what she’d predicted. She doesn’t stop,
      maintaining her momentum and checking Misaya Ōji with a body blow to the
      abdomen so she can sweep past her to the center of the landing. She hears
      Ōji grunt when she is hit, but already she works the fairies to redouble
      the attack. Azaka stops as soon as she is past Ōji, caught between the
      tall girl and the fairies behind her that have not yet entered the battle.
      Azaka senses the pockets of heat that she had dodged swinging back around
      toward her, and the fairies only a few feet beside her start to beat their
      wings and move. Exactly as she wants. Though the fairies are like bullets,
      she will not be a foolish deer caught so easily. Azaka takes a wide
      stance, then throws out her hands on either side of her, toward the
      direction of both swarms of fairies, careful to avoid pointing a hand to
      Misaya Ōji. “AZOLT!” Azaka calls out. The lorica echoes, and she feels her
      weaving of the Art course through her, a magical ritual boiled down to a
      single moment. The tingle of the temperature rising seeps through the skin
      of both mages. The next thing they see is the eruption of a conflagration
      as startling as it is sudden, burning numerous invisible things in the air
      in a spontaneous combustion on either side of Azaka. Countless shrieks of
      anguish, high and tremulous, are heard until they all fall down silent on
      the floor. A few seconds later, when Azaka is satisfied, she clenches her
      gloved fist, and the fire extinguishes itself, the only proof of its
      passing being the smoke rising from embers on the ground. Settling her
      hands back to her sides, the firestarter sighs. “This is the true face of
      the magic which you think you’ve learned,” Azaka says. “But the Art is not
      learned. It carves your soul with truth forever, and I do not see that
      mark in you. The Art doesn’t open to you in a month or two, as you thought
      it did with you. But the contract you forged with Mr. Kurogiri offers you
      a suitable substitute, doesn’t it?” Lingering smoke still emanates from
      Azaka’s right hand, but soon that too vanishes. Misaya Ōji looks upon her
      with an expression somewhere in between amazement and confusion. Her legs
      finally give way, and both her knees fall to the ground. “So…so this is
      it…” she says blankly. Somehow, she finds in herself the will to make a
      silent smile, wishing she had realized everything so much sooner. I talked
      to Hideo Hayama about Kaori Tachibana’s death, but it quickly turned into
      an argument. I kept saying he was responsible. I blamed him for
      everything. And he kept denying it. But I was right. I’m always right. I
      was getting irrational, thinking that any measure might be acceptable. I
      recall pushing him, but after that, everything is a haze, but it fades to
      me, facing his still-warm corpse. And for the first time in my life, I
      didn’t know what to do. I sought the help of Satsuki Kurogiri. After all,
      talking to my father or the university president would be suicide. But
      he…he had a presence to him, like he could solve everything and grant my
      every wish. To a person like me who valued only merit, this man of little
      attachment to anything was a mystery to be solved. He could save me. And
      as I had desired, he gave me all I needed to settle everything. Satsuki
      took the role of the beloved brother I’d lost so long ago. Satsuki made
      real the power I needed to pay back Kaori’s death. He always said that
      clean hands need not touch that which was tainted. Why did I never notice
      that it was not myself and the other students that he spoke of? He said
      that in order to not be dirtied, one must use someone else to do it for
      you. He understood then, as I understood, that all the students of class D
      had to die to pay. If only I had realized earlier that all will be the
      same in the end. “If I had said nothing, all would have gone better,”
      Misaya Ōji whispers. She is looking at the wall, but it seems altogether
      like she is looking at some vast emptiness beyond it, paying no attention
      to me standing beside her. However, I’m sure the words are for me to hear.
      “I knew, but something kept me from remembering. I loved him, and it made
      me not want to destroy the fantasy he crafted just for me. I didn’t want
      him to love anyone else, and in turn I loved only him. But it would always
      be a secret. Even if he thought nothing of me.” The story she recounts is
      an old one, for her and me both. And I have to acknowledge its
      familiarity, sickening though it is. I could have said the same words
      myself. “I can’t live without at least acknowledging that,” Misaya Ōji
      says, muttering it mournfully as if saying it out loud were the gravest
      sin she could have done. “Miss Ōji, you should know that it was Mr.
      Kurogiri that drove Kaori Tachibana to suicide. He never loved you. Only
      made you believe you did. The revenge you sought so much is meaningless to
      him,” I say without bothering to think through. “Don’t be foolish, Miss
      Kokutō. I told you, did I not? All of that was known to me. All I need do
      was remember.” Hands and knees on the floor, she bends down and hides her
      face in a position of prostration. I hear her making a noise, which I
      mistake at first for laughter. Only when I look closer do I see the wet
      tears falling to the floor from hidden eyes. I leave her there, in the
      building where children once roamed, now only as pathetic and lonely as
      she is. The rain that fell upon the forest earlier in the hour has gone
      into a thick fog, obscuring the trees and hiding the path back home in a
      dreamlike haze.
