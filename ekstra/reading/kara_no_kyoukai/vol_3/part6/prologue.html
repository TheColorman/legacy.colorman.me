    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - Prologue</h1>
    <p>
      Beyond the briar’s thorns there once was a deep forest, wrapped in fog.
      From it wafted the smell of green and the tiny whispers of insects. And
      deep into it, I passed. And further still did I walk. Until I chanced upon
      a knoll untouched by our sun, where I found myself in the company of
      children. And finally I did come to my senses, and realizing the lateness
      of the hour, resolved to press home. “But you needn’t go home. For here,
      your eternity awaits.” The forest children began to sing. And I wondered
      what eternity was. “It is when you linger.” “It is when you are
      unchanging.” The chorus of cradles recited in melancholy unison. Starlight
      shone quietly on the grass of the mound. The fog flowed together like
      purest milk behind me. And over my shoulder, the path home had been lost.
      I know little of this eternity. I try to hurry home. To a home far from
      this place. A home far from the children and the forest. And wrapped in
      the smell of green and the tiny whispers of insects, Inside the deep
      forest, wrapped in fog beyond the briar’s thorns, They denied me home for
      an eternity.
