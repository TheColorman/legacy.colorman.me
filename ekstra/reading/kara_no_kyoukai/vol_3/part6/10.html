    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - X</h1>
    <p>
      After finishing his classes for the day, Satsuki Kurogiri heads back to
      his room. The weather had maintained a fine cloudy firmament since
      morning, and it cast the corridors of the school in the filter of a
      monochrome portrait, and about as still and silent as one as well. He
      opens the door to his room, taking in the sights of it well. It is filled
      with little knick-knacks and assorted objects, books and tomes. But they
      carry the air of having not been played with, or having not been used with
      the intent of study at all. The books all look like they were as new as
      the day they were bought, and maybe they have never been opened. Gray
      sunlight streams in from the window, lending a façade of frozen time to
      the entire place. As soon as Satsuki Kurogiri can confirm that all is in
      place just as he had recorded in memory, he steps inside. With a sharp
      thud, he closes the door behind him. At the same time, he feels a sharp,
      piercing pain. He lowers his glance, seeing only a Reien student standing
      only a head below him. Somehow, he feels like he should know her. She
      holds in her hands a knife, which she has buried deep into his stomach,
      the blade barely seen. “Who are you,” he asks weakly, though not in anger.
      The girl student refuses to answer. Her hand trembles on the blade’s grip,
      and Satsuki Kurogiri feels every vibration inside of him. The student
      cannot even look up at the one she had attacked. He observes her. Height,
      weight, hair, skin color, structure. As far as he has recorded, only one
      student fits the bill closest. “It’s you, isn’t it?” asks Satsuki. “You
      waited here to murder me.” She still refuses to answer. Satsuki offers her
      a shrug, and a gentle hand on her shoulder in order that her tension would
      drop. “Then go. Your part in this act is done.” The words, spoken without
      malice or hatred, even in the end, only succeed in making her trembling
      worse. The disquiet in the girl is evident, more at unease, it would seem,
      from the truth of his statement than from act of assault she had just
      committed. A few more precious seconds pass until the girl finally
      releases the knife, as though relinquishing it to the man she had stabbed.
      She hurries away, out of the room. Catching his last glimpse of her, he
      still cannot be sure who he is seeing is as he assumed. Who was she? All
      the characteristics he had recorded were correct except for her hair. It
      is shorter, he thinks, cut wildly and with little care. Still, something
      as broad a change as that means that for Satsuki Kurogiri, the girl is as
      good as a stranger met for the first time. Struggling, he closes his door,
      securing the lock with a satisfying click. Every step he takes scatters a
      few droplets of blood to the floor, dripping lazily from the wound where a
      knife still clings to. That last act finally saps his last remaining
      strength, and he is forced to lean on the nearby wall, his body sliding
      down slowly against it until he is sitting upon the floor. He thinks that
      death will be of little concern, since he has long ago known it would end
      with something like this. He looks down on his weakened body. Ironic. He
      finds that it too is different from the Satsuki Kurogiri recorded in his
      mind. Maybe that is why death does not engender in him the kind of fear
      that grips most people. He collects himself, even as the bleeding
      continues to worsen by the second. He knows there will be no relief here,
      and that death will come in mere minutes, perhaps ten. He sighs, deciding
      to use these minutes the best way he knows how. But ten minutes is too
      short. What should he think, or feel, or imagine? But time is a lesser
      problem. He is born now, and will die only ten minutes later. A lifetime
      of minutes, perhaps more worthy than other years walked on the good earth.
      Think, he tells himself. Imagine. He consumes the larger portion of his
      final minutes considering in this way, barely feeling the pain in his
      stomach. And in this mysterious last lifetime of clarity, he is surprised
      he can find an answer to his deliberation. His breathing is rough. The
      minutes are long. The bleeding is dire. The life is short. He clears his
      mind from all other extant thoughts, and focuses on that one answer so
      that he can tell it to himself. “Maybe I will think of what I thought
      before I was born.” It is the last oblivion he can draw from, the time of
      memory that no human has. The world before one was born, with no symbolic
      value, and no conflict. His distress is a very simple thing. “If I had not
      been born, the world, and myself, would maybe be a lot more peaceful.”
      Happy and content, Satsuki Kurogiri smiles. He fails to understand the
      meaning of the gesture. But he understands the value of it now; realizing,
      for the first time in his life, that he is actually smiling.
