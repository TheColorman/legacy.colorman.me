    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - II</h1>
    <p>
      I leave the faculty room of Reien Girl’s Academy’s senior high school
      department…unfortunately, with her tagging along. “You know, I’ve been
      thinking. Maybe Tōko is actually an idiot and we just didn’t notice.”
      January 4, Monday. Past noon. Skies partly cloudy. Walking astride me is
      Miss Tōko’s funny idea for something “better than a pair of eyes.” The
      enemy. “Having you of all people to sneak into the school with me? For
      once, you have my agreement.” “This sucks. I definitely got the short end
      of the stick this time, having to put up this act that I just transferred
      here on the third term.” We try to avoid looking at each other as we walk
      through a corridor of the senior high school building. The girl’s name is
      Shiki Ryōgi. Like all students here, right now she’s wearing the Reien
      uniform, a dress patterned after a black nun habit that almost always
      looks weird on any Japanese person. And yet Shiki wears it like an old
      glove. When I see her dark hair still distinctly visible even against the
      black fabric of the dress, and how it can’t hide her slender shoulders and
      the pale whiteness of her nape, even I have to admit that she looks good
      on it; as good as any quiet Catholic girl, which of course, she is
      anything but. The entire thing gives me a faint feeling of disgust.
      “Azaka, those two girls were just staring at us.” And of course, like an
      idiot, Shiki is staring right back at the upperclassmen we just passed as
      well. It hasn’t been the first time it happened today, and after a few
      looks, I think I have an educated guess as to what could be so interesting
      to them. In an exclusive all-girls institution like Reien, the androgynous
      nature of Shiki’s appearance must be some kind of anomaly. There are few
      people like Shiki in here, and her presence is bound to attract some kind
      of attention. The same two girls that we just passed must have only wanted
      to talk to her in some kind of childish attraction. “Don’t pay them any
      mind. You’re a new face. Transfer students at this level are just rare,
      that’s all,” I caution to her. “It doesn’t have anything to do with what
      we’re investigating.” “There’s a surprising number of students for the
      winter vacation, don’t you think?” “Ugh. It’s a boarding school,
      obviously. A lot of these people live far away, and would rather just stay
      here over the break. Only the library on the first and fourth floor are
      actually open, but since the dormitories are well-stocked anyway, barely
      anyone heads to the main building. Unless you need to report to the nuns
      for violating some rule.” Rules which are very, very strict, and the
      violation of which enough times is enough reason to expel you. “Don’t go
      outside” being the most tightly held one, and they won’t make an exception
      even if your parents themselves showed up. Still, money has proven to
      change that easily enough, which I found true with my erstwhile friend,
      Fujino. As a man of capable capital who donated significant money to the
      school, Fujino’s father found a way to get her out whenever she wanted. As
      for me…well, certainly my high grades helped, which led to my uncle being
      employed by Reien as a painter (which completely suited his mercenary
      motives for letting me go here). They were more lenient of my excursions
      after that. Remove the religious veneer and Reien itself is little
      different from other high schools. Students still study their backs off
      just to pass a test to get into college, and with all the high
      expectations for the student body here, that fact is only doubly true. In
      truth, I suspect the school took me in because of my high marks, seeing me
      as someone they can proudly send off to Tōkyō University (which had been
      my plan anyway). While the management in this place might be a bit too
      focused on what numbers they can boast about, it doesn’t really bother me.
      I mean, at least they can give me the freedom to go out. I snap out of my
      reverie in time to notice that we’ve exited the main building, and that
      beside me, Shiki had been staring at it with listless eyes for quite some
      time. Then, as if tiring of it, she looks back at me while idly fondling
      the cross hanging from her neck. “Weird place. Can’t rightly tell if the
      teachers are primarily teachers, or dedicated to being nuns, or whatever.
      Oh yeah, and didn’t we pass by a chapel earlier? Is that where they do the
      whole ‘mass’ thing? Our Father, with art in heaven and all that?” Oh,
      Shiki you ignorant fool. What would God do with art? “There’s a morning
      and evening service,” I reply, “and a mass on Sundays. Students aren’t
      obligated to participate, though. People like me who transferred to Reien
      from elementary or junior high largely aren’t Christian, so we don’t go.
      The nuns would rather we do, but…well, you know the law. The sudden influx
      of rich-but-not-necessarily-Christian families sending their well-to-do
      daughters here increased dramatically over the past decade, which, coupled
      with the number of parents not wanting to put their children in schools
      that force a Catholic education, forced them to tone down the mission
      school vibe.” “What a pain in the ass,” Shiki sighs. “I’m willing to bet
      God doesn’t care either way.” To see her dressed in the uniform she’s
      wearing while wielding such a vulgar tongue makes me feel a little uneasy.
      I quickly dispense with the subject. “Well, never mind God for now, but
      what about the fairies? See anything? Any weaving of the Art?” I ask as we
      continue to walk the campus grounds. Shiki shakes her head. “Not a glance.
      Guess we’ve got no choice except to wait until tonight,” she says, casting
      her sleepy eyes across the buildings, the abundant foliage, and the stone
      walkways that adorn the school. Shiki, like many mages, can see what is
      hidden from most normal people. The mystic sight of her Arcane Eyes allows
      her to see ghosts and spirits…and even things with more frightening
      implications. Her breed of sight grants her dominion over death and
      entropy, and it manifests for her as patterns of lines on an object, and
      supposedly, by tracing them she can weave entropy into it and destroy it.
      Apart from that, her family claims a strong martial tradition, and
      whatever else may be said about her, she has still lived up to it
      exceptionally. Because of that, her reflexes are as fast as she is
      efficient and brutal. In other words: a woman quite the opposite of my
      brother Mikiya. Totally unsuited for him. Above all other people, it is
      perhaps Shiki who annoys me the most. As a matter of fact, the entire
      reason for me taking up Miss Tōko’s tutelage in the Art is Shiki herself.
      Because if Mikiya’s girlfriend was any normal girl, she would never
      measure up to someone like me. But obviously, Shiki is a far more
      troublesome sort. So I put aside my common sense and took Miss Tōko up on
      her offer. Now, I’m still learning, but I don’t feel I’ve measured up to
      her just yet, so I spend my days here in the school, balancing my time
      between mundane study and the practice of the Art. But even though I
      consider Shiki the enemy, there is one truth about her that I have so far
      refused to give voice to. “I’ll have to spend the night in your dormitory,
      I imagine. Normally, I don’t like sleeping on a bed I haven’t checked and
      prepared myself, but in this case I’ll have to lower my standards.” Shiki
      bookends the sentence with a sigh of surrender. See, the truth is that
      Shiki doesn’t really hate me. And I don’t really hate her either. I’ve
      always thought that if only Mikiya wasn’t between the both of us, I would
      probably be the best of friends with her. “So where to next, Azaka?” Shiki
      asks as she looks at me. “To the dormitory?” “It might be better for us to
      use what little time we have actually investigating and not idly resting
      in my room, I should think. We’ll talk to class D’s homeroom instructor,
      so just follow my lead. You’re my seeing-eye dog for the duration of this
      case, and you’d do well to use those Eyes to scrutinize everyone you come
      across.” “Wasn’t the homeroom instructor some guy called Hayama or
      somesuch?” “Old news. Mr. Hayama left the institution in November. The
      homeroom instructor now is Mr. Satsuki Kurogiri, the only male instructor
      in the school.” I start to walk back inside, heading toward the English
      language teacher’s quarters, while Shiki tags along dutifully beside me.
      “A guy teacher in an all-female school. I guess that must stir up some
      latent feelings in some of the girls, huh?” I don’t answer her right away,
      but in her own crude way, she’s right. The students of Reien are brought
      up to be to the school’s vision of ideal young women, and men are seen as
      a hindrance to that growth. One of the main reasons the school strongly
      discourages venturing outside the grounds is because they think that a boy
      and a girl interacting at their age is a slippery slope to an illicit
      sexual relationship. But I’ve always thought that having male teachers
      undermined that philosophy anyway. “Well, yes,” I finally answer after a
      moment’s pause. “But that topic’s practically a minefield in this place,
      so keep your voice down. Hideo Hayama wasn’t a popular teacher here not
      only because of his suspected lack of an actual teaching license, but also
      because there were rumors that he’d sexually harassed a student once.”
      “What? Why the hell wasn’t he out of here sooner, then?” Shiki asks with
      cocked eyebrow. “The sisters and the Mother Superior were forced to turn a
      blind eye to it because…well, let me put it this way: The surname of the
      school board’s chairman is Ōji, but before he married into his wife’s
      family, he shared a surname with Mr. Hayama.” “Oh ho,” Shiki whispers
      conspiratorially. “The chairman’s estranged brother or something, I
      suppose. If that’s the case, then I guess the question becomes: why did he
      resign like he did.” I scan my head around quickly just to check if no
      one’s around. Satisfied, I turn back to Shiki and say, “Remember last
      November when we were in Miss Tōko’s office? I said it then too, but the
      short of it is that a fire broke out in the high school. Only the
      dormitories of class C and below were affected, but the fire itself
      supposedly started in class D’s section, and they said Mr. Hideo Hayama
      was behind it. Obviously, the chairman himself sacked him, but Mr. Hayama
      was already long gone by then. Perhaps he ran.” News of the arson never
      really slipped outside the walls of the school. All the firemen were
      purportedly bribed, as were an ample number of the student’s parents and
      guardians. Wouldn’t want to tarnish the good name of the school where
      their precious daughters went to after all. It took one other toll. There
      was…someone that died in that fire. “So this Kurogiri guy—what’s he like?”
      Shiki asks. “Very little to say about him, really, save for his being
      quite the polar opposite of Hayama. I don’t think there’s anyone in the
      school that hates him. He started only last summer, and unlike Mr. Hayama,
      he didn’t have a crutch to get him in here, though I hear the Mother
      Superior was quite enthusiastic to have him. From what I hear, she
      actually wanted to have a teaching staff that was native English—like our
      long gone sister school—but were able to speak Japanese. Of course, such
      people are rare. But Mr. Kurogiri was just such a man.” “So he’s one of
      those English teachers, I take it?” Strangely enough, Shiki scowls as she
      asks this. Perhaps her preference for all things Japanese has given her
      some kind of nervous allergy towards anything English related. “Yes, but
      with a license to teach French and German too. He’s even studying Mandarin
      now, and some South American language. It’s no secret why we call him the
      linguistics geek. I confess, it sometimes makes him a hard person to deal
      with.” I stop myself from saying anything further, seeing as we now find
      ourselves in front of the door to the English language teacher’s quarters.
      In Reien, teachers do most of the paperwork in the faculty office, but all
      of them are quartered in their own accommodations. This room is for the
      English language teacher, and is the same room that Hideo Hayama once
      used. I inhale a gulp of air, careful not to let Shiki notice it. Then I
      rap gently on the door two times before opening it. Once me and Shiki
      enter the room, we find Satsuki Kurogiri with his back to us in the far
      end of the room, concentrated on the work at his desk. His workspace faces
      the window, from which ashen gray rays of sunlight enter from the overcast
      sky outside. Like any good professor, thick stacks of paper lie in heaps
      in seemingly random places all over the room: on top of a chair, or a
      cabinet, or peeking out from inside a drawer, all in some kind of order
      known only to him. “Mr. Kurogiri. I’m Azaka Kokutō of class 1-A. Did the
      Mother Superior tell you about my business?” “Yes,” he replies,
      accompanied only by a curt nod as he looks over his shoulder. He only
      swivels his seat around to face us. When his face meets ours, I do not
      fail to detect Shiki’s sharp intake of breath. It doesn’t surprise me. In
      fact, I expected it. I too, reacted in much the same manner of momentary
      confusion when I first saw him. “Ah, Kokutō. Yes, I have been informed.
      Please, both of you, take a seat. I trust there will be some explaining to
      do.” His voice is as gentle as the smile he now wears. His age seems to be
      around his mid-20’s which, if true, would make him the youngest instructor
      in Reien. His unassuming features, coupled with his black-rimmed glasses,
      easily make him look among one of the least imposing ones as well. “You
      are here for my account on class D, I imagine.” “Yes, sir. Specifically,
      your account on the students that tried to hurt each other with box
      cutters.” My reply makes his eyes squint, his gaze placed far beyond me,
      and containing, for a moment, a heavy sadness and disconsolation. “It is
      regrettable that I cannot help further in that regard. I myself remember
      little about what actually took place. My memory is vague, but I know that
      I could not stop the two girls in time before they hurt themselves. I know
      I was there in the scene, but everything after that is unreliable, I’m
      afraid.” He closes his eyes. Why is this man and he so alike? So ready to
      throw himself at another person’s problems when it isn’t his turn to
      bother himself with it? Both of them don’t seem to be the kind of person
      that would harm anyone else, much less not move to stop a dangerous
      situation as with the two students. “Sir, did you know the reason for
      their quarrel?” I ask, if only to make sure, but Satsuki Kurogiri only
      shakes his head silently in reply. “According to the other students, I was
      the one that stopped them, but I certainly don’t recall such a thing
      happening. I’ve been called a forgetful person many times, but this, I
      think, is the first time I’ve forgotten something so important. As for the
      reason of their argument, I honestly don’t know. It’s possible it could
      even have been me. I was, after all, in the same room as them when it
      started. Even I would think that is enough reason to investigate me.” His
      brooding expression darkens as he says this. I cannot say that I wouldn’t
      doubt myself either if I was in his place. It would seem suspicious to
      anyone that he was there when the actual event happened, and yet he
      couldn’t do anything, and doubly so when he can’t remember even a fleeting
      moment. Having self-doubts would be the sensible progression from there.
      He doesn’t know what he did, if he were in some kind of triggered fugue
      state, what kind of time and memories he lost. But while suspecting
      yourself might be reasonable, especially with a lack of any compelling
      evidence to prove otherwise, worrying more and more about what happened
      would eat away at you, until you couldn’t escape. “But sir, couldn’t it be
      possible that some students of class 1-D were still in the classroom as
      the entire event unfolded? Have you asked all of your students?” “Yes, but
      they remain silent about it, as if they all just want to forget about it.
      Memory is a fickle thing, and I cannot rely on theirs just now to be
      entirely truthful. The question of how involved I was is still very much
      up in the air. Regardless, I think you will gain little more from me by
      asking me about it. I know I myself might seem unreliable at present, but
      if you have more questions left, I will be happy to answer them.” He
      smiles again, more weakly now, and I nod at him and answer. “Yes, let’s
      continue. You said that they don’t want to talk to you about what
      happened. What do you think might be the reason they hesitate to confide?”
      “I can’t say for sure. The class has always been particularly…strained,
      even on the day I took charge of them. Maybe it is not my place to say,
      seeing as I haven’t been their homeroom instructor for too long, but they
      are unusually quiet.” “Do you think they might be scared?” As I ask that,
      I wonder why no other student could have stopped the two girls from
      cutting each other. Could the letter have found all of the students of the
      class instead of just two? It could be an explanation. It makes everyone a
      suspect for the sender, and instantly makes them suspicious of the two
      girls. Perhaps they would have seen the fight as the two girls outing each
      other as the real sender. But Mr. Kurogiri’s answer doesn’t support my
      theory. “No,” he replies slowly, letting it churn in his mind. “Not scared
      I think.” “Then what?” “It would probably be more right to say that they
      are…reserved, maybe guarded. Against what, I cannot really say.” I don’t
      fail to take note of the nuance. In other words, he might be saying that
      the problem has always remained internal to the classroom, never coming
      from, or reaching any other third party. “Sir, can your students be
      contacted at present?” I feel like I have no other recourse except to be
      direct and ask the students. The whole affair about memories being lost
      makes Miss Tōko’s fanciful fairy theory more likely by the second, and
      I’ll have to ask the people spreading the rumors about that as well.
      “There is no need to contact them. They are all here in campus, so you can
      talk to them immediately if you want to.” That genuinely catches me off
      guard. All of them, here in school? Is that coincidence or something else
      at work? “Perhaps later. For now, though, I have another engagement. I may
      have more questions at a later date, though, if that will be alright.
      Shiki, let’s go.” The girl has been uncharacteristically silent for the
      last few minutes. I catch her attention and motion for her to follow when
      I stand up. It is then that I notice Mr. Kurogiri staring blankly at me
      and Shiki, his gaze eventually falling to Shiki in particular. “Um, sir,
      is there something—” before I can finish and Mr. Kurogiri can answer,
      Shiki finally speaks for the first time. “Miss Azaka refers to me by name,
      sir. My name is Shiki. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.” A miracle.
      She must be channeling some effort of supreme will to even talk as gently
      as she does now, and I can’t tell if it’s dripping with sarcasm or not.
      With her, you can never really tell. “Yes, your silence made you a bit
      conspicuous. I am sorry,” the instructor says. “I don’t believe I’ve seen
      you before. A freshman, I presume?” “Perhaps. Only time will tell. I am
      touring the school’s facilities, you see. If I find it satisfactory, I
      might transfer.” “Clearly you’ve already found the uniform satisfactory.
      Do consider hastily.” says Mr. Kurogiri with another curt nod. He looks at
      Shiki with a look of positive delight beaming on his face, noticing every
      detail on her like an artist would on a model. A gentle knock on the door
      interrupts their conversation. Then a voice from outside, muffled by the
      wall. “Excuse me.” The door opens with a slight creaking, and in steps an
      upperclassman, her almond eyes looking over the room with a cold
      detachment, and the slight breeze drifting in through Mr. Kurogiri’s
      window making her back length black hair ripple slightly. Reien is already
      home to many fair looking women, but even here, this girl stands out. Her
      face is known to me. I wouldn’t forget the face of our student council
      president since last year. When she looks at you, she almost seems to be
      viewing you from above, and the long, thin eyebrows give her a countenance
      of stately command. “Ah, Ōji. Is it time already?” Mr. Kurogiri says to
      the student, Misaya Ōji. “Yes, it is, sir. Well past the appointed time,”
      she replies confidently. “You were expected in the student council room at
      one o’ clock. Time is not eternal, so we have to make use of it as best we
      can, do we not? Without even batting an eyelash, Ōji berates the erring
      instructor. She carries her majesty with a grace only she can muster, and
      it is an asset she uses to rule the student council as tightly as she can.
      By the time I had transferred, she was already in place at her position,
      but according to what Fujino told me in the past, not even the sisters
      could touch her. And if the rumors are to be believed, nor can the school
      board chairman, with whom she shares a surname. It’s only natural,
      considering the family they hail from. The chairman, who married into the
      family of his wife, will obviously have a large discrepancy of influence
      from the Misaya Ōji, the family’s second daughter. The Ōji are plutocrats;
      old money families with their name on a building or street or two. They
      have a strange practice of adopting female babies for daughters, and their
      marriages are arranged, taking only the best grooms into their family. Any
      marriage with the Ōji daughters of the family force the grooms to take the
      Ōji surname, while the daughters are brought up to be individuals of
      strong force of will to become scions to their financial empire. Such an
      upbringing has made Misaya Ōji a woman with a heart of iron. Still, she is
      not a complete tyrant. She does, in fact, possess a strong sense of
      justice. She shows no mercy to those who violate school regulations, but
      to those that uphold it, she is a sister and a role model. She is even
      devoutly Christian, and goes to the noon mass every Sunday without fail.
      “As strict as ever, Miss Ōji. Perhaps a more flexible view of time and
      eternity would be wise.” Grinning, the instructor stands up and leaves his
      seat, Misaya Ōji watching his every move with visible impatience. Surely
      to a woman who values discipline like her, the leisurely pace of Mr.
      Kurogiri must be extremely vexating. Ōji glances for a moment in my
      direction, and then to Shiki, raising a doubtful eyebrow as to our
      identity and presence. Realizing that we’re surely bothering her just by
      being here, I pull on Shiki’s arm to signal to her that we shouldn’t press
      our luck, and had best get out now. “Let’s move on, Shiki,” I whisper as
      we move to the room’s exit. Mr. Kurogiri opens the door for us in a manner
      not unlike a butler sending off some visitors, and I’m compelled to mutter
      a quick sorry and a bow before I step out. “No, no,” the teacher quickly
      says. “It is I who am sorry for not being of more help. A pleasant winter
      break to the both of you.” He gives us a last smile goodbye. “Do you
      always smile so sadly, sir?” I whip my head around just in time to see
      Shiki say that to Mr. Kurogiri. He only widens his eyes, not in surprise,
      but more of expectation, and nods. “Hmm? But I have not once given you a
      smile, my dear,” he says, though the fleeting expression on his face seems
      to say otherwise. After leaving the English instructor’s room, me and
      Shiki make our way quickly toward the dormitory. We pass through the large
      quadrangle on the way there. Reien Girl’s Academy has a campus almost as
      big as a university, and the layout of the buildings reflect this. The
      junior high school, senior high school, the gymnasium, and the dormitories
      are all located in separate buildings, in what seems an effort to keep the
      student body walking as much as possible. The distance between the school
      buildings and the dormitories is especially notorious, requiring you to
      pass through a small forest located on the grounds. Fortunately, a walkway
      with a roof exists so you don’t get lost and can travel through it in just
      your indoor shoes. After going through the quad, we find ourselves in this
      path toward the dormitory, each step taken by me and Shiki creating a
      subtle echo. I glance over at her, and recognize that she seems a bit
      strange…more so than usual, at any rate. Something seems to be bothering
      her. I think I know what it must be. “Surprised to see Mr. Kurogiri look
      so alike to Mikiya?” I ask her out of the blue. “Yeah,” Shiki says,
      nodding meekly. “Yet a bit handsomer than Mikiya, I’d say.” “Maybe. Can’t
      seem to see anything wrong with him.” Ah, so we agree. When I first saw
      Satsuki Kurogiri, I was taken aback—much like Shiki was—at how similar he
      was to my brother, in both appearance, and the atmosphere that they tended
      to exude. His trait of accepting everything as it is seemed only stronger
      than Mikiya’s by dint of age. To people like me and Shiki, who can’t seem
      to help being disjointed to the people around us, meeting a person like
      that is always somewhat of a shock. To look at Satsuki Kurogiri is to
      remind myself of the truth that I can’t bear to face: that I’ll never be
      normal like Mikiya. I can no longer remember when it was exactly that I
      realized this to be fact, but I know that I cried. Somewhere, buried in
      the forgotten memories of my earlier years, lies the scene of the moment
      when I understood him; understood that as I lived under the same roof as
      him, I grew to love him more and more. The paradox of my existence.
      Brothers and sisters aren’t supposed to entertain such thoughts, I know,
      but I regret nothing about it. If there’s one thing I regret, it’s my
      inability to remember that pivotal moment. “Still, no matter how much he
      looks like him, that man is not Mikiya Kokutō, but still a man named
      Satsuki Kurogiri. Don’t mistake one for the other,” I caution to Shiki. I
      can tell, even as she walks beside me, that she holds the same view. But
      instead of nodding, she frowns and murmurs. “It’s not that they look like
      each other. It’s more like—” Her words fade away by themselves as she
      stops in her tracks, looking deep into the forest that surrounds us.
      “Azaka, there’s something inside the forest. Some kind of wooden building,
      maybe? What is it?” “Oh, that. That’s the old junior high school building.
      It hasn’t been used for a long time, and it’s actually going to be torn
      down this winter break. Why ask?” “Gonna take a look at it. Thought I saw
      something. Go on ahead without me.” With a rustle of the uniform robe she
      wears, she starts to run double time to venture into the wood. “Shiki!
      Wait! You promised you wouldn’t go wandering around by yourself!” I shout
      after her, but I realize it is futile. The brat is so willful, it’d take a
      miracle for me to pull her back with meager shouts. “Azaka Kokutō?” Before
      I can start after her, I am stopped by someone calling my name from behind
      me.
