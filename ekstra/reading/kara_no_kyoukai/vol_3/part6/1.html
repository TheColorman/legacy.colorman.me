    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - I</h1>
    <p>
      December this year was less cold than I had anticipated, but was still
      enough to bring a white cloud of breath with every whisper. Nevertheless,
      yesterday was its final day, and with it, the final day of the year. Today
      is a new year, my sixteenth one. Surely, for many people around the world
      today, they are greeting each other in a warm “Happy New Year,” treasuring
      the one chance in a year they can share the warmth and sense of new
      opportunity with other people. Not for me, though. In fact, New Year to me
      has become the time of the year where I want to chide myself for my
      stupidity, a time when the pillows in my room are in danger of my desire
      to hurl them against the wall and stomp on them to vent; a time where I
      just want to will the rest of the day away. Sadly, human hearts and memory
      are not such convenient things. And so it is with a certain glumness of
      spirit that I hurry and make my preparations to go to Miss Tōko’s office.
      Though I belong to a thoroughly pedestrian household, my family still
      Insists that I dress in a kimono for the first shrine visit of the New
      Year. Indeed, they’ve already lain it out for me in my bed. Still, I’ve
      never been one for the traditional clothing, so I ignore it and head out
      of my room to go downstairs. “Oh, Azaka dear, are you going out?” my
      mother asks as I climb down the stairs “Yes. Just going to meet someone
      who I owe a favor to. I’ll be home before dark,” I say with my best smile
      as I depart from the Kokutō residence—my household. The sky of the early
      afternoon day is filled with clouds, and not too friendly ones, it seems.
      Still, I think for a while that it reflects my mood perfectly, and just
      that little bit of acknowledgement (by the world no less!) eases my steps
      just a bit. I didn’t always hate this particular time of the year. There
      was a time when, just like any other person, I actually looked forward to
      it. But it was in 1996, exactly three years ago from this day, when that
      changed; my thirteenth New Year when I went back to my real home for the
      holidays. The story truly starts with me, Azaka Kokutō, and the weak
      constitution that my body was cursed with. I’ve never had any high grades
      in PE, and everyone could tell the Tōkyō air was bad for my continued
      health. And so with that reason, the family packed me away to live with my
      uncle in the countryside when I was only ten years old. Since then, I only
      came home during summer and winter breaks, but even then I couldn’t stand
      to go back. My uncle treated me like his own adopted daughter, and raised
      me away from my family. I preferred to keep it that way—even past the
      point where my constitution eventually improved to become normal and
      render the entire arrangement moot—for my own reasons. For you see, I have
      a brother, Mikiya Kokutō. And I love him. To clarify, this is not, as you
      might be suspecting, the familial love between close siblings, but the
      romantic sort of love between a boy and a girl. Of course, one might
      suspect that a ten year old elementary school girl might be mistaken, and
      it would not be wrong to assume such a conclusion. But I was no idiot,
      even back then, and I knew better than most exactly what sort of affection
      I was entertaining. And though I can accept my assumption of my possession
      of higher than average intelligence as a comfortable lie I can tell
      myself, I cannot accept that my feelings for Mikiya are anything other
      than real. Once I even harbored childish thoughts of somehow spiriting him
      away from other people, never to let another see him. Though my feelings
      have since taken on a more sensible form, my fondness for Mikiya never
      wavered. I’ve known from the start that this was a feeling never to be
      voiced, so as I grew older, I only waited, biding my time for a chance.
      Even my retreat to the countryside was all part of my elaborate plan to
      separate myself from Mikiya, all for the sake of building in him a
      propensity to see in me something else, something other than being his
      little sister. I don’t care what it says in the family registry. I left
      that behind long ago, and I’ll only truly come back after Mikiya’s
      forgotten me as a sister completely. Until then, though, I’d spend my days
      like a lady of manners. After all, I know exactly what Mikiya likes, so
      this was a fairly simple process. It was a plan so perfect even I have to
      marvel at its genius. But then of course, a meddler had to make her
      goddamned appearance. Pardon my words. It was three years ago, back in my
      junior high school days when I first explored the notions of love. It was
      the winter holidays, and I went back to the house when, of all the
      stupidest things to do, Mikiya brought home a classmate of his. It was
      clear for anyone to see that he and this woman named Shiki Ryōgi were
      dating. And when I saw this, I had the curious and not altogether pleasant
      feeling of having baked yourself a lovely cake, only for it to be beset by
      the desperate and hungry the moment you look away. The thought that my
      brother, who always seemed so aloof before, would now be dating a girl,
      had never entered my wildest imaginings. I mean, think about it. He’d
      never even so much as looked that way at any woman before, let alone had a
      relationship with one! I think I spent the next few days after that in a
      complete daze, sleepwalking maybe, until I finally came back to the
      countryside. It was not long after that when, still in distress over what
      to do about the girl, I got wind of the traffic accident and coma that
      befell Shiki Ryōgi. And so Mikiya was alone once again. I must confess
      that when Mikiya told me the news by letter as I sipped my tea on the
      terrace of my uncle’s house, that I sympathized with the poor girl. Even
      though I only met her once, I remember her laughing heartily at what
      Mikiya had to say, her attitude full of energy. But I would be lying if I
      didn’t say that I felt some measure of relief. No girl of idle interest
      like Shiki would ever catch Mikiya’s eye again. All I need do was graduate
      high school with recognition, and get myself into a sufficiently reputable
      university. Only a few more steps; a few more years—perhaps eight—until
      the notion of my sibling relationship with Mikiya was severed. But my
      enemy proved herself to be no common ken indeed, because only last spring,
      Shiki regained her consciousness. Mikiya was beside himself with joy at
      the news as he told me over the phone, but it only served to harden my
      resolve. I would say nothing to him about my feelings, but only until I
      graduate from high school. I would need to be frank with myself, more so
      than before. And from there, I picked up the pace. My choice of high
      school was perfect: a boarding school called Reien Girl’s Academy, where
      tax bracket mattered more than grades when entering. This suited me
      perfectly, as did my uncle, who, being a painter and artist, was only too
      eager to ingratiate himself with potential patrons by my presence in the
      institution. And so I lodged there, to become a lady in their fashion.
      It’s been half a year since my entry there, and now I’m living another
      accursed New Year, again reminding me of Shiki’s continued existence. I’d
      actually planned to go to the shrine with Mikiya today, but that got
      soured easily enough when Shiki came by earlier and left with him. Strange
      how fickle such things tend to be in my life, and how she always seems to
      be at the center of it all. I make my way toward the bay area, the sight
      of the once great factories serving as my guide. The old industrial area
      by the bay is still home to some active steelworks, but by and large it is
      a place of rusted smokestacks and crumbling brick walls, of old and
      abandoned warehouses, some of which still have asbestos flocked within
      ceilings. In the midst of it all stands the shell of an office building,
      remaining eternally unfinished in its construction; no doubt the last hope
      to revitalize the district, only to falter and fail. My tutor in the Art
      of magic, Tōko Aozaki, somehow got her hands on it (through means I am not
      entirely confident are legal), and made an office of sorts there, for her
      “business.” When I reach the building, I go in and climb the staircase,
      each click of my heels on the steps an echo. The first floor is a garage,
      and only Miss Tōko herself knows what lurks in the second and third, and
      the fourth is the office where me and my brother Mikiya often end up in;
      Mikiya as an employee, and I as an apprentice. I open the door on the
      fourth floor office and announce my arrival with a lazy greeting. “Happy
      New Year.” “Mmhmm. Happy New Year,” says Miss Tōko with an equally languid
      expression on her face. Somehow, the usual severity that Miss Tōko
      commands doesn’t seem to diminish her good looks at all. In fact, in
      tandem with her white blouse and black trousers, it makes her seem more in
      control, if anything. With her glasses off, as they are now, you might
      even doubt for a moment if she was actually a woman. “Weren’t you planning
      to go out with brother dearest today?” she asks with a characteristic lack
      of restraint from behind her work desk. “I was, but Shiki came along and
      spirited him away. Still, aren’t you glad I’m even in today instead of
      gallivanting about with Mikiya?” “That I am. I have some business to talk
      about with you, actually.” That’s strange. It’s very rare for Miss Tōko to
      involve me in her business. I make her a cup of coffee, and whip up some
      tea for myself, before finally taking a seat for myself. “So, what is it
      you wanted to speak to me about?” She puts her hands behind her head and
      leans back on her chair. “Just wondering whether you’ve confessed to
      Kokutō yet.” Oh, for heaven’s sake. I can tell from her tone that she’s
      not at all serious about this. “No, I haven’t. And it’ll be that way until
      after high school, at the very least. Now is there actually anything
      significant in my answer that made you so anxious to ask me?” “Nah. Just
      speculating on how calm your answer would still be if I asked the same
      question with Kokutō present. I suppose I still wonder how totally
      different you both are yet you still find an attraction for him. Maybe
      you’re adopted. Ever considered that?” The tips of her lips rise into that
      familiar sly bend of a smile. “Now I really don’t know if you’re joking or
      not,” I reply, but holding in the frown I was supposed to make at her. As
      if she somehow still read this, Miss Tōko chuckles lightly. “Ah, Azaka,
      you carry yourself with such scholarly grace, but sometimes the purity in
      your answers is so refreshing. Forgive me and my stupid questions. I need
      to get it out of my system at least once a year, shouldn’t I?” “Well, I’d
      say you’re off to a roaring great start to the year then. Anyway, what was
      it you really wanted to talk about?” “Something about your school. You’re
      in your first year in Reien Girl’s Academy, right? The way I hear it,
      something interesting happened to class D of the freshman year. You
      wouldn’t know anything about it, would you?” Class D? I think I have a
      hunch what she’s talking about. “The class with Kaori Tachibana in it,
      right? Unfortunately, I’m in class A, so I know very little about the
      goings-on in class D.” “Kaori Tachibana, you say? Can’t say I recognize
      the name. Not on the list I have, at least.” Miss Tōko frowns, like she’s
      wracking her brain for something she missed. I tilt my head slightly to
      the side, wondering if there’s some miscommunication between me and her.
      “Er…what’s all of this about?” I mutter. “So you don’t know,” she sighs.
      “Guess I should’ve expected it, seeing as Reien Academy tries to isolate
      each class from another. Only the girls in class D would know more, I
      suppose,” she concludes. “Anyway, let me tell you what I know about it.”
      Miss Tōko begins to tell the story of a strange incident that happened
      only two weeks ago. Just before winter vacation, two students of Reien
      Girl’s Academy’s senior high school class 4-D had some kind of argument,
      and in the end, tried to stab each other with box cutters. For such a
      thing to happen at Reien, which is, at the best of times, eerily still and
      silent that it seems almost like a place hermetically sealed-off from the
      rest of the world, strikes me as supremely odd. Worse, I never knew about
      it, a fact which I can probably blame on the school’s practice of
      separating each class from each other, and their tendency to cover up
      anything that might paint a bad picture of the institution. “That’s
      horrible,” I say, after Miss Tōko is done with the story. “Are their
      injuries serious?” “Nothing too serious. I’m actually more interested in
      the fact that they attacked each other at all.” “Yes, I see what you mean.
      Reien is generally not the place you’d find the type of people who’d try a
      knife fight in the halls. Whatever its cause, it must have been something
      serious, or something far back in their past. Or both.” “Right. The
      subject of their quarrel comes later. There’s an even stranger tidbit
      here. No doubt you’re wondering why you didn’t know about this earlier.
      Reien’s policy on these things can be blamed up to a point, but it largely
      isn’t their fault this time. It’s just that it wasn’t immediately
      reported. It was only when the school’s Mother Superior looked through the
      infirmary’s records did she find the names of the two girls, and the cause
      of their wounds. She suspected class D’s homeroom instructor of
      deliberately hiding the incident.” That would be Hideo Hayama, once
      Reien’s only male instructor, and one of the only two in its history. But
      he’d already left, having taken responsibility for the breakout of a fire
      last November. He was promptly sacked and replaced, not by a nun as per
      usual, but by… “Mr. Kurogiri? No way. It can’t be him,” I suddenly find
      myself saying. Miss Tōko offers a nod. “The Mother Superior said as much.
      Apparently, this Satsuki Kurogiri fellow took to the job well, and became
      trusted by everyone almost immediately. When the Mother Superior
      interviewed him about the incident, he supposedly couldn’t recall anything
      about the incident happening under his watch. She had to go and recite the
      particulars of the incident to even make the guy remember. She couldn’t
      pry a thing out of Satsuki, and he genuinely seemed to have forgotten
      about the entire thing. Never struck the Mother Superior as a man to tell
      stories. Since he’d proven his trustworthiness before to both the faculty
      and the students, the Mother Superior had to let him go.” But how can a
      man forget something so important in only two weeks? It just doesn’t seem
      possible. At the same time, I myself can’t see a reason why Mr. Kurogiri
      would have any reason to break the school’s trust in him. “As for the
      reason the students took a stab at each other in the first place,” Miss
      Tōko continues, “all the other students heard about it, since the two
      girls started arguing in the classroom just after class when people were
      filing out in the halls. Apparently they each somehow knew of some old
      secrets they were keeping from each other. And here’s the kicker. When
      they were interviewed, they were both secrets that both of them had
      already forgotten.” “What? That sounds—” “Ridiculous, I know. These girls
      were childhood friends. The Mother Superior described them as always being
      together. Somehow, this secret got out and ruined all that. I think they
      both said when they were questioned that it was close to a month ago when
      they got a letter in the mail, and at first they couldn’t figure out
      anything about what the letter was referring to. Then, of course, they
      later understood what it was about. It told of old secrets that they both
      didn’t want the other to know. They confronted each other, and found out
      that both had been sent a letter of the same nature before they busted out
      the box cutters and started attacking each other.” I don’t know what to
      say. Forgotten memories and secrets being mentioned in a letter sent by
      someone who they didn’t know, somewhere in the country? “You’re thinking
      this is a new case, aren’t you, Miss Tōko?” “Maybe. The letters didn’t
      have anything else written on them. No threats, no demands. Not even a
      stalker could watch both girls 24/7 enough to even figure out the past
      that even they forgot about. If there’s a mage’s hand in all of this, I
      wouldn’t be surprised. I only wonder what the ultimate objective is.” The
      ominous tone of the story starts to sink in. Discounting the damaging
      contents of the letter, it might be interesting, even funny, for you to
      receive letters about your life at first and not know where they’re coming
      from. But give it a month and see if you still feel the same way. Letters
      about you containing facets of your life that even you didn’t know about,
      written by somebody you don’t know, some unknown figure who watches you
      day in and day out. The paranoia that gripped the two girls must have
      eaten away at them. It’s little wonder they were driven to such desperate
      suspicion. “Have they found out who sent the letters?” I ask. “Yep.
      Fairies, they say,” Miss Tōko states succinctly. “Pardon me. Could you
      repeat that?” I don’t know if my astonishment at what she just said
      registered in my voice or not. “Fairies, like I said. What, you don’t know
      about them? Even when so many students in Reien say they see them? I
      suppose you really aren’t gifted with Arcane Eyes, but it’s sort of a
      famous rumor among the students. Fairies, they say, will play beside your
      pillow at night, and when you wake up, you’d find some of the memories of
      the past few days will have gone as cleanly as though they never happened.
      If it’s true, and not just some crazy rumor, the fairies are stealing the
      memories for some purpose. My gut tells me there’s a connection to this
      and the incident in class D,” she explains patiently. Though I still study
      the Art under her guidance, and I’ve seen wonders of thaumaturgy performed
      that are a true sight to behold, I still find the fairy story hard to
      believe. “Do you think it’s true, then, Miss Tōko? This fanciful story
      about fairies?” “I can’t say anything about something I haven’t seen yet,
      but if there’s any place for fairies to be, it’s got to be Reien. Think
      about it. It’s perfect for them: Isolated in the sticks, where you can’t
      even hear the faintest whine of a car engine, maintained by some of the
      sternest rules and quiet nuns, that don’t permit the latest in youth
      culture to seep into the institution they’ve built. The forest that takes
      up the larger portion of the grounds is deep and large enough to get
      yourself lost for half a day if you’re not careful. The air is tinged with
      fragrance sweet enough to make you stay and pass the time staring at a
      clock’s minute hand and its lazy progression. Sounds pretty much like a
      fairy freehold to me.” “Wow, I am surprised you know the campus
      so…intimately, Miss Tōko.” “Obviously. I’m an alumnus there, after all.”
      This time, I make sure to have my voice sound truly astonished. “WHAT?!”
      “Stop giving me that look,” Miss Tōko says with an eyebrow raised. “What,
      you thought Mother Riesbyfe would just mouth off the latest school gossip
      to an outsider? She’s the one that contacted me last night to see if I
      could do anything to get to the bottom of what’s happening in there. I
      don’t exactly run a detective agency here, but I couldn’t turn down the
      Mother Superior either. Now, I can’t go in there again, since I’d stand
      out too much. I wouldn’t get a word out of anyone. So I thought long and
      hard—” she draws the two words out with a smile on her face “—on who could
      do it for me… Azaka?” No. I turn away from her. I don’t want to hear what
      I think she’s about to say. She looks at me with sharply narrowing eyes
      before she continues. “Oh come now, Azaka. It can be fun! I mean, come on,
      what do you think of when I say the word ‘fairy?’” “Tinkerbell?” I quickly
      blurt out, as if this would somehow dispel the topic, at which point Miss
      Tōko chuckles. “A comforting image, and one that is popular among mages
      who try to make familiars in the image of fairies. But unlike familiars,
      the true fae are not creatures brought forth through the mage’s will, but
      actual living things of varying species. Such things may be goblins,
      redcaps, or the oni of our own country. Shifty creatures, the lot of them.
      In Scotland, there are still stories of fairies causing mischief among
      people…even some stories where they cause bouts of forgetfulness among
      people, and drawing children into forests to spirit them away for a week,
      replacing them with identical fetches. Though their pranks vary, all fae
      share one unique quality: their lack of empathy for the victims of their
      tricks. They are simply incapable of it. They do it because they deem it
      fun, not out of malevolence. “The incident in Reien could be their
      handiwork, but the act of writing a letter seems to be out of their style.
      It indicates some kind of malice and manipulation, doesn’t it? I fear,
      Azaka, that our culprit may be the first kind of fairy that you
      mentioned.” As ever, Miss Tōko never misses an opportunity to teach me
      more about the invisible world she seems to walk through with so much
      ease. And like a good student, I’m only curious for more. “So you’re
      saying they’re familiars, being controlled by some mage?” I ask. She nods
      in satisfaction. “Yes, and the kind borne from a captured creature, to be
      sure. The mage is probably using them to work his or her Art from afar, to
      do something with the memories of the students in Reien. To have this
      hedge wizard be so obvious in his work is almost uncharacteristically
      amateurish for a mage. Or perhaps he doesn’t have such a complete command
      over his fairy familiars yet. They’ve always been fickle sorts, and mages
      generally favor other things over them. But this rank amateur has showed
      his hand, and I’m thinking it will be a perfect test for you, Azaka. And
      so I order you as your mentor to investigate the truth behind these
      incidents before winter vacation ends. Find the source, and do what you
      can to eliminate it.” There we go. Miss Tōko finally says the words I
      suspected she’d been meaning to say all this time. In truth, the task
      scares me a bit, since I can sense her hidden implication: that I’d be
      going in there alone, against an individual similar to me and Miss Tōko,
      able to manipulate the very threads of reality with the Art. And she
      expects me to root him out. I try my best to hide my trepidation with a
      confident nod. “Well, if it’s for the sake of more arcane knowledge, then
      I guess I have no choice,” I sigh as I answer. Miss Tōko rises from her
      chair to give me some documents on the details of the situation, but
      before she can hand me a folder, I have to voice the once concern that’s
      been niggling at me since the moment I suspected what she would have me
      do. “But Miss Tōko, I can’t even see the fairies. I don’t have the mystic
      sight or Arcane Eyes like you do.” Unexpectedly, she makes the grin that
      has only heralded her own brand of mischief. “Oh, don’t you worry your
      pretty little head about that detail. I think I can cook you up something
      far better than a pair of eyes.” Though she struggles to hold her laughter
      in, she doesn’t tell me exactly what she meant.
