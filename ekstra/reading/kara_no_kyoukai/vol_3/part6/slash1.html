    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - /1</h1>
    <p>
      Got a new job for you, Shiki. In the evening of January 2, Tōko said over
      the telephone the words that set me up for a job that has so far been
      completely different from anything she’s sent me before. A strange enough
      incident occurred in Azaka’s school, Reien Girl’s Academy, but the task of
      rooting out its source was barely enough to get me motivated at all. I,
      Shiki Ryōgi, joined Tōko Aozaki’s outfit some months ago purely on the
      promise of the possibility of murder. But this job? This is about as far
      as you can get from that objective without being a doctor and doing the
      polar opposite. It’s not nearly sufficient to fill me up, let alone
      satisfy me. Yet even as I think that, I recognize that despite the
      promises of opportunities that Tōko said she would have in spades, I know
      that I’ve yet to truly kill a single person. Oh sure, there was that one
      time with the girl who could bend things just by looking at them, but that
      didn’t pan out as well as I’d hoped. At the last moment, even though the
      bloodlust filled me more than it ever had, I couldn’t take her down. Not
      as she was at that particular moment. But we had a good fight. One of my
      best. I suppose it’s a compromise I’ll have to live with. The past few
      weeks held little opportunity for any similar excursions, however, so a
      hungry dissatisfaction had its grip on me. Surely it must have been the
      cause for me accepting such a dreary job as the one I’m in now. Besides, I
      had nothing better to do anyway. As I see it, there’s little difference in
      sleeping in my room out of boredom, or going to Reien Girl’s Academy and
      sleeping in Azaka’s dormitory out of boredom. At least in the latter,
      there are more opportunities to get out and move. And so I’m here, in this
      stuffy girl’s boarding school, posing as a touring prospective transfer
      student intending to go in on the third term, and trying to find fairies
      that Azaka can’t see. As I pass the tree line, I slow my pace down to a
      brisk step, and when I realize Azaka doesn’t seem to be tagging along, I
      walk. Deeper into the foliage lies the wooden school building I’m heading
      for, just visible within the shroud of green and brown that obscures my
      vision in all directions. Whether because of the cloudy skies or some
      other, unseen influence, the sunlight peeking through the treetops is a
      shade of gray more akin to mist. The distance between the buildings of
      Reien Girl’s Academy is so unnecessarily vast that time and neglect has
      allowed the foliage to grow largely unchecked except among the most
      travelled paths. The majority of the campus is filled with a vast,
      sprawling forest. Forget having a forest inside the school, try saying
      that there’s a school somewhere in the forest. The soil is damp with leaf
      mold that clings to my boots, and it fills the area with a familiar
      fragrance, the color and air of bittersweet ripened fruit. And as it
      unites with the noise of the insects on the leaves, I am almost
      intoxicated by it. Time seems to take its leisurely pace here, and there
      is a comforting familiarity to it all, creating the deceptive illusion of
      being apart from the world. I remember then the mage who made a building a
      reality all his own, and the old memory of the Ryōgi estate, walled off
      from greater society. Both of them, I realize, are places isolated from
      the normalcy of the world. So it is with this school. Soon, I reach the
      building, which I now see is in the center of a clearing of long cut-down
      trees. The design of the building itself is old-fashioned, even without
      recognizing its wooden make, and it sits breathless at the center of the
      trees like a creature asleep, or a man on his deathbed waiting for the end
      to come. The ground in the clearing is overrun with grass weeds, and my
      steps are muffled and silent when I set foot on them. Treading across them
      as fast as I comfortably can without breaking the silence of the place, I
      enter the building. Inside, I discover it isn’t as run down as its façade
      would have me believe. I get the feeling that the structure is smaller
      than it looked somehow, possibly because Azaka said this was the former
      junior high school building. Every footfall on the wooden floor gives an
      audible creak. The noise echoes across the desolate hallway, growing more
      indistinguishable the farther it travels, and blending with the noise of
      the insects outside, still audible even in such a dead space. As I walk
      further inside, my thoughts turn to the teacher Azaka introduced me to
      earlier. Satsuki Kurogiri. Azaka said he looked very much like Mikiya, and
      she’s right. But that isn’t truly special. A lot of people look alike,
      after all. But when the atmosphere he gives off is similar as well, it
      becomes truly unsettling. But there I feel some fundamental difference
      between them, some clear distinction that’s on the tip of my tongue,
      though I can’t rightly place it just yet. It’s a particular feeling I’ve
      been having lately. Of not knowing, but feeling. It’s a very human thing.
      When I first stole back into consciousness half a year ago, I was still
      gripped by that inexplicable feeling of simultaneously knowing and not
      knowing, of experiencing something and getting an emotion of newness and
      familiarity at the same time. But the past months have borne new
      experiences, experiences that not even the old could have ever known
      about. Now, more than ever, I can feel how truly distinct the before the
      accident and myself after the recovery really are, though it is still a
      faint boundary. Slowly, the hollow in my soul that Tōko once told me of is
      being filled with new memories, trivial realities, and little emotions.
      There still lingers that old lack of a sensation of life, but the
      emptiness I had when I first woke up is well and truly gone. Someday
      maybe, when the day comes that this hollow soul is really filled, I can
      even begin to grasp that faint dream of being normal. “Our little dream,
      isn’t it, Shiki?” I whisper to myself. Inside, I know there will be no
      answer. “A fool’s dream, I would think.” Yet from somewhere unseen,
      someone answers. The voice is little else but a low murmur, but it echoes
      down the hallway until it becomes a sound that blends with the cacophony
      of insects. And then for a moment, behind my neck, something pricks me.
      “Goddamit.” The light touch brings me back from my distant thoughts.
      Quickly, I move my hand to the nape of my neck, and I’m certain I’m
      holding…something. It almost feels like the shape of a model figure of a
      man, only slightly larger than my hand. Without a second thought, I hold
      tightly and crush it. It makes a conspicuous high keening sound. I draw my
      hand back and look at the palm of my hand. Only a strange white liquid is
      left. With my palm spread, the thick, sticky liquid drips down to the
      floor. Is this the only thing left of the thing I crushed? Then I remember
      what Tōko and Azaka said about the fairies. I never saw anything of the
      sort in my entire time here, and I can’t tell if this crap in my hand is
      something related or not. “Ew,” I remark as I whisk my hand to clear the
      substance away. Strangely enough, despite its almost adhesive quality
      before, it slips off of my skin quite easily now. It takes me a moment to
      notice that while I was studying the liquid, the entire place had become
      deathly quiet. Even the keening sound of the insects had disappeared. If
      they were even insects. If what I destroyed was truly a fairy or something
      like it, there couldn’t have been just one of them. Something so easily
      destroyed would serve little use for a mage. There must be a swarm. And
      the buzzing noise might have been them, their master deciding a hasty
      retreat after having observed my overenthusiastic destruction of their
      comrade. In any case, I don’t think there’s anything left for me to find
      in this building. Going back through the trees the way I came, I make my
      way back to the walkway in the middle of the forest, where I had left
      Azaka, and soon enough I catch sight of her again. Azaka stands only a
      little shorter than me, with hair that reaches the middle of her back. If
      the girl Ōji, who we had met earlier, carried herself with the air of a
      castle’s queen, Azaka carries herself much like a princess. Well, a
      princess of stubborness if nothing else. I exit the tree line and approach
      beside her, whereupon she finally notices me. “Huh? Decided against it,
      Shiki?” she asks, perplexed somehow. “Decided against what?” “Going there,
      idiot.” She motions her head to where I just came from, toward the old
      building in the woods. We share an expression of bewilderment with each
      other for a while until I finally realize what happened. “Azaka,” I ask,
      “do you know what time it is?” “It should be around 2pm, righ—” her words
      cut off. I know why. It’s already around 3 o’ clock. “I didn’t expect you
      to stand around waiting for me for an hour. If you remember what happened
      in that hour, we’ve got no problems, but…” I trail off. Silently, Azaka
      begins to tremble, putting a finger on her lips as if just now figuring it
      out. She doesn’t even attempt to hide her surprise as she stares into
      space. But I can already tell that as far as she knows, she can’t remember
      a thing from the time she called out to me to the time I got back. “Shiki,
      it couldn’t be that I—” her words come out in fits and starts as she
      trembles from head to toe, not out of fear, I start to recognize, but more
      out of pure anger. She can’t seem to stand the thought of someone having
      done something to her without her even knowing. “I don’t know if I even
      need to say it,” I start, giving voice to what she’s so far refused to
      say, “but the fairies got you. Took the memory away too, probably.” As
      soon as I say it, her face turns beet red. Her realization of her own
      carelessness at being snuck up on like a novice mage and her embarrassment
      is probably making her hard to decide between being ashamed or being
      angry. Most of the time, Azaka is very calm and collected, but she doesn’t
      like people to know that she can pop a fuse just like anybody else, very
      unlike the image she’s worked so hard to cultivate. Azaka clears her
      throat before she speaks. “We’ll go back to the dormitory. It seems we
      need to plan strategies of our own.” Her voice has gained an irritated
      streak, and her walk is brisk and determined. As I look on her, back
      turned to me, I wonder what she’d say if I said I actually admired her in
      times like these? “Shiki, are you coming or what?” she says, almost to the
      point of shouting. Well, guess I’ve got no time to think about it. I
      follow her quickly, going along with her antics like I promised to.
