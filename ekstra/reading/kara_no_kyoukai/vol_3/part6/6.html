    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - VI</h1>
    <p>
      “Let me bring up the file on Satsuki Kurogiri.” On his end of the line, I
      can clearly hear Mikiya tossing a thick stack of paper to a desk, and then
      getting a new one. Regrettable that he looked up so much, but I don’t
      think I’ll have any further use for any information he might have gleamed
      about Satsuki Kurogiri. With Hideo Hayama’s acts and the secret of class D
      now brought to light, I have nothing further to do. Whether Misaya Ōji
      would do anything or not, the case is Miss Tōko’s now. “No, it’s fine,
      Mikiya. In all probability, me and Shiki will be departing the premises in
      short order. Just wait for me there in the office.” “That so? Still, I
      don’t think it might be completely useless not to hear this stuff. After
      all, it might not be completely unrelated.” Something about the tenor of
      his voice presses the weight of what he’s about to say. “What, is Satsuki
      Kurogiri involved in the prostitution ring as well?” “Nah, this one’s a
      totally different thing. He’s got nothing to do with the class D incident.
      Azaka, do you know where the guy was born, by any chance?” The name would
      probably automatically make you think he was Japanese, but I did hear he
      studied abroad for a long time. Maybe his parents were Japanese, but he
      wasn’t really born in Japan. “I couldn’t say for sure,” I state. “But I
      have heard tell that he was in Britain for quite some time. Are you saying
      that that’s where his family stayed?” “Yeah, it seems that he was born in
      some small town in Wales. He was put up for adoption when he was ten years
      old, and he was given the name Satsuki Kurogiri by his new parents in
      place of his old name. Pretty weird that they’d change the name of a kid
      that old, too.” Not too strange, I should think, if his adoptive parents
      felt that it would bring them closer to their child. Though this is the
      first time I’ve ever heard of something like that, and of a child being
      placed for adoption at so late an age. “Anyway, I did a little checking on
      him,” he continues. “Apparently he was considered some kind of wunderkind
      way back when. Bright, full of talent. But he did something to make his
      parents hate him and put him up for adoption. It was a while before anyone
      actually adopted him, but apparently some Japanese national from a far-off
      city picked him up. Since he studied in schools there, what happened later
      is easy to find out with the paper trail, but before he became a kid for
      adoption, his history is fuzzy.” This is certainly a very strange story,
      and one that, on the surface at least, doesn’t seem to fit Mr. Kurogiri.
      And more than that, the fact that Mikiya could actually find someone who
      knew about this portion of Mr. Kurogiri’s past is quite a feat in itself.
      One has to wonder what sort of information network he tapped this time. “I
      wonder why his parents would put their child up for adoption, even though
      he’s some kind of genius,” I muse. “Could it have been money problems?”
      “There’s the rub, isn’t it? To be precise, he was only a genius until he
      was ten years old. After that, he somehow lost it. I couldn’t find out if
      it was because of some mental damage or something, but what happened was
      that when he was ten years old, he became unable to remember things.
      Anything he saw, he couldn’t remember, and for a while he was almost
      considered mentally retarded. And when that happened, his parents couldn’t
      put him up for adoption fast enough.” “He couldn’t…remember?” Something in
      there rings similar to the rash of memory problems that Reien has been
      experiencing of late. “But I didn’t get that from him. He seems to
      remember what he experiences now, and he’s a fairly well-read man.” “Well,
      I’d imagine. He wouldn’t have even gotten a teacher’s license otherwise.
      It was probably some kind of miracle, though. He got his genius back at
      some point after he was adopted. When he was fourteen, he got into a
      university program, and eventually earned a doctorate in linguistics by
      the time he was in his early twenties. It was looking good for him. He
      chose a career in academia, and was employed in a lot of universities and
      colleges. There’s something strange about that, though. There would always
      be a suicide—” “—in the school, from one of the students, right?” I say,
      suddenly getting it. “I know it isn’t such a special thing for kids to
      commit suicide in schools these days. But there’s the pattern. Every time
      Satsuki Kurogiri is employed by a school, and then leaves, there’s always
      some kind of student suicide. Now, far be it from me to establish a causal
      link, but I’m just telling you what I see. A coincidence like that in ten
      or twelve different institutions? Can’t be, right?” His words send my
      thoughts racing. A professor leaving a trail of grisly suicides in his
      wake. Could he actually be related to the events unfolding now? But Misaya
      Ōji said that he was being manipulated like a tool. He lost memories as
      well, and was led to believe that nothing was truly out of place in class
      D. I thought the mastermind of all this was Misaya Ōji. What did this man
      do? How deep in this was he? “Anyway, that’s all the stuff I got,” Mikiya
      concludes. “The rest of the legwork is on you. Don’t overwork yourself
      now. And try not to get separated from Shiki.” I open my mouth to respond,
      but he interrupts me before I can begin. “Oh wait, one last thing. I heard
      something about Satsuki’s name. Apparently the name ‘Satsuki’ is supposed
      to be some kind of weird translation of the word Mayday. I don’t really
      know what that is, though.” But I do. May Day is the first day of May, and
      also the day of the Beltane festival that celebrates the coming of the
      summer sun. And Satsuki is the name of the fifth month in the Japanese
      lunar calendar. In that context, the name Satsuki does make sense. May Day
      or Beltane aren’t exactly widely celebrated holidays in Japan, but I know
      something of their significance. And if I’m right— “Mikiya, do you know
      what happened to Mr. Kurogiri that temporarily removed his mental
      proficiency?” “If rumors count, then yeah, but take from them what you
      will. The rumors about him was that he was taken, or replaced, or
      something like that. Apparently he disappeared from home for three whole
      days. When he came back, he’d already changed.” “Replaced, and then
      changed. His name is fairly suspicious for this kind of thing. Like
      Halloween and the summer solstice, May Day is supposed to be a time when
      the fairies come out to hunt, and when seeing them is common, and that’s
      exactly when it happened to him. Thank you, Mikiya. I’ll talk to you
      soon.” I put the receiver back on the phone quickly, not sparing any more
      second than I have to for my goodbye. Mikiya was right. This information
      was relevant. Miss Tōko’s last words before I left echo back to me now.
      Commanding fairies as familiars is a fool’s game. It’s only a matter of
      time before they are no longer fulfilling your wishes, but turn you into
      fulfilling theirs. Be wary of these familiars foreign to the mage’s soul,
      Azaka. They can just as easily turn you into their own chattel. Foolishly,
      in my rush to find the culprit, and find out what class D was truly
      hiding, I’d missed the basic questions that I still lacked. The reason
      Kaori Tachibana was driven to suicide in the first place, for example,
      which Mikiya had handily supplied. Misaya Ōji had said that the fairies
      only make away with memories still alive in one’s mind, but never the
      forgotten records and emanations of such memories. But who drew these
      records from oblivion and gave them form through the letters that
      circulated with the students? And given the new knowledge that Mikiya
      generously shared, that question now begs another fundamental mystery
      which I had forgotten. Who had taught Misaya Ōji how to manipulate her
      Art? *** “Thank you, Mikiya. I’ll talk to you soon.” Having left Mikiya
      with just that little bit of pensiveness, the phone immediately cuts off.
      “Azaka?” Mikiya tries to ask, but he knows an answer isn’t forthcoming. He
      shakes his head in disappointment as he puts the phone receiver back in
      its place. He gets the feeling that this is terribly more complicated than
      he’s been led to believe, and he just doesn’t know about it. He returns to
      take a seat behind his desk. It’s January 6, just after midday, and no one
      else is present in Tōko Aozaki’s office save for himself. Tōko herself is
      out on her own excursion, but Mikiya was supposed to be on leave today
      anyway, so his being here is not entirely proper. But of course, since his
      sister, Azaka Kokutō, and his friend, Shiki Ryōgi, are tangled up in some
      new case, he has to be here and keep watch on the phone. Not for the first
      time today, he worries at why those two should have tackled a case so
      early in the year. He hasn’t the vaguest idea what the case is even really
      about, or any word if it’s safe for the both of them. He didn’t really ask
      anyone outright if the two were going on another investigation, but a
      terribly annoyed Shiki only mouthed it off the day after New Year,
      seemingly without any regard to any kind of secrecy Azaka had made her
      swear to. Then that was that. According to her, she was supposed to pose
      as some kind of prospective new student in Reien, which would be their
      cover story to investigate the place. It was only a few days after that
      when Shiki called from Reien and asked him to look up Hideo Hayama and
      Satsuki Kurogiri. Mikiya first heard about the dormitory fire in Reien in
      October last year, and it was from that point that he started developing
      the curiosity to look into it, but he’d only assembled any coherent set of
      documents from the thing today, which, combined with his fretting over his
      sister’s safety of course meant that he hadn’t really had a wink of sleep.
      “Well, I guess as long as she’s near Shiki, she’s relatively safe,” he
      says to himself as he stretches his arms out above him. So what should he
      do now, then? Sleep is starting to sound like a really good idea. And just
      as he thinks it might not be the right time for him to sleep when Azaka
      might call back at any moment, he finds his eyelids heavier than he had
      anticipated and quickly falls into deep slumber. *** A dream takes Mikiya
      back to a moment only a few days ago, after New Year. Shiki had shown him
      the uniform Azaka had expected her to wear going into Reien. Outraged at
      how ridiculous she thought it looked on herself, she dragged him along
      with her to complain to Tōko, who, upon seeing it, only said one thing.
      “Splendid.” Whatever was so splendid about it seemed to escape Mikiya, and
      obviously Shiki as well. She had made it a point never to show herself to
      him wearing that again until she left. “You’ll catch a cold sleeping on
      that desk, Kokutō.” “I’m awake!” Mikiya responds reflexively, instantly
      waking himself and looking around the room at who had just said that. He
      spots the wall clock first, though, which shows the time at three in the
      afternoon. As soon as the fact that he had just spent two hours sleeping
      on his own desk dawns on him, Mikiya suddenly feels much colder. It was
      his own fault to start sleeping here lacking any sort of heating at the
      height of winter. “Miss Tōko?” he says, finally laying his sleepy eyes on
      the woman walking across the room. “When did you get back?” Tōko Aozaki,
      still in her trench coat and with a cigarette pressed between her lips,
      stops beside Mikiya. “Just now,” she answers. Her long face looks like
      she’s starved for any kind of entertainment. It looks as if today’s date
      with cousin Daisuke ended on some note of failure. “You seem bored,
      ma’am.” Mikiya smiles, thinking he can get away with a few snide
      observations with Tōko looking the way she does. But her answer is
      contrary to what Mikiya is expecting. “No, not bored really. He was kind
      of dull, but I wasn’t bored by him or anything.” And that is the only
      assessment she gives of how the day went before reaching into her coat
      pocket and bringing out a can of coffee and placing it on top of Mikiya’s
      desk with a comment. “Little present I got you for watching the office.”
      An…economical present, Mikiya thinks, but one that he is nevertheless
      grateful for thanks to the coldness that took over his body while he
      slept. He manages a small thank you before he quickly breaks open the
      can’s tab. Tōko suddenly spots the thick stack of documents placed on top
      of Mikiya’s desk and grabs one of them while wearing an even more bored
      look on her face. “Oh, those are just some stuff Shiki asked me to look up
      about some of the faculty in Reien. I don’t think you’ll find it riveting
      literature.” “Probably not,” responds Tōko with a nod, but still she
      starts to flip through the pages. For a few seconds, she retains the
      uninterested look on her face, but stops right at the page with Satsuki
      Kurogiri’s photograph stapled to it. “Godword.” Her voice is a surprised
      whisper, and after she speaks that word, her mouth remains ajar enough to
      let the cigarette previously affixed to her mouth to fall to the floor.
      Her eyes suddenly open like she’s seen a ghost. “I can’t believe it,” she
      finally mutters. “The spell weaver that the Ordo Magi have run themselves
      ragged trying to hunt down is posing as a high school instructor, here?
      This must be some kind of joke for the Master of Babel.” She takes on the
      ragged smile of any person who knows that she stands to lose as much as
      she can gain, a smile lacking in scorn but with plenty of the potent
      mixture of dry caution and calculated risk of the next precipitous choice.
      “Satsuki Kurogiri? A mage?” Mikiya asks, incredulous. Tōko gives him a
      quick glance before going back to reading the document intently. Still
      wearing her madly unleashed grin, she takes her seat behind her own desk.
      “The Mother Superior didn’t bring along a photo with her request. Leaving
      this one to Azaka might have been a mistake. I could have…no. If I’d went,
      my memories would only have been stolen.” Not understanding what Tōko’s
      halting words mean, Mikiya can only shrug, concluding only that she
      referred to stolen memories as probably one of her more colorful and
      obscure metaphors. Still, from what he can gather, this man seems to have
      been more dangerous than Tōko had originally anticipated, and it inspires
      more questions from him. “If this guy is really a mage, then Shiki and
      Azaka have their necks on the line being so close to him. Miss Tōko, I
      need to know if he poses any danger to either of them.” “Not likely. If
      the rumors are true, Godword doesn’t plan on harming anyone, at least not
      intentionally. He is no mage, for one. He hails from no dynasty of magic,
      nor does his soul bear the lucky spark that animates the Arts of a few
      lucky individuals, such as Azaka. But just as Azaka can do no more than
      control the flames, his one particular gimmick is the command over
      language. It seems to be an ability outside of what is documented in the
      Arts of the magi dynasties, but he claimed it when he was but ten years of
      age. “My mastery of the arcana of the Runes at twenty years of age is
      often considered early, but there have been those who reached it earlier.
      One of those individuals, a man who studied in the Collegium of the
      African Atlas Mountains, I have not personally met, though all Collegium
      know his names and titles. The Master of Babel, Godword Mayday. The only
      weaver of an Art so potent and ancient, it borders on mythic sorcery.” She
      snickers, as though she was suddenly privy to some cosmic secret. Mikiya
      knows that she is spinning the words as much for herself as for him, and
      somehow, that makes it all the more unsettling. “No one truly knows what
      Godword’s real name is, and even those who knew him in his Collegium are
      limited. Few ever see him in person. But his face and magic are known to
      all who claim allegiance to the traditions of the London Ordo Magi. You
      see, Godword’s Art is fairly obvious to derive from his title: he speaks
      the high speech, the mythic Adamic language. The words still hold power
      over reality, and they tap a consciousness embedded in every human being,
      rendering it comprehensible by anyone. There is no word he does not know,
      no dialect he is not privy to. Though he hears himself as only speaking
      one single language, anyone who hears him hear it how their paradigm
      manipulates them to. Even you must know the story of the Tower of Babel,
      Kokutō.” “Yeah, the same thing that Pieter Brueghel painted, right? A
      tall, spiral tower almost reaching heaven, where they planned to build a
      temple on top so that God could talk to them easier. But God saw that as
      hubris and struck down the tower, and so men could never repeat the same
      thing, he created the confusion of tongues which scattered people all over
      the Earth.” “Indeed. The old Babel story from the Bible. Other extant
      sources point to similar stories, and there is always what they call the
      ‘confusion of tongues.’ God made to scatter humanity, but not through the
      complex physicality of skin or race, but through simple language. After
      all, the largest difference you notice between Japanese and foreigners
      isn’t the color of the hair or the eyes, but simply the constructions of
      our grammar and words, correct? It forms a continual barrier of
      understanding. The reasoning of God goes that because of this barrier,
      mankind will never again build such a towering edifice. But over time,
      mankind grew, and prospered, and globalized, and eventually, the barrier
      of language became somewhat lax. “What now for the confusion of tongues?
      Such a judgment was made in the time when humanity still felt their gods,
      in the mythic ages. This was a time when our mysteries were not yet
      mysteries, and the Art was the consensus, and therefore common, and when
      mighty sorcerers wielded great powers from the occult phases of the moon,
      and the jealous tides of stars, which made the world overflow with mana.
      So it was taught to us, at any rate. Godword is a constant reminder of
      this. Before the confusion of tongues, there was but one, formless, high
      speech, through which everyone understood all, and when men spoke to the
      anima mundi and its creatures as surely as they did each other. Then God
      gave us the debased tongues, stealing from us the promise of wisdom he had
      once so readily granted. Godword is the only known one able to reproduce
      this universal language, and work his Art through the high speech. He
      communicates to all men, a channel through which that demiurgic force,
      that ultimate origin passes through. That his lack of talent for magehood
      prevents him from truly using it dangerously is a blessing for us.” In
      contrast to Tōko’s sinister smile, Mikiya sports a troubled and confused
      look. He doesn’t know if he truly understands what Tōko is trying to say,
      seeing as she has forgotten, yet again, that he isn’t privy to the
      mystical aspects of her trade. Still, he knows enough to parse it in
      something that his mind can understand. “So in other words, Satsuki
      Kurogiri can speak to anything?” he asks. “Mostly. The universal language
      is not as universal as it once was, and though he can speak to a beast,
      and it will understand him, the beast cannot convey his thoughts in the
      same way. People will also return to him the language that they speak.”
      “So what’s so special about that? If they can’t talk back to him, isn’t he
      just kind of talking to himself?” “If the medium of words is used, yes.
      But the man is different. He speaks not truly to men and beast, but to the
      soul in them that still contains that last connection to something higher.
      There is always a part of us that is culled from that primeval spiral of
      origin, and when the high speech speaks to the soul, our fallen selves are
      compelled to obey. To deny it is to ontologically deny the very structure
      of reality, and thus impossible. An absolute language, that starts from
      statement and then proceeds to become truth. It is the ultimate form of
      hypnotism. He accesses the Akashic Record unconsciously, and through the
      high speech, taps into it to channel his will. It’s how he draws forth the
      memory, not from your mind, but from the Record of things past that
      reality still contains. Truly a spell worth the Academia Seal that’s been
      granted to him.” Tōko leans back heavily on her seat with a heavy sigh,
      and Mikiya wonders if she is finally satisfied. The Academia Seal. A mark
      of recognition and uniqueness that the Ordo gives to mages or spellworkers
      that have a talent so rare it hasn’t been seen before, or indeed, is not
      expected to be seen again. For the preservation of these abilities, they
      seek to contain these individuals. Though the Ordo considers it a high
      honor, the affected party hardly ever thinks so, since his use is now
      eternally as a subject of study. Mages trapped in this way have no more
      opportunity for study, no more time for the quest for ascension that
      defines every mage. Thus, most mages marked with the Academia Seal make
      haste to separate themselves from the Ordo, and Godword is one of a number
      of such apostates. If the Ordo knew about Godword being here, it would
      only be a short while before he is eventually caught. But Tōko Aozaki
      cannot resort to this measure. Will not. She had risked her independence
      and owed the Ordo after that incident with the Ōgawa Apartments in
      November, and she was not so keen to do the same thing again. She stares
      up at the ceiling blankly and thinks. As long as Godword is in Reien,
      Shiki and Azaka are always in some measure of danger. Still, Azaka was the
      one looking for a showdown, and she would never forgive Tōko for denying
      her this opportunity. “It’s the benches for us for now, Kokutō. I don’t
      think it’ll be anything serious anyway.” She declares with finality as she
      finally slips a new cigarette into her mouth and lights it. Mikiya looks
      at her with an eyebrow raised. “Are you sure? If I understand what you’re
      saying, which might not be in the realm of impossibility, Satsuki Kurogiri
      sounds fairly dangerous. You’re really not going there to help, ma’am?” “I
      already told you he’s not the one to harm anybody. His Art isn’t even
      polished enough for him to use it as any kind of attack. His isn’t the
      kind of Art that Shiki and Azaka cultivate. He can only make other
      people’s desires come to fruition. And he’s only here for that vaguely
      defined goal that he always seems to chase after.” “Which is?” The
      simplicity of Kokutō’s question makes Tōko think back on when she assigned
      this case to Azaka. The incident of forgotten memories, lost to oblivion,
      does indeed sound like the handiwork of Godword in retrospect. But what’s
      done is done. Who was to suspect that one of the Ordo’s best sport would
      be hiding himself in an academy in a backwater province? “It’s a goal
      that’s fairly simple, inconsequential even. It’s…well…I suppose you could
      call it eternity. As long as he has that power, he’ll always chase after
      shadows incomprehensible to us, but valuable to him. It’s like a
      bittersweet mirage to him, and the chase will last a lifetime and more.”
      She takes a long drag from her cigarette, and then breathes out the thick
      gray smoke. “He’ll never get it, though. Even though he can find eternity
      everywhere he looks.” The smoke from the cigarette wafts toward the
      ceiling, catching the light in a hazy pattern that tells of some
      obfuscated mirage.
