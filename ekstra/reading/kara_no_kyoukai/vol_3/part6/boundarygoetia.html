    <p>
      I need to beat someone up. I don’t care who it is, but I’d prefer it if it
      was somebody I wouldn’t feel any guilt over, and preferably done in a
      place where nobody can see me. For a fella, I’m pretty shy, and I don’t
      want this ending up with me expelled from school, at least not until I’m
      done. After thinking on it for a week, I know exactly who to hit and where
      to do it. It’s going to be a schoolmate of mine, a grade or two lower than
      me probably. The blond-dyed kid looked at me funny this one time when we
      passed the hallway. The place is going to be near an arcade he frequents.
      Thinks he’s a big shot over there, winning in video games, and letting
      loose with his fists at anyone who dares make him lose. He doesn’t do it
      inside, though. Usually pulls the poor sap into the back alley of the
      joint under the pretense of a friendly chat about the game in order to
      force his recompense out with his fists, obviously thinking he can wipe
      away his imagined disgrace by taking a swing or two at anyone. That
      location pretty much takes care of the problem of not being seen by
      anyone, and so no one is really able to call him out on his bullshit. All
      is good. Conditions are perfect. Weak people disgust me. I’d mustered up
      enough courage to face her and tell her one day, only for her to put me
      down with that one sentence as she left. Maybe she was right. I’ve never
      been in a fight—a physical one—once before in my entire life. I’ve just
      never had a fight escalate to that degree, or haven’t been brave enough to
      escalate it myself. In truth, that is probably why she had called me weak.
      So it follows that I probably need to beat someone up to get rid of that
      weakness. It is the swiftest proof of strength that I can think of, and
      since then I’ve planned and planned for the moment. Hitting someone as
      hard as I can is probably the last thing of importance I haven’t done in
      my seventeen years of being alive. And so, I began to draw the kid out. It
      was already night when I went to the arcade, and he was already there,
      like clockwork. I beat him in the same game, over and over again, for what
      must have been an hour. And when the time finally came for him to pull me
      outside, I followed him out of the store, slowly, almost hesitatingly.
      There is a show to this. A proper moment that appears only when he least
      expects it. So he gives me a wordless eyefuck as I step out, his height
      lending it an added effectiveness. This, in itself, is a development,
      since there’s usually some amount of cajoling involved. There are no words
      tonight. He leads me to the back alley as I follow with a feigned
      hesitation. Alright. Calm down. It’s almost a given that he’s going to try
      and hurt me tonight. Still, hurting him back gives me just a little bit of
      uncertainty. But even that is soon willed away. After all, if he’s really
      going to hurt me, no one can judge which is crime and which is punishment.
      He pulls me deep into the alley, the light from the street barely reaching
      us. “Hey,” I say dully, which causes him to look back over his shoulder. I
      take the small wooden club from behind my back, hidden under my shirt, and
      give his head as great a swing as I can give. A crack, and then a dull
      thud as the kid falls to the ground flat on his face like a ragdoll. A few
      moments later, blood starts to blossom from the wound on his head, flowing
      down his scalp and into the concrete alley, tainting the trash and
      discarded needles around his head. It only takes me a few seconds to
      conclude that he isn’t moving again anytime soon. “What?” I can’t believe
      it. I only whacked him once with the wooden club, but that was pretty much
      instant death wasn’t it? “What the fuck?” It is a genuine remark, provoked
      by the moment. I mean, look at it. It’s an accident is what it is. I
      didn’t intend to kill him! It isn’t murder, surely? “I never knew...”
      ...what? That humans were so fragile, and that they could die so simply
      and easily? But this is the sort of thing that these kinds of people
      always turn to, but why am I the one that ended up killing someone?
      They’ve always resorted to violence, but this is my first time! How can
      this be even remotely fair?! Am I just unlucky, or are these people just
      too lucky? Is there bad luck going around for everyone? I don’t know
      anymore. I don’t know. I don’t know! I don’t know anything about this
      mistake, or this state of affairs, or the question of whether this was a
      crime or not, or even the simple question of how to proceed further. But I
      do know one thing. The police will treat this as a murder, no matter how
      much I plead that this is an accident and no real sin. Soon, they’ll catch
      me. And that will be that. “No. I’ve never done anything wrong. It’d be
      wrong of them to just lock me away.” But still, the entire thing needs to
      be hidden. Thankfully, there aren’t any witnesses to take care of. All I
      need do is hide this corpse, and the normality of my everyday life can be
      restored. But where to hide it, and how? There’s not a single place you
      can stuff a body here without being seen. I could start a fire, but even
      that’s not foolproof these days. Not to mention it would start a commotion
      here that I most definitely do not want. Damn it all. If this were
      somewhere in the forest or the mountains, I could count on the animals to
      just eat all of it up— Just, you know...eat it, natural like. “Maybe
      eating it would do the trick?” Man, the answer is so simple, I can dance!
      I am such a genius tonight! Doing it that way means there’d be little of a
      corpse to be found. So then, the question is still “how?” There’s just too
      much meat. There’s no way I can eat all of that meat alone before morning
      comes. Then, maybe I should just start with the blood. Yeah, the blood. I
      lean down on the body, letting my lips wrap around the kid’s open wound,
      where blood continues to spill like water from a leaky plastic. I begin to
      suck, and the thick blood is sticky upon my lips and throat. But after a
      few seconds of it, I cough up all that I’d just drunk. Goddamn it. I
      didn’t even drink too much. Sticks to my damn throat and I can’t drink it
      easy like water. If I keep at it like this, I could block my breathing and
      die here just like him. Oh god, what should I do? Can’t eat the meat,
      can’t even drink the blood... My teeth are chattering as I think, and I
      can’t do anything except shiver here like a pathetic loon. I’ve killed
      someone. I can’t even hide the act. I’ve killed someone. This is the way
      my life ends. In chaos and confusion with no easy exit in sight. “Why do
      you not take your fill until the very end?” says a voice that comes upon
      me suddenly from behind. When I turn to see who owns it, I sight a man
      wearing a black coat, cloaklike in its immensity. The long umbral
      silhouette he casts inside the alley as he stands against the streetlight
      looks of a cruelly made body that not even his massive coat can hide. His
      eyes are gaunt and clouded, bearing the weight of an eternity. “Do
      arbitrary rules blind you still, keeping you tethered from your true
      nature?” he continues to ask, looking not at the bloodied corpse behind
      me, but only at me. “Rules?” I say in a whisper. Come to think of it, why
      didn’t I think anything was wrong with just thinking to eat the corpse? I
      didn’t even feel disgusted when I dared to drink the blood. What told me
      to put my lips on the worsening wound, but feel nothing about it? I tried
      to eat someone, which is probably a crime worse than murder by popular
      definitions. One need only look at the number of killers who also decide
      to cannibalize on their victims, and it’s obviously not a pretty high
      number. No, most people wouldn’t even think of it. Obviously because
      cannibalism is such a strange, alien act. “But I thought it was the
      natural thing to do,” I find myself saying inadvertently. “Indeed. This
      means you are special, for you to have chosen such a course of action
      after a murder. Most would have already run, confused and pathetic. But
      you faced your act in your own manner. Even if it is a manner that
      decidedly breaks from the consensus, it is an act from which you cannot be
      blamed for.” The man in the black coat takes a step inside the alley, a
      step toward me. Why do his words sound so sweet, almost making me forget
      that he is a witness to my crime? “Me? Special?” “Yes. Consensus has no
      hold over you. A reality of rules binds those who deviate, their acts
      called a sin by men of ignorance. But to the deviant, his is the most
      natural thing in the world. So where is evil in this equation?” He nears
      me, placing a hand on my head, and I do nothing to stop him. Deviants and
      lunatics and degenerates and fools. I am none of those clueless men. But
      still, if I am truly mad, there was nothing I could do about killing the
      kid, now was there? “I’m not normal...different,” I mumble. “You are. And
      if you are so broken as you claim, then you only stand to profit by
      breaking completely.” His voice digs deep inside my brain, my heart, and
      the rest of my body, ringing with the sound of some spellbinding sorcery.
      He is right. He had always been right. And when I take his words into me,
      my trembling and my fear for what comes after this are expunged, replaced
      with a joyous sensation, like I’ve gained a new lease on life. My vision
      turns white before me. My throat dries, and even breathing as hard as I
      can puts little air in my lungs. I feel like my body is being is burned by
      a pain travelling through all my veins and arteries, but it’s a glorious
      pain no drug can hope to match. The inscrutable, cruel-featured man holds
      my head in place with a hand that I know can crush me. And under those
      hands, I crumble to tears in a manner that has never happened in my life
      entire. The tears are warm, joy-made. The scream that wanted to exit my
      lungs speaks of some primal passion. This. This is the time and place
      where I break. The boy consumed the corpse in an hour. He used no tools
      save the power of his own teeth and jaw, devouring something much larger
      than himself wholly and completely. His tongue does not tell him the
      quality of it, of its succulence or otherwise. He finds value only in the
      physical exertion, the mastication of his subject. “An hour? You are
      excellent.” The black-coated man examines the boy’s handiwork thoroughly,
      bearing witness to all of it before speaking. The boy turns to him lazily,
      his mouth and face thick with red blood, both from his subject and from
      his own, borne from the breaking of his own chin, and the tearing of his
      own flesh, showing the fruit of the haste and difficulty of his act. He,
      however, does not seem to know that this has even happened. The boy tore
      into the corpse, never stopping for even a moment, leaving nothing except
      a few drops of blood in the darkened alley. “But that excellence will
      still define you,” the tall man continues. “Becoming aware of your origin
      by yourself will only take you so far. One must put the catalyst in the
      soul, awaken the vital spark.” The boy hears the man’s words, looking at
      him through now hollowed eyes. “You are still on the brink, that empty,
      hollow boundary. Henceforth, you shall be the man-eater, from now and
      until death. But you do not wish for it to end there. You will be a man
      not bound to the senses of the rabble, someone transcendent. A unique and
      new life must emerge. Do you not want to claim it?” The man’s words are
      spellbinding and lyrical. They engrave themselves directly into the boy’s
      now numb thoughts, pressing inside like a subliminal force of authority.
      Bathed in his and his victim’s blood, the boy nods sluggishly in assent,
      an act that can be compared to a prayer to his own god of salvation. “It
      is done. You shall be the first.” The man only needs to nod, and raise his
      right hand from its place over the boy for the bloody ritual to be
      concluded. The boy dares to ask him one question. “Who...who the hell are
      you, man?” The man in the black cloak remains motionless as he answers.
      His voice seems then to be powered by some demiurgic force, and through
      him that force speaks, resounding through the alleyway with the whispering
      of ages. “A mage. My name is Sōren Alaya.” At last, the man asks the boy’s
      true name. The boy tells him. And within his stonehearted face, the man
      finds it in himself to smile. “Leo. Regrettable. You lack one last step in
      being a lion.” There is a genuine melancholy in the words, even as he
      grins.
