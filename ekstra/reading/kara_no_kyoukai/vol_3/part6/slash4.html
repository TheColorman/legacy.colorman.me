    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - /4</h1>
    <p>
      Afternoon passed and the sun soon fell, far too early for what I’m usually
      used to. Students are already starting to return to their dormitories and
      rooms, as the daily Reien curfew of 6:00pm draws near. Having just eaten
      dinner in the dining hall, we make like some of the students and go back
      to Azaka’s room. Outside the window of her room, the sky is a blanket of
      star-filled night, and darkness envelops the entirety of the campus,
      pockets of light from windows and pathway lamps lighting up certain
      portions of it here and there. Nothing breaks the desolate silence except
      for the blow of the wind, and the rustle of trees swaying from its brush.
      If it weren’t for the whole boarding school system thing, this might have
      actually been a pretty nice place to go to school in. The high school I
      (sort of) go to in the middle of Tōkyō is infernally noisy at most times
      of the day. I enter the room ahead of Azaka, and sit myself down
      immediately on the inviting top bunk. Azaka makes sure to lock the door,
      and with a sway of her hair, she turns to face me with a troubled look on
      her face. “Shiki, you’re hiding something.” Now she has an index finger
      pointed squarely at me. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. And let’s
      be honest here, aren’t you not telling me something too?” “I’m talking
      about a physical object, you dunce. Just stop fussing about it and hand
      over the knife you stole back in the dining hall,” Azaka says with a
      frustrated but not entirely non-belligerent voice. Well, that’s a genuine
      surprise. I actually am carrying a bread knife, stolen straight from the
      dining hall and hidden right in my sleeve. Either that knife is too big or
      I’ve been slipping in my weapon hiding skills if even someone like Azaka
      noticed it. Well, I have been practicing too much with the sword I got
      last November, so maybe that’s why. “Oh c’mon, it hardly carries an edge,”
      I protest. It doesn’t seem to matter to Azaka, though, who closes to the
      foot of the bed. “No. I don’t care. That’s final. Anything you hold turns
      into a precision death weapon anyway. I won’t have any accidental deaths
      in Reien on my watch.” “You’re doing a pretty piss poor job of it
      considering there’s already been a murder in here.” “There is a difference
      between an accident and a murder, you know. Enough. Just hand over the
      knife. I don’t know how many times I have to / 4 • 57 repeat our objective
      here before it gets through your thick head.” “You’re a bigger idiot than
      I thought if you still think we’re getting away from here without a
      fight.” I show Azaka no intention to give up the knife, and she takes it
      as her cue to start making her way up to my bunk. I was serious about what
      I said to her. I didn’t steal the knife just for kicks. I told Azaka about
      me taking out one of the fairies, but I didn’t tell her that I got pricked
      by it too. I don’t know if that was enough for Misaya Ōji to have access
      to some of my memories, but I have no intention of letting it happen
      twice…and besides, the design on the knife is pretty good and elaborate,
      even for the school. If I could take it out of here, it would sit pretty
      beside the other knives. Azaka stops at the top of the ladder to my bunk.
      “You’re really not going to hand it over, Shiki?” “Have I ever told you
      how much of a persistent bull you are? Not your most attractive trait.
      It’s why Mikiya keeps breaking his promises to meet up with you and stuff.
      Like this New Year’s.” Azaka’s face scrunches up in a bundle of annoyance.
      Somehow, I think I might have hit a nerve. “Fine. I’ve been waiting to do
      this for a long time anyway.” Then she jumps on me with as much force as
      she can. The tackle forces me from my sitting position, and makes me fall
      down on the bed, Azaka on top of me. She wrestles and pushes me down with
      surprising force and starts reaching for the knife in my sleeve. The girl
      is a regular temper case. Almost like a wounded, cornered bear if you
      threaten her enough to get mad. Words aren’t nearly enough to make her
      back down from what she wants, so reluctantly, I take the knife out of my
      sleeve and hand it to her only to finish our ridiculous episode on top of
      the bed. As soon she gets the knife, she scrambles down from the top bunk
      and walks toward her desk, and I remain lying on top of the bed. “Fucking
      retard strength. You put a bruise in my arm, you know that? What the hell
      do they feed you here, steroids?” “Just a regular diet of bread and
      vegetables, thank you,” she says, her tone mocking. As she hides the knife
      inside her desk and checks again to make sure the door is locked, I pull
      myself up, returning to my previous sitting position and looking at
      Azaka’s back. It probably would have been fine if I’d ended it then and
      there, but I had to blurt out again. “I didn’t expect you to be that
      strong. Should be enough to push Mikiya down on the bed when you finally
      do it.” In an instant, Azaka’s face turns red. Well, I don’t actually know
      since she has her back turned to me, but her red ears aren’t painting a
      flattering picture. 58 • KINOKO NASU “Wh, wh, wha—” she stammers,
      swallowing her words. She turns around to look at me. I knew her face was
      red. “What the heck did you just say?” “Nothing. Nothing important to me
      at least.” She doesn’t rise to the bait. We stare at each other for a
      time, me and Azaka’s blushing red face. When it seems like we’ve heard the
      clock’s second hand tick for what must be the hundredth time, Azaka
      exhales a disappointed sigh and asks. “So you know?” She seems to hold her
      breath for the answer. “It wasn’t me that noticed it first, I can tell you
      that. No need to worry though. Mikiya doesn’t know a thing.” With great
      relief, Azaka lets go of her breath. It’s true what I said. I didn’t
      notice it first. It was Shiki that saw through Azaka the first time they
      met. And through him, came to know it as well. If he hadn’t been
      there, I don’t think even I would have known about it. She’s so guarded
      around Mikiya, and if he’s not around he hardly even talks about him or
      even so much as steers the conversation in a direction remotely close to
      her brother, except to talk about how bad an influence I am, and so forth.
      Refreshing herself and regaining her usual composure, she looks back at
      me. “Aren’t you mad at me, Shiki?” I don’t really get why I should be, but
      I’m not, and so shake my head. It only succeeds in making her look more
      confused. Wait, are we still talking about Mikiya? But he’s not my— —he’s
      not my what? I try to put the thing out of my mind, by just asking Azaka
      the first question that comes to mind. “You’re siblings, right? Why’re you
      into that sort of thing?” Unfortunately, it turns out to be the most
      landmine filled question I could spontaneously come up with. She doesn’t
      lose her cool, but she does allow her eyes to wander around the room as
      she thinks. “It’s because…I like being special. Or more accurately, I like
      things that are denied me, things that flirt with the taboo. Hence,
      Mikiya. He just doesn’t…he just can’t return what I feel, and maybe I’m
      happy being that way. I’m lucky, aren’t I? I’ll always be near the person
      I like.” Inside myself, I’m laughing. Not at her, but my unexpected but
      seemingly accurate observation that all the weirdos always seem to have a
      thing for Mikiya. “You’re sick.” “You’re one to talk!” The abruptness of
      both our replies does not escape the notice of either of us, and for a few
      seconds, we are silent. But then she smiles, and I smile / 4 • 59 as well.
      And in a wordless agreement, we decide to leave it at that and go to
      sleep. Azaka clearly has something to do to tomorrow relating to the
      investigation, since she seems to fall asleep only a minute after hitting
      the sack. My nocturnal habits are completely at odds with this school’s
      curfew though, so it’s much harder for me to just fall asleep when I feel
      like it. I stay awake for a long time, hearing the second hand on Azaka’s
      wall clock tick two hours away as I do nothing save for staring at the
      scenery outside the window opposite the bed. Now even the few precious
      lights that glowed faintly in the campus have all been snuffed out. Beyond
      the quad, there is only the deep darkness of Reien’s forest, where the
      light of the moon can’t seem to pierce through the canopy of foliage,
      whose earlier stirrings have now given way to the eerily thick and
      unbreakable silence. As quietly as I can make it, I reach inside my left
      sleeve. What Azaka doesn’t know is that I stole two knives from the dining
      hall. I draw it from my sleeve and take it out, holding it up above my
      head such that what little light from outside can strike off it. I was
      planning on using this one here, and the one Azaka got as a display item
      when I got home. I wish I wouldn’t have to sully this blade here, but I
      realize now that it’s a fool’s hope. “Everyone’s so busy tonight,” I
      whisper to myself when I return to looking at the forest outside, only to
      see numerous faint but wandering lights flitting around in the darkness of
      Reien like fireflies. There must be ten or twenty of them at least.
      Yesterday night I saw something similar, but only one or two, and I
      doubted they were anything except a figment of my imagination. Now there
      can be no doubt that they’re the fairies, and their activity tonight
      implies something suspicious. Must be because of what happened to Azaka
      this afternoon. Now, the mage who’s controlling all these fairies is
      forced to speed up her plans. “You’re gonna get a test drive soon enough,”
      I murmur as the blade glints in my hand, letting it catch the dull
      moonlight from the window. This will be the last night I spend in Reien,
      I’m sure. Whatever has to happen, it’s clear that it has to happen
      tomorrow.
