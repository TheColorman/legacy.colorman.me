    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - IX</h1>
    <p>
      I dreamed of a memory when, as a child, I still lived in the family house.
      I dreamed of the distant past. We had a neighbor then. An old man, whose
      family had all left him, alone in a little house all by himself. Dementia
      had long crept up on him, and even remembering the events of yesterday was
      a rare feat for him. Yet he was kindly, and warm towards us always. I
      always maintained a distance from him, but my brother Mikiya became very
      close to him. Perhaps the old man saw my brother as a way to forget the
      loneliness, if only for a while, by talking to a boy next door. They spent
      time talking about trivial things, but my brother would come home every
      time to tell me all about what he had said as if they were the most
      important things to him. But the day came. It was suppertime, and no one
      ever truly saw it coming. It was my brother that went over to the old
      man’s house that discovered him collapsed on the floor, unwaking, and told
      our parents. It was our parents that rushed to him, doing what they could,
      and it was them who shook their heads when we asked the questions that
      must be asked. We knew what it meant. The mood of the suppertime table
      strained and vanished quickly. And inexplicably, I found myself crying for
      him. He had endured ten long years without his family, only to pass away
      unthanked. Even I, who I had thought had already hardened her heart, had
      to shed tears for this man. And if even I was brought to tears, I thought
      how hard it must be for my brother. But he didn’t cry. His face betrayed
      only the faintest glimmers of sorrow, but he didn’t cry. I thought at
      first that he was feigning a strength that he didn’t truly have, even
      though it would be foolish of him to think that a display of such strength
      would win him any favors. Days passed, and not a single tear passed from
      Mikiya’s eyes. I found him sitting by the veranda at night, looking up at
      a bright full moon. I took a place beside him, and like him, looked up to
      see the countless stars. And I asked him. “Why aren’t you crying?” “Who
      knows,” he said. He looked down at me from his height with an awkward
      look. His eyes were pained but steady. “Is it because boys don’t cry?” I
      asked, repeating the words my father once said. But my brother only shook
      his head. “Why aren’t you crying?” I repeated. “I want to, but I
      shouldn’t. Because crying should be special.” Thinking the matter settled,
      he looked back up at the night sky. Even as I recall it now, his face then
      was the closest he came to crying, but in the end, he never did. He, more
      so than anyone, was close to that old man, and he, more so than anyone,
      deserved to cry. Because crying should be special. It casts a shadow over
      everyone who sees, letting feelings of sadness slip in easily to all who
      witness it. It is a contagion, an echo that worsens the grief. But it is
      still special, and private. That is why he doesn’t cry. More than anyone I
      know, he would never willingly hurt another, and he holds all the anger
      and grief he can carry inside him for the benefit of others. If he were to
      cry, it would be for someone truly special, someone truly personal. But
      for that understanding of others, he trades himself ever being understood
      by anyone. Nobody understands him for what he is. He must have been so
      lonely then. And it was at that singular point that Mikiya Kokutō became
      someone truly special to me. An important figure that I would struggle
      never to lose. It was a night when the moonlight played wildly off the
      glass, and wheneven the lights of the city could not hope to match it. And
      so, brother and sister turned skyward to see that blanket of stars. And
      that is the image I see every time. It is an old dream from a day that
      should be left long forgotten. January 11, Monday. Classes have begun
      again, and I’ve returned to the mundane student life. With my classes done
      for the day, I hurry back to the dormitory to prepare. Afterwards, I go
      the main office building to secure permission to exit the premises for the
      day. The sisters greet me with stern faces of disapproval, but they know
      I’ve never done anything to their disliking outside Reien, and so, as
      always, permission is granted. When I exit the main office, I manage to
      run into Fujino, spotting her by her distinctly fine raven hair first and
      foremost. “Going out again, Azaka?” she asks gently. “For a while. I might
      not make it for curfew this time, though, so can you tell Seo for me?” She
      nods, promising to tell the message to my roommate. Satisfied, we say
      goodbye to each other. Hurrying through the forest path with a quick step,
      I eventually reach Reien’s front entrance. The guard leaves the larger
      gate for cars to pass through unopened, instead opening the smaller side
      gate for me to use. As soon as I step outside the campus grounds, I see
      someone waiting for me who I know all too well. His wardrobe choice never
      changes: an all-black ensemble that makes him look like he just came from
      a funeral, though I’m glad to see that at least the coat he’s wearing is a
      light shade of brown. I allow myself a moment to calm my breathing and my
      voice before walking up to him. “Did I keep you waiting, Mikiya?” He leans
      his head forward a bit, looking at me over the top of his glasses, then
      points a finger at his reddened nose. “What do you think?” He smiles, and
      I can’t rightly tell whether it’s genuine or sarcastic. “So, we going?
      It’s only two hours before your curfew, so we’d best hurry.” He begins to
      walk, and I situate myself astride him, trying to lower my heart rate by a
      few beats. We walk parallel to Reien’s tall fortifications as we head to
      the nearby bus station. This whole event started when yesterday, out of
      the blue, Mikiya called me up. Apparently worried about leaving me high
      and dry during New Year’s for Shiki, he arranged this to make up for the
      entire incident. A little late to give you New Year’s money, I think. But
      hey, you’re a loaded girl anyway, right? he had said. It was just too
      funny to keep being angry at him, so for now, he’s forgiven. I told him
      that I didn’t need the money, and that maybe we should just go shopping
      instead. When he asked me what we would shop for, I couldn’t give him an
      answer. So I decided to sleep on it, and now here I am, walking beside
      him, still lacking an answer. “So, where are we heading today?” Mikiya
      asks. I cock my head to one side and stare at him in puzzlement. “For
      dinner, I mean. You want Japanese or a Western restaurant? I’ll treat
      you.” Again, I cock my head like a songbird. Does he…does he mean he’s
      taking me out on a date? “You couldn’t decide on anything yesterday,
      right? So I thought maybe taking you out to dinner would be okay.” I look
      up at him in astonishment. Did he say anything about this over the phone
      yesterday? I don’t think he did! “What, can’t even decide on a place to
      go? Fine, let me choose one for you. Don’t worry, it’ll be a place
      appropriate for the fine, upstanding young lady, and even the price isn’t
      gonna scare me off.” He beams at me. Does he really think that women are
      so easily swayed by meal offers? “I shouldn’t be asking. I guess he does,”
      I whisper under my breath. “What’s that?” asks Mikiya, but I choose to
      ignore him with a sigh. After all, even if I complained, he’d still
      probably take me there. I fell in love with him the same way, after all. I
      felt like it was the right thing—even the most natural thing—to fall in
      love with him, abandoning what I’d tried so hard to avoid. Not too hasty,
      I repeat to myself like a mantra, in as low a voice as I can. “You sure do
      like to whisper conspiratorially, Azaka. There anything wrong?” asks
      Mikiya. I shake my head in a negative. And for a moment, all the world
      feels lighter, and all the questions in my head seem lessened. “It’s
      nothing, really. Just swearing to myself not to screw up like some other
      girl I know in Reien.” I take his arm, wrap it around mine, and that is
      the farthest I can go before anyone starts to ask questions that lead to
      awkward explanations. With a slightly reddened face, Mikiya walks with a
      steady pace. I follow his lead, travelling to the sparkling, shining city
      where night is only beginning to fall. And so, my New Year’s outing
      finally starts, even though it is a bit late. And yes, I eventually do
      decide on some nice, extravagant Japanese food.
