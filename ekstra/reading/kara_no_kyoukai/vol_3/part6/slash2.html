    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - /2</h1>
    <p>
      After returning to the dormitory and subsequently talking to some of the
      students in class D, it had already grown dark outside. Though the school
      is on winter break, it apparently doesn’t stop the rules from being in
      effect, so we had to go back to Azaka’s room. After 6 in the evening,
      students are forbidden to go anywhere except the portions of the dormitory
      reserved for their class, except to go the bathroom, or to go to or from
      the study hall located on the first floor. The students who transferred
      here in high school who don’t know better sometimes sneak out to go to
      their friends’ room in other parts of the dormitory, and for that purpose
      some of the sisters keep a corridor watch in the night. The students
      who’ve been here since junior high are already used to it, and so either
      they don’t go out, or if they do, they already know the route that the
      nuns keep so well, and so are never seen. Or at least, that’s what Azaka
      has just politely told me. Since the entire thing is really of little
      concern to me, all I can do is sit in her room and grumble. Azaka is
      sitting in her own chair. The room we’re in is narrow but long, and first
      years get to share the room with another girl. Luckily for me, Azaka’s
      roommate went home for the winter. There are two study desks in the room,
      attached to the wall, and a bunk bed for the both of us. Personal effects
      go in the bookshelves and cabinets beside the wall. The room itself is
      obviously as old as the building it’s in, but it’s the kind of antiquity
      where you can feel the comforting weight of a placid history on it. Azaka
      is already in her pajamas, having changed immediately out of her uniform
      robes the minute we got back to her room. I wanted to change out of this
      stuffy nun uniform as well, but I didn’t bring any change of clothes, so
      it looks like I’m stuck with all the robes Azaka’s got. Having little else
      to do, I sit down on the bed and listen to Azaka’s explanation. “Seeing as
      we can’t go out of our rooms tonight,” she continues, “we’ll have to call
      it a day. Normally, we’d wake up at five o’ clock for morning service, but
      since it’s winter break, we can sleep in until six. Remember, Shiki, that
      none of the other students or sisters know we’re investigating the
      incident in class D, so please try to refrain from being too weird and
      bring attention on ourselves. Unlike you, I’m actually staying here for a
      second year, so please try not to make a big fuss that will mess up my
      reputation.” All of which I heard almost word for word the night before as
      well. I honestly have no idea why she even needs to worry. In some kind of
      inverse relationship, I’m so bored here that it makes me not want to do
      anything. “Relax. I’m just here to be your eyes, so I didn’t bring my
      favorite knife with me. I don’t have a grudge against whoever this fairy
      mage is, so I don’t have any special urge to take care of him. I’m more
      worried about your temper running wild and chasing after this guy.” “A
      misplaced fear, as well. I know our objective is only to identify the
      source of the phenomenon, not eliminate it. Investigate, and then pass the
      matter on to Miss Tōko, and have her take care of it.” So she says with
      her signature voice of calm, but the familiar fire in her eyes hasn’t died
      down since this afternoon. She’s taking that fairy incident really
      personal. And when that happens, I know she sees little option except to
      strike back. “Well, see if you can keep your attitude that way, Azaka,” I
      say offhandedly, which prompts Azaka to direct her stare at me. “Could it
      be that you’re making a fool out of me, Shiki?” “Like you said: a
      misplaced fear.” Her accusatory glance is so alike to how Mikiya looks at
      me in mock suspicion (which is more than uncommon) that it makes me
      inadvertently laugh. This only has the effect of worsening Azaka’s mood.
      “Ugh, fine. I swear that I won’t get mad, so you don’t have any right to
      judge me. Now to get back to more important matters,” she says as she
      changes the tone of her voice. “Among the people we met today, was there
      anyone you thought was strange in any way?” “Strange? Well, all of them,
      to be honest. All of the people from class D that we met had some of the
      stuff somewhere in their neck.” “By ‘stuff,’ I assume you mean the same
      blood that came from the fairy you supposedly killed.” Her brows come
      together in a frown, as she must think that I’m the worst person alive for
      crushing a perfectly good (and more importantly for her, studyable)
      familiar. Still, it’s the truth, so I can’t argue with her on that. “It’s
      not blood, I think. More like the scales on butterfly wings. I doubt they
      wouldn’t notice it if it was just some kind of liquid. It was in that
      teacher we met earlier, too. Kurogiri, right? I didn’t know what it was
      when we met him, but now that I think about it, it’s the same thing.” “I
      see. Say, Shiki, whoever’s responsible for this, why do you think he’s
      taking away the memories?” “Wouldn’t know. I don’t have any reason to do
      it.” “I don’t even know why I even bothered asking you,” Azaka says with a
      huff. Then, ignoring me, she starts to enumerate the facts we have at hand
      in as low a voice as she can muster. “In December, members of class D got
      a letter, containing secrets that even the person who knew them forgot
      about. At around the same time, rumors of fairies in the campus started to
      spread, sneaking up on you while you were asleep and stealing your
      memories. Just before winter break started, two students from class D
      argued and then attempted to harm each other with box cutters, the cause
      of their quarrel being the letters they received. The other students
      didn’t even try to stop the fight. Even up to January, the students refuse
      to talk about the incident, and the atmosphere remains very strained and
      unhelpful.” She grants me a sideways glance with dagger eyes for a moment,
      and then goes back to her reverie. “Well, she actually encountered at
      least one of the fairies, and I lost an entire hour to the creatures. What
      was I doing? I could have been doing all sorts of things in that lost
      hour.” So even the calm and composed Azaka Kokutō is bothered about
      memories forgotten. So what of me? My memories of what happened three
      years ago, during my freshman year of high school, still contain many
      blanks. The ambiguity of their nature still creates a great unease in me,
      filling my imagination with all kinds of doubts, all kinds of
      explanations, none of them painting me in the best light. That same year,
      the city seemed to have been frozen in place from the violent murders
      committed by an unknown serial killer. The gap in my memories almost makes
      me feel like…I’m connected to those incidents in some way. But if anyone
      would know, it would be Shiki, my other self. But now he’s gone, and
      whatever elucidating information he may have had is gone along with him.
      Wait—wait a minute. Why haven’t I thought of it before? If the holes in my
      memory is due to Shiki dying…then why are my memories relating to the
      moments directly before my accident also gone? Surely it wasn’t Shiki in
      control then, but . Maybe—maybe if this fae mage has a way of stealing
      memory, then could he have a way to give lost memory back? In any case, it
      would be difficult to get the idea past Azaka. And even discounting
      whether or not Azaka believes in them, the existence of fairies here isn’t
      something I particularly approve of. Whatever the situation evolves into,
      we still need to find the man responsible. And whatever fact me and Azaka
      are missing to tie everything together is so close that I can almost feel
      it through the walls, bleeding through the serenity in this enclosed space
      of madness. “Azaka, have you given a thought as to how we’re even going to
      begin to investigate lost memories?” “I know, I know. It’s not like we can
      hypnotize people and dig into their subconscious or something. Do you know
      anything about the four processes of memory, Shiki?” “Encoding, storage,
      retrieval, and recognition, right? Same as any VCR. Recorded video sticks
      to the tape and encoded and stored. When you watch it again, you put it in
      the box and it retrieves the video. You verify if it’s still the same
      video as before with recognition. If one of the processes fail, there’s
      some kind of a memory disorder.” “Indeed. Even if someone forgets
      something, the memory itself is still stored in the brain. Anything the
      brain encodes stays there. This isn’t some kind of weird mass hysteria.
      These so-called fairies are extracting these memories, but to what
      purpose, it isn’t clear.” Before I left, Tōko confided in me that she
      suspected that there was some cold intent behind all of this, but I can’t
      say I entirely agree. Seeing as the memories being stolen are memories the
      persons themselves have already forgotten, the person wouldn’t even notice
      if they were taken away. In fact, the whole thing with the letters seems
      almost a benevolent act, as if whoever was sending them was informing the
      person that he or she had forgotten this particular memory, and that they
      shouldn’t forget it ever again. “It’s possible the culprit is looking for
      something in all the memories. Some information, some kind of proof that
      he needs,” I suggest. Azaka acknowledges me with a slight nod and leans
      back on her seat. “Or just someone that really likes to tell people about
      the skeletons in their closet and point them out for everyone to see.” “If
      anything, it’s not something so benign. Harassment, at the very least.
      Like a kid, this one,” I add. Well, fairies are already like children in
      their fickleness anyway, so why do I even wonder? I try to stop myself
      from thinking any more on this. After all, I’m just Azaka’s eyes right
      now, and it’s her job to take the arcane knowledge and derive some kind of
      an answer to all of it, not mine. And with that thought, I move from
      sitting down on the bed to lying down on it spread eagled. “Tell me
      something, Shiki,” Azaka suddenly blurts out, seemingly embarrassed as she
      sits lazily in her chair. “How is it that you see the fairies?” Man, she’s
      still beating herself up over that? “Don’t really know how I do it. Even I
      don’t know how the mystic sight works. All I know is that you don’t have
      it. But if you want to try and sense them, what you could do is improvise
      on the spells you can do, and the kind of Art you can control: find the
      moving currents in the air that you feel are warmer. If your senses are
      right, then you can catch them.” “Warm pockets of air, huh?” She nods and
      puts a hand on her chin as she thinks. It might sound like a load of
      bullshit, but I didn’t lie to her. If the fairies are alive, then they
      must give off heat, and that’s where Azaka excels. All she needs to do is
      find the small nooks warmer than others as soon as she knows that fairies
      are about. That would be the fairies trying to maneuver in the space
      around her. In any case, we conclude our planning after that. In a stroke
      of unexpected generosity, Azaka lends me one of her pajamas, just a bit
      larger than what I’m used to, and I take the top bunk and go to sleep.
