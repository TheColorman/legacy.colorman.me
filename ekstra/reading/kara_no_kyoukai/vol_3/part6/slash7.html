    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - /7</h1>
    <p>
      The mage was right. You can’t die just with a word. But people do die
      someday. Entropy demands that we die, disappear, and be forgotten.
      Otherwise, the boundary between past and future will be empty and
      meaningless. Reversing entropy takes a kind of energy we don’t have, and
      so things gain value in their temporality. But things can still lie
      eternal. Even if something is gone and forgotten, the fact of its
      existence didn’t change. It dwells in the mind, always with you, residing
      in its dark corners, awaiting only the right trigger to return. Which is
      why the more I think about it, the mage trying to derive eternity from the
      oblivion of memories seems to my perspective, like wasted effort. Things
      left forgotten are never truly gone, and somewhere in you is the truth…or
      what passes for the truth. That was already the kind of eternity he was
      looking for, wasn’t it? Now I know why Shiki made me forget the important
      memories from three and four years ago. He knew they were just there
      inside of me, perfectly asleep. And even if I can’t remember them, they
      are still there. That mage knew that, but still couldn’t accept it, still
      couldn’t see how that forgotten state could somehow be a good thing. The
      only thing he wanted was to pursue his misguided philosophy. In the end,
      the eternity that was as strong as his words came to be a reckless and
      worthless goal. The morning of January 7 eventually comes, and I am glad
      that this marks the official day where I take off the ridiculously
      restrictive uniforms of Reien. Sadly, Azaka gets to stay in school for now
      while I go outside, living the life of a free woman once again. I crumple
      the fake transfer request form up and throw it in the waste bin like some
      kind of old cleansing ritual. Azaka’s word to the Mother Superior should
      take care of everything else. Happily wearing my leather jacket again on
      top of the blue kimono Akitaka sent for me, I head to the front gate,
      ready to leave behind this strange world of forest and stone. But as soon
      as I step outside the front gates, I see someone waiting for me who I know
      all too well. “So you’ve got nothing better to do than to wait for me to
      get out of here?” I ask. “A vacation day from Miss Tōko and her
      generosity. It’s not gonna be like this all the time, you know.” He
      shrugs. He does it exactly the same way. A shrug that makes it look like
      what just happened was your fault. I remem/ 7 • 117 ber it with even more
      conviction now too, as I do the biting cold. And it only reminds me that I
      hadn’t wanted to see Mikiya today. I carry old memories now. Awkward ones.
      Maybe dangerous ones. And being next to Mikiya while I haven’t had time to
      have even thought properly on it only makes me more at unease. But maybe
      seeing his face might be better than still being afraid of the entire
      thing. Maybe. “Then how’s about we start our day with a good old waste of
      time?” I suggest sarcastically. “I’ve got an amazingly worthless fairy
      tale to spin for you, and I’ll let you hear it.” I start to walk down the
      road parallel Reien’s walls, and Mikiya easily keeps up, like we have been
      doing for the longest time. “Well, you’re in a good mood today,” he says
      as he looks at me straight in the face. But my eyes dart downwards almost
      instinctively, and I try my best not to let him notice it. I don’t know if
      it worked. In the time it takes for us to ride back to the downtown area,
      I finish telling Mikiya the whole deal about Satsuki Kurogiri and Misaya
      Ōji. We walk for a while amongst the familiar streets and buildings, not
      going back to our apartments, but instead somehow settling on an unspoken
      agreement to head to Tōko’s office. “So mostly everyone in the school had
      some kind of memory drawn out from them by Satsuki Kurogiri, right?”
      Mikiya muses with an expression of comprehension on his face. “But it was
      Misaya Ōji that wanted class D to suffer the most, hence the letters. The
      other students had their secrets revealed to themselves, but not to the
      other people that would stand to be affected by them.” “Yeah, yeah, that I
      know. The real question here is how come it was only Misaya Ōji’s stupid
      wish that resulted in the real chaos in the school?” “Right. She had to
      have been special in some way for Satsuki Kurogiri to go the extra mile
      for her. He only drew memories and revealed them to other students. But
      for Misaya Ōji, he actually gave her the means to act on her own.” His
      observation is correct, now that I think about it. Satsuki Kurogiri was a
      mirror reflecting the desires of the students, but this wasn’t so true for
      Misaya Ōji. “But why?” I whisper. Mikiya either didn’t hear me, or chooses
      not to answer. We walk in silence like that for a while, with me still
      refusing to meet his gaze directly. The stroll is made just a little bit
      uncomfortable by the cold air. It’s the kind of cold that really gets
      under your skin, no matter 118 • KINOKO NASU how much clothing you’re
      packing. After a few more wordless blocks have been passed, Mikiya turns
      to me, brow furrowed and with half of a frown formed in his mouth. “Shiki,
      the truth is that Satsuki Kurogiri really did have a sister.” He says
      nothing more, and the reasons for him saying so he leaves only to
      speculation. Whether Ōji was really his sister or not, only Satsuki
      Kurogiri knows. And the irony is that, if what he told me about how his
      silly parody of a “memory” works, the man himself wouldn’t even know.
      Whatever the truth was, it’d be lost forever. Hah, again with this
      “forever” business. “It’s definitely a weird story. I kind of feel bad for
      Satsuki Kurogiri, you know?” I think I have to qualify that there was no
      lie in me saying that. His situation with memory and feeling does, after
      all, resemble a certain girl’s situation only a few months ago. Mikiya,
      however, fails to recognize this, and only blinks his eyes in astonishment
      at what I just said. “Huh. Even though he supposedly attacked you? Actual
      sympathy from Shiki Ryōgi. Color me surprised.” “I’m not defending what he
      did specifically, you dunce. It’s just that I…understand why he was so
      desperate, I guess.” After all, how could I begrudge him and his actions?
      I can’t fool myself. Those long walks at night, travelling to dark alleys
      and narrow streets; I know what I was really after then, and it was
      something altogether worse than just messing with people’s memories. “And
      besides,” I continue, “the guy’s kinda like you.” “Can’t say I see how
      that could be.” “Oh c’mon, if you read your name differently, it would be
      Kurogiri1 too, wouldn’t it?” Mikiya chuckles. “Glad to see that your wits
      are still intact after being in that place.” “Just a dead language joke,”
      I say, as Mikiya looks at me sideways, perplexed at what I just said. When
      I catch a glimpse of his face, I can’t prevent myself from laughing a
      little. “What’s wrong now?” he demands. “Nothing, man. Was just
      entertaining the thought of me killing you, seeing as I didn’t get to kill
      anybody back there.” I laugh again, and Mikiya can only shake his head. I
      really can’t blame him. It is, after all, a very strange pair of sentences
      I just said. “Don’t mind me,” I quickly add. “Just thinking out loud, is
      all. And my thoughts tend to sound a bit less obvious to me when I
      actually say them.” 1 Mikiya’s surname of “Kokutō,” can be read
      alternatively as Kuro (黒) giri (桐), the same way Satsuki’s surname is
      read, but with different characters (玄霧, Kurogiri). / 7 • 119 On account
      of thoughts put into words, when meaning is lost and it becomes a mere
      sound. When the mage Satsuki Kurogiri stayed a child, and grew as one, he
      too lost the meaning of being an adult, thinking that pure mimesis would
      be enough. “If you say so,” Mikiya says with a shrug. “Besides, I’ve never
      hurt anyone, let alone killed someone, so don’t expect me to relate.”
      Sometimes, this guy can be such an idiot. But at least he’s the bearable
      sort of idiot. Having laughed off the last traces of my anxiety over the
      returned memories, at least for the moment, I continue to walk beside him,
      letting a smile rest on my face as I do. Before the both of us can notice,
      night has fallen, and the moon, seemingly frozen in place, floats with the
      stars overhead. In another unspoken agreement, we decide to forgo our
      visit to Tōko’s office, passing through it only on our way to continue our
      stroll, past unknown streets and winding alleys, through the dark
      circulatory system of the city. In the idleness of our walk and in the
      midst of our steady breaths, I find the willingness to finally meet his
      glance. He might be an idiot, but I’m glad to be with him right now. The
      reason, such as it is, is simple when I think about it. This is, after
      all, the first time that I went out at night for a stroll with a
      companion.
