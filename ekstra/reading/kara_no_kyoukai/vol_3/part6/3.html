    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - III</h1>
    <p>
      January 5, Tuesday. Shiki refused to wake up despite me spending the
      better part of thirty minutes trying my best efforts to do so. Either
      she’s an amazingly sound sleeper, or is actually awake and just lazy.
      Either way, I gave up on her, and at just past seven o’ clock, I decided
      to just head to the study hall on the first floor by myself. Normally, the
      study hall is populated by the same students (of which I am one of their
      number, of course) occupying the same spaces, dutifully studying for
      exams, but the break has cleared the room of most of its usual
      semi-residents. What the hall was built for and what most students
      actually use it for can be wildly different at times: at the same time
      that studious individuals are perusing books, others are conversing behind
      shelves, keeping a constant lookout for the patrolling sister Einbach,
      lest she unleash the customary disciplinary lectures when she discovers
      students misbehaving. The ease of using the shelves as concealment isn’t
      lost on me, and so I know that over the break it becomes one of the best
      places for any sort of clandestine meeting, especially so in mornings like
      these, when it sees little activity, and even less so on breaks. Seeking
      to exploit that fact, I arranged a meeting with class D’s president here.
      Yesterday, when me and Shiki asked a few questions to a few of the
      students from the class, they were fairly uncooperative, and all of them
      spouted the same suspiciously similar lines. We couldn’t get anything of
      value out of them. Well, it’s not as if I expected them to open up to
      people they perceive to be outsiders like us. So I saw little choice
      except to be a bit more direct, and I saw the best option for that was to
      make our position clear and talk to the class president, one Fumio Konno.
      All seems as expected when I finally arrive at the study hall, with no one
      in sight. No stove for heating can be found here, because the hall is too
      large, and so entering the hall, I am caught off guard by the winter chill
      running through the spacious room, colder than it is anywhere else in the
      building. “Kokutō, over here,” says a cool voice from deeper inside the
      hall. It is only a whisper, but the loneliness of the hall seems almost to
      amplify it. I can see rows upon rows of shelves inside, and between two of
      them, I can see Fumio Konno leaning out her head, waiting for me. Quickly,
      I close the door and head further inside. I share only one thing in common
      with Fumio Konno: the fact that we transferred into Reien Girl’s Academy’s
      high school in the same year. Other than that, we couldn’t be further
      apart. Her height easily surpasses five and a half feet, marking her as
      one of the tallest in the school, while my height is quite average. Where
      she is forceful and exuberant, I am composed. Where her hair is cut quite
      short, mine is grown out long. She looks almost an adult, and could
      probably pass herself off as a college student at least, and she herself
      acknowledges that she doesn’t truly act like the kind of girl that Reien
      tries to engender. “I’m quite sorry for having to meet you so early in the
      morning,” I say to Konno as I near the shelves she’s hiding between. I bow
      to her to acknowledge that this is the first time we’ve met, but she is
      evidently surprised by this courtesy enough to cross her arms as she draws
      a nervous breath, averting her eyes from me in the short moments it takes
      me to bow. “Er, forget about it. I can’t sleep easy with the girls in my
      class anyway. Keeping myself occupied through other things seems like the
      right thing to do at this point. So, what was it that was so important for
      you to talk about? Is it about Hayama?” Well, that was certainly
      straightforward, and it catches me off guard. “Excuse me?” “Oh, yeah,” she
      says with a snicker. “I sort of heard you were asking around with the
      people in my class yesterday, and some looker no one recognized was
      tagging along with you. Besides, what else would be so important to the
      president of class A to ask me about personally?” She ends with a slightly
      suspicious glance at my direction. As I’d feared, word of our activities
      is spreading faster than anticipated. I glance back at Konno, trying to
      dispel her little fear. “I never really thought much of Mr. Hayama at
      first, but I suppose that was a mistake on my part. I’ll be frank with you
      Ms. Konno. I’ve been tasked by the Mother Superior to investigate the
      incident that happened in class D. I need you to tell me if you know
      anything.” Unexpectedly, the tall girl’s face darkens at my inquiry.
      “Straight from the Mother Superior, huh? I guess honors students are
      different. And they just told me to keep forgetting about the incident and
      focus on studying. Wow.” “Keep forgetting. So that means—” “Pretty much.
      I’m in the same boat as Mr. Kurogiri. I was at the scene, unable to do
      anything. Then, nothing, Beyond knowing that the thing happened, I can’t
      remember anything. Then, I remember Kashima and Ruridō being transported
      to the infirmary somehow. I tried to visit them in the infirmary, but the
      Mother Superior forbade it when she was interviewing them.” Sweat starts
      to glisten from her forehead, and she seems almost embarrassed to even be
      speaking at all. That only goads me to press further and ask. “I have a
      wild theory here but—did you get a letter too?” “Oh, that. It wasn’t as
      creepy as the kind the other two got. It was pretty benign, comparatively.
      A lot of us got it every day, including Kashima and Ruridō. That’s got to
      drive you up the wall, doesn’t it? Mine just had stuff about walking home
      together with an old junior high crush, or my pet cat that died a long
      time ago. At first, I thought it was pretty useless. But then I almost
      started to like the letters. They made me remember things I almost forgot
      about. That whoever was sending them still knew about it was kind of scary
      and all, but to be honest, it didn’t seem to register all that much with
      me.” “Did you ever feel guilty about what he was sending you?” “I dunno.
      Maybe I did, and I just didn’t know what to call it.” “This might be a
      long shot but, do you know who sent the letters, or know anyone who
      would?” “No one I know. But this is hardly a normal situation anymore is
      it? If we’re assuming that things like ghosts or fairies exist, then
      surely there must be some…thing that knows.” She fails to specify what she
      thinks, however, so I try to change tack. “So personally, what do you
      think about what happened, Miss Konno?” “I don’t know what to think
      anymore. It’s weird, that’s for sure, but my class has always been weird
      from the start. Maybe it’s some kind of karmic thing, y’know? Maybe you
      don’t know about class D, Kokutō, but they’re all actually high school
      transferees. A lot of the parents think they’re problem children, so they
      dump them here. Me included.” Even I know about Fumio Konno’s reason for
      being here. She was a star basketball player in her high school once, but
      her dad wanted her only daughter to follow in the family enterprise. When
      she rebelled, her father put her into Reien by force to discipline her,
      and that was the end of that. I didn’t realize it’s a fate she shares with
      the rest of her class. “What can you tell me about Mr. Hayama setting fire
      to the dormitory?” I ask. This is the most important card I can play. The
      sisters forbade us from talking about it on pain of expulsion, and it shut
      the girls up quite effectively. Hopefully, the trust Fumio Konno shows in
      me can lead to something fresh. Her face turns bitter and she looks away
      as I ask the question. “I have no idea what he was thinking, burning the
      dormitory down. Hideo Hayama was unhinged. Behind the closed doors of our
      class he was fond of going on and on, complaining about why his brother
      didn’t let him just—” a pause, and a gulp “—fuck the Mother Superior. I
      dunno. Maybe you don’t believe me. But as far as I’m concerned, he had no
      business being an instructor.” Her voice starts to break, becoming
      halting. “And Kaori even died because of him! All because his brother took
      pity on him and gave the jobless fool a responsibility! Our class…we
      didn’t have anything to do with it. We weren’t responsible!” She spits out
      the words louder than she probably should have, and they echo across the
      empty study hall, giving me a moment of alarm before I remember that the
      hall is empty. I peek my head out of the shelves just to make sure, and
      quickly return to Fumio Konno, only a few moments ago looking cheerful and
      confident, now reduced to hiding her face from me, obviously holding back
      her sobs. I’d try to press further about what she means with her eerie
      last statement, but I realize I can’t get anything more out of her at this
      state, not now at least. “I’m sorry, Ms. Konno,” I stammer awkwardly. “I
      really am. If it’s any consolation, you’ve been very helpful. Let’s leave
      it at that for now. Do you need help getting back?” “No,” she quickly
      says, her voice muffled by a hand over her mouth. “Just leave me here for
      a while.” I turn my back on her hesitantly and start to walk out of the
      shelves worriedly. Just before I turn the corner however, I try to ask her
      one last question. “Do you believe in the fairies?” I almost regret the
      throwaway manner with which I state it, but Konno looks up at me with a
      measure of surprise in her eyes. “I don’t, but that doesn’t mean they
      don’t exist, right? I mean, how else can you explain the memories being
      like they are in our class?” I sigh in agreement, and leaving her, I make
      a beeline straight out of the study hall. After parting with Fumio Konno,
      I try to socialize with the few members of class D I happen to run into in
      the halls, but the responses are expectedly the same as before. In fact,
      there are much less of them wandering the halls now, as if they’ve started
      to hide themselves in their rooms to reduce their contact with the outside
      world as much as possible, like they were waiting for something. The few
      class D students I encounter all shared the same desire of wanting to go
      home, whispered in tones of cold disappointment. When I asked them why
      they don’t, in fact, go home, they only give me a very confused look. I
      already knew I couldn’t get a proper conversation out of anyone except
      Fumio Konno, being the class president weighted with responsibilities that
      she needed to get off her chest. The only thing I can gather is that all
      of them certainly believe in the rumors of fairies sweeping away the
      memories. Everyone did indeed receive the mysterious letters, and like Mr.
      Kurogiri, everyone had gaps in their memories. The conclusion I can derive
      is that all of the girls of class D are hiding something. What that may
      be, I can’t say, but it’s almost certain that Hideo Hayama was embroiled
      in the very center of it. With few other options, I make my way to the
      faculty room. Hideo Hayama might have left the school in November after
      the fire, but I’m hoping there might still be something in his files I can
      uncover. “Excuse me,” I whisper to no one in particular as I open the door
      to the empty faculty room. I know it’s empty at this time since the
      instructors rarely use it except for the morning meeting they have, and
      the office’s custodian is out on vacation as well. “Thank you, Lord,” I
      whisper with a smile on my face, half in my luck, and half in actual
      benediction. It doesn’t take me long to find the file on November last
      year, and I take my time poring over its contents. I hardly realize that
      an hour has passed while I’m flipping over files and opening folders in
      the unlit room, my sight only helped by the sunlight peeking through the
      windows. Despite my best hopes though, I can’t find anything of great
      importance to my investigation. “Darn. Looks like I’ll really have to use
      Shiki and search every nook and cranny of this school for a clue.” I don’t
      really want to have her follow me around like some kind of obedient
      Doberman, but it seems I have little choice. With nothing else to do, I
      close the file, now a bit messier than when I opened it. But one of the
      papers catches my eye. “Hideo Hayama, employed since 1989, employment
      termination at December 1998.” At first glance, it seems typical enough.
      But a cursory inspection reveals some very strange details. December 1998?
      That seems impossible when the fire happened in the beginning of November,
      and they haven’t heard a word or seen nary a peek from Hideo Hayama since.
      But according to this he was employed until December. And below that, the
      reason for termination is listed as “no known permanent address.” Does
      that mean he’s missing? The thoughts roil in my mind as I return the file
      where I found it and quickly slip out of the faculty room and back into
      the corridor… …only to meet the person I least expected—nor least
      desired—to meet. “Oh, Miss Kokutō. What business do you have in the
      faculty room so early, pray tell?” “G—good morning, Mr. Kurogiri.” I give
      a quick bow. “It’s already noon, though.” I try to dodge the question at
      the same time as I try to dodge past him without seeming in too much of a
      hurry. Yesterday, with Shiki beside me, I allowed myself to feel at least
      a bit less disquieted by him as I do regularly, but alone, the unease
      returns. My chest tightens, and my heart races. I can’t tell anymore
      whether the unease comes from the fact that he looks so like Mikiya, or
      it’s simply the nervously calm air with which he carries himself. “Were
      you retrieving something from the faculty room?” Despite my careless
      question, he answers. “Ah, yes. Something the Mother Superior asked me to
      do. A list of the students’ names, rendered in French. She needs to send
      it to the sister institution in France.” “I see. Our names, is it?” I
      stammer clumsily. I try to slip past him to end the conversation there.
      “Indeed. You are not entirely unrelated to the matter either. The short
      list for exchange student candidates for our French sister school includes
      you and Ōji.” That stops me in my tracks before I manage to make my way
      past him. This is the first time I’ve heard of this. I take a moment to
      relish that fact before continuing my steps. But I stop again when I pass
      him to ask him the question I’ve asked the students, but haven’t yet asked
      him. “Mr. Kurogiri, are you aware of the rumor circling amongst the
      students these days?” “The fae, correct? Yes, I’ve heard of them.” “Do you
      believe it, sir? Oh, but of course I don’t believe in them myself,” I
      quickly add. Unexpectedly, he smiles a lazy smile. “I think I understand
      your confusion. Stories of the fae aren’t as numerous here in Japan as
      they are in my country, are they? I think I find I have an affinity for
      the old Scottish tales of the cait sith, the cu sith, and other
      fantastical creatures.” I’m surprised for a few moments at his response,
      and it takes me some precious few moments more to remember that Mr.
      Kurogiri was, in fact, a foreigner. The university he studied in might
      have had something as esoteric as folkloristics, so my question might not
      have seemed so childish as I had originally assumed. “If I remember
      correctly, the cait sith is the cat that wears long boots.” “Oho, so you
      know. Still, talking cats find some commonality in some Japanese folk
      tales as well, so it’s not something so original.” Hah, well at least he
      knows where to sniff out actual intelligence when it’s present. “So do the
      myths seem more real in your country, sir? Or are they still another
      misunderstanding of folk practices or natural phenomena?” “I haven’t heard
      much in the way of such things recently, but there is always the odd story
      of children being spirited away and replaced. More and more I find the
      breed of stories of farmers being helped out by the Good Folk diminishing
      dramatically.” He clears his throat before continuing. “Those old legends
      of the seelie faries—of brownies and knockers, for example—are really just
      one way of exaggerating the acts of men who, for one reason or another,
      find themselves cast out of every village they visit. Left with little
      recourse except to live a hermit’s life, they briefly appear to lend a
      welcome hand in menial tasks such as the harvesting of crops, through
      which they hope to build a friendly relationship.”’ “That sounds like a
      very noble way to live a life,” I remark. “Yes, but on the other hand, you
      have the tales of kidnapped children, where the stories of changelings
      come from. Some legends are about gentry kidnapping certain children they
      believe to be of some random stock blessed by God. Their desire for these
      children leads them to swap the child.” “What happens to the kidnapped
      child?” As soon as I say the question, Mr. Kurogiri reacts with a wide
      grin. “Ah, do not fret so much on it. They usually turned out the way they
      were before. You see, since it was gentry that took them, it was usually
      easy to find the child in the baptismal records of a church. Any man,
      nobilis or no, had their child baptized lest the child suffer in society
      through persecution. So a trip to the church usually satisfied the
      altercation quite legally.” I sigh, and almost smile, until he continues.
      “But then there are the cases where this is not true, where no other
      sensible explanation is true. There are the children actually whisked away
      by the fae, the ones they called changelings.” “So you do believe in them,
      sir?” “Yes,” he says without hesitation, “I think they exist. But it
      doesn’t mean I have to like them. The pranks they pull sometimes go much,
      much too far. The changelings are one example. They would kidnap a child,
      sometimes keeping it for many years, and then return it inexplicably on
      its parent’s doorstep. Then its parents would find their joy quickly
      curtailed when the child rapidly grows ill, its very essence misaligned,
      only to die a slow, lonely death, hated by its parents and lost to the
      world.” I almost bring a hand to my mouth. This was certainly not the
      kinds of fairy tales I had grown up hearing. “Oh, I am sorry,” the
      instructor quickly says. “It seems I have spoken overmuch yet again.”
      “N—no,” I utter meekly. “I enjoyed it quite well, sir. If you’ll excuse
      me, however…” I let the sentence hang unfinished, give a curt bow, and
      hurry away with uneasy but quickened steps, as far away from Mr. Kurogiri
      as my feet will reasonably carry me. Noon passes, and more out of a
      combined desire to get away from Mr. Kurogiri and simultaneously avoid
      Shiki more than anything else, I decide to head to the burned down
      dormitory in the eastern end of the campus. I’m not particularly certain
      I’ll glean anything of actual importance there, but I feel like I should
      visit the place that Hideo Hayama tried to burn down at least once, seeing
      as my investigation seems to be heading closer and closer to that
      direction. When I stand before the dormitory, I see its perimeter
      surrounded by ropes, a “No Entry” sign in place to discourage any casual
      would-be intruders. Obviously, it’s not enough to deter me. I walk over
      the ropes and toward the imposing structure. Most of it is a burned down
      hulk, the rooms formerly lined up on its east wing completely gutted, as
      though a giant monster clawed it down from roof to foundation. What little
      partitions remain that were once the walls and floors of its rooms are
      crumbling and blackened wood and concrete. In contrast, immediately
      westward of that sight is the building’s west wing, the corridor leading
      out of the rooms and everything west of it surviving largely intact.
      Walking through the corridor, you’d never notice that immediately to the
      east, beyond doors that remain closed, a fire had taken the other half.
      Open the doors, however, and you see only the campus and the verdant trees
      beyond, like a bad piece of installation art. Maybe it’s better to have
      the doors remain closed, as respect to the last bitter taste of normalcy
      this building still has. Though his name bounces around in my mind more
      and more these days, I’ve only really seen Hideo Hayama the one time. He
      was teaching in classes C through E, so he never had any reason to come to
      class A. The one time I saw him was during a morning service, looking
      bored and flipping absentmindedly through the pages of a Bible. I took him
      to be at least thirty years old, and his face plain and unassuming. “How
      am I supposed to look into him when I don’t even know the first thing
      about the man?” Now I’m talking to myself, which is probably a sign that
      there’s little left for me here and that I should leave. I descend from
      the second floor back to the first using the lonely, barely lit stairwell,
      making my way to the still-intact exit. Only to find a familiar figure
      blocking the exit, shadowed by the afternoon sun. Though her features are
      obscured, it’s easy enough to figure out. There is little else in Reien
      with black hair as fine, and features as delicate as Misaya Ōji, the
      secret power behind the academy. She walks towards me wordlessly, and
      something makes me feel I should hold my tongue until she has her chance
      to speak. She stops when she is only two meters in front of me. She looks
      me straight in the face, and grants me a gentle smile. “So tell me, Miss
      Kokutō. Has there been progress in your efforts?” Misaya Ōji says to me.
      As soon as she says that, the temperature seems almost to drop a few
      precious degrees, though I can’t say for certain why, or even if it’s
      real. But it’s enough to put me on guard. Her voice is familiar, more so
      than the level that I associate with the many snippets of conversation
      that I have heard through her in the past months, but on a more recent
      level. Somehow, a memory of a noise, of an echoing chorus like the buzzing
      of flies, comes to mind. Memory turns to reality, and I am certain the
      noise swelling to some kind of low crescendo that I hear right now is
      similar. The fact falls into place, and I realize belatedly that this will
      be a repeat of what happened to me yesterday. My memories will be stolen
      again, and I will stand here dazed and confused for god knows how long
      this time. I don’t have my glove handy right now for a quick spell, but
      there is little choice. The flame calls, and perhaps it is not yet too
      late. I focus on Misaya Ōji in front of me, and then weave my Art, feeling
      the pattern around me and sensing hot currents in the air like Shiki told
      me to. I can feel the spell working, and I close my eyes almost
      reflexively, trusting the Art to tell me of any unnatural pockets of heat
      in the air. And then— “—Gotcha!” Something warm tried to draw near my
      chest, but I catch it with my bare hands before it can hit me. I’ve
      definitely caught something with my hand, and it’s making a frantic,
      keening noise. I ignore it for now and open my eyes, keeping my gaze
      locked and level with Misaya Ōji. “Well, well,” she says, as if she had
      expected the entire thing. “You told me that you’ve never seen the fae in
      your life, but here you are swatting one away?” Her tone is enough to
      assure me, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that she is the enemy I’ve been
      looking for. “I see. So my one hour blank yesterday was me talking to
      you.” “Yes, and you have made things so much easier for me. My children
      have made it simple for me to know what sort of person you truly are, Miss
      Kokutō.” She raises a hand to brush something unseen on her shoulder, and
      I hear the same familiar keening sound in response. Another fairy? No. If
      I wove my spell right, then there is a minutely abnormal amount of heat
      all around her, a rough estimate numbering in fifty such sources. And
      though I don’t truly see the fairies, I am almost overwhelmed by the truly
      impressive amount of potential she can bring to bear. “Your composure is
      admirable, Miss Kokutō. It almost seems as if you’re not even surprised,
      though I know it is a simple lie. However, I was surprised at what I
      learned about you. To think that there would be someone in the academy
      that studied the Art besides myself.” “You don’t surprise me, Miss Ōji.
      I’ve known from the beginning that there was a mage here with fairy
      familiars. But you; you waited for me to be alone didn’t you? To be
      vulnerable, and then eliminate me? Commendable strategy, but it seems a
      mistake to me to reveal yourself.” I try to stall for time, scanning the
      area around me for alternative exits. I remind myself that my part here is
      only reconnaissance, not a fight. While I’d gladly take a fistfight any
      day of the week, even I don’t desire a duel to the death between mages
      such as us. “Perish the thought. I never thought to remove you, Miss
      Kokutō. Why would I, when you are one of the few of my breed of person?
      Understanding each other would be better than to put a blade at each
      other’s throats in this situation, yes?” “Says the person who tried to set
      her fairy familiars on me.” “Oh I only tried to learn more about you, my
      dear. Very useful, if we are to have any sort of meaningful conversation
      and avoid meaningless deaths,” she says with a deathly calm voice. Is she
      actually serious? I glance for a moment at the corridor that stretches
      behind me—my only means of escape—and try to stall her to until she
      reveals some point where I can retreat in relative safety. “Talk? With
      me?” “Why of course! You visited this desolate place, Miss Kokutō, and
      that is enough to endear you to me. For this place is—” “—the place where
      Kaori Tachibana lost her life, isn’t it?” Ōji nods, satisfied. Her eyes,
      however, still betray a merciless and spiteful mien, cold as winter. “The
      one student in November’s unfortunate fire that somehow couldn’t get away.
      You knew her, Miss Ōji?” Another graceful nod at my question. “I valued
      Kaori very dearly, like I would a little sister. She took in hardship her
      entire life, but her faith in the Almighty God was beyond question. And
      yet, she died here, her life free of great sin and still full of beauty.
      She had chosen a difficult path for herself.” Ōji’s voice descends into a
      tinge of melancholy, but I cannot find any mercy in her words. “And though
      this horrible tragedy has taken place, the girls have not yet learned
      their lesson. They have not renounced their sins, even as they live
      knowing that Kaori lost her life as a sacrifice. That is not the manner of
      a human. The students of class D are all sinners, and sinners cannot be
      permitted to sully my institution. Garbage such as them must always be
      burnt away.” “Wait, so you’re saying that the students of class D killed
      Kaori Tachibana?” “No. That would give them too much credit. Miss Kokutō,
      Kaori took her own life. But I cannot expect you to understand what that
      truly implies.” Her gaze full of disdain doesn’t stray away from me for a
      second even as I wonder what she’s truly trying to say. At the very least,
      I can gather that class D was somehow involved in Kaori Tachibana’s death
      in the fire. But what did she mean that I wouldn’t understand? “Then all
      of this is payback for Kaori Tachibana’s sake?” “Correct. I swear that as
      long as I stand, those girls will see hellfire, and they will find no rest
      in their days here in Reien.” “So you would kill them, then?” I ask
      desperately, though I think the answer is obvious enough already. Misaya
      Ōji recognizes no humanity in her prey. Murder is not enough for her. She
      will see them purged thoroughly. But even as I think this, she surprises
      me by shaking her head. “Why should I? Killing them is no guarantee that
      they will be sent to the pits of hell where they rightfully belong. This
      is why I say you do not understand, though I do not blame you. Stay your
      hand and stand down, Miss Kokutō. I do not desire to fight you today.” She
      brushes the invisible fairy perched on her shoulder as she says this; a
      subtle, yet unnerving movement. “Though you cannot truly see them, these
      little folk are pregnant with memories, yours included. Striking, isn’t
      it? Your memories are the beauty of cold, smooth marble, yet they burn
      with an inner fire. And though they are as unseen to me as the fae are to
      you, I can feel the purity of your recollections. You are truly splendid,
      Miss Kokutō.” Her gentle smile only serves to make her tender speech more
      unnerving. And when I look at her, I welcome the arrival of another
      emotion, one I haven’t felt in this intensity in almost three years. An
      emotion that I felt when I first saw Mikiya with Shiki. The urge to kick
      the ass of the woman in front of me as hard as I can. We stand there for a
      few more moments as she waits for my reply, and I don’t give an inch to
      her thinly veiled threat. As far as I’m concerned, she’s violated me as
      surely as if she’d stolen all of my belongings, and that demands a display
      of response as potent as I can muster. I banish the thought of escaping
      from my mind, and stay until finally, I elicit a small sigh from Misaya.
      “You have made your choice, then. And I was so looking forward to getting
      to know you better. Is there truly no room in your heart for a truce,
      Miss—” “None whatsoever,” I quickly cut in. Misaya only chuckles. “Is that
      so? A shame. I had taken you for kindred, and we share so much alike. Our
      intense passions for our brothers, for example.” “Wh—wha,” I struggle to
      finish but the word doesn’t come out completely. My throat dries
      instantly, and I know my face is turning beet red by the second. Misaya
      Ōji, on the other hand, only closes her eyes, truly enjoying herself.
      “Yes, it came straight from your lips yesterday, but I suppose you do not
      remember. I know about your brother, and about you becoming a mage. You
      see? We travel in the same direction. Though you have practiced the Art
      for half a year now, I have claimed it only recently.” The Art. That most
      potent of words strikes me deep, and reinforces my understanding of the
      situation’s gravity: that I am fighting another weaver of magic, and that
      the unconventional nature of such duels makes them quick and deadly.
      Misaya continues. “When Kaori died, I learned how to craft the fae
      familiars, and the Art of robbing memories. Not for the typical mage’s
      lofty goals of enlightenment, but as tools for my own purpose. I collect
      the memories relating to Kaori only for her sake, to remove all vestiges
      of her shame. I care little about anything else. I am not destroying
      anything, nor committing murder. And you still think this a selfish goal,
      Miss Kokutō?” “I don’t think it’s for me to judge, but you have terrorized
      the students of class D, as well as troubled a teacher. Why you had to
      affect Mr. Kurogiri though, I can’t seem to grasp.” At the mention of his
      name, I notice Misaya’s eyebrow twitch. She must know as well that Mr.
      Kurogiri only became class D’s homeroom instructor well after Kaori
      Tachibana died and Hideo Hayama disappeared. He has little relation to the
      incident. Why, then, has he too had his memory plundered by the fairies?
      “It seems to me to be a bit overzealous for you to take his,” I say
      outright. I thought she would betray some flaw in her plan, but contrary
      to what I expected, she lowers her worried eyebrow and scoffs with a noise
      half in annoyance as well as amusement. “Not overzealous, I should think.
      All this is of little consequence to him, but the truth must still be
      hidden from him.” “But why?” Misaya Ōji turns sideward, her hair swaying
      gently swaying as she answers. “Because my blood is his blood. Because he
      is my true brother.” “Your true brother? Him?” I stutter out, unbelieving.
      Maybe it’s nothing but a great coincidence, but I realize that it isn’t
      out of the realm of possibility. The Ōji all adopt their daughters, so
      Misaya’s former name might really have been Misaya Kurogiri, for all I
      know. Misaya elaborates, unmindful of my surprise. “At first, I didn’t
      know. After Kaori’s death, I was full of suspicion at the entirety of
      class D, and turned to their new instructor in my desperation. I talked to
      him, asking for some way to help me deal with all this, when alone I could
      do nothing. And Mr. Kurogiri was truly kind. For the sake of knowing this
      gentle soul better, I snatched his memories. But that too was a blessing,
      for there in his dreaming was the proof that he was my true brother.
      Somehow, he knew something about the true nature of Kaori’s death, and so
      regrettably I had to silence him.” She casts her eyes downwards before
      continuing. “Once when I was little and knew nothing, my brother said to
      me that I should honor the living more than the dead. But how can I do
      that now, when the ones still alive, living peacefully, are the ones that
      pushed Kaori to her suicide? I remembered what my brother said to me long
      ago, and so I couldn’t stand to see him burdened by that knowledge. So I
      took away his memory of the incident, and of me being his sister. All of
      it. Satsuki will live without worry, and love me without regret. And
      having done this, there is no turning back for me.” I am at a loss for
      words at the gravity of her act. She says we are alike, a statement that
      may be true. But I look at her, and listen to her, and realize that we are
      alike only in so many superficial ways. What we desire may be similar, but
      our means cannot be more different. “But that had a use to you as well,
      didn’t it?” I reply. “You took his memories only to preserve the secret of
      class D. But what will you do about me, I wonder?” “That will be decided
      by you soon enough, surely? I have taught you about our common ground,
      Miss Kokutō, and I understand the discord within you. And with time, I can
      grant you the thing which you’ve longed for so much.” Misaya holds out her
      hand to me, conciliatory and genuine. I look at her outstretched arm, the
      arm of an enemy that throws her crimes in my face. “I’m willing to
      overlook this, on a condition…” I lie to her. At the same time, I think
      about what she is truly capable of doing, and a thought crosses my mind,
      unbidden. If she could truly do as she says she can do— “…if you can bring
      back to me a long forgotten memory.” —then perhaps her Art can be mine. “A
      forgotten memory?” she says, amused. “Like you, I have a brother that I
      love dearly. But the memory of the moment I fell in love with him has been
      lost. If you can bring back that memory from my mind—” “It cannot be done,
      I’m afraid. If you yourself have forgotten it, it is no longer a memory.
      Merely a record of one. And the fae only extract the former.” I sigh,
      disappointed, but also somewhat relieved. “Then it seems a deal can’t be
      brokered between us.” I tense my muscles for what I know will come next.
      There is little distance between us. Only two bounding steps, and I can be
      close enough to kick her in the face if I wanted to. Misaya too, leans
      forward, shifting her center. “Miss Kokutō, you know that a familiar must
      be crafted from something, yes?” I know at least that much. Does she think
      I’m new to the Art? “Then you must know that what you hold in your hand
      was borne from some material.” There is a keenness to her smile. I find
      that my gaze falls to the thing I have been keeping secured in my hand the
      entire time. But though before I couldn’t see it, now I find that I can.
      The fairy’s appearance differs from what I expected. Here, in my hand, is
      the form of a person I had seen only once, a little Hideo Hayama. I
      inadvertently let it go with a startled cry. In that instant of weakness,
      Misaya Ōji rushes forward. I black out with the kind of intensity that
      overtakes victims of blood loss, but before it I see only the image of
      Misaya Ōji reaching out with a hand and touching my forehead.
