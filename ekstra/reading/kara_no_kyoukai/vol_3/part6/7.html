    <h1 class="title">Records in Oblivion - VII</h1>
    <p>
      I head immediately to the high school building after I get off the phone
      with Mikiya. The hour has just passed 1pm, but already the cloud-thick sky
      overhead is filled to bursting, the sun barely peeking out behind the
      leaden blanket. “Rain is coming early today.” I whisper. The cold winter
      air mixes with the scent of the black pines in the forest and the coolness
      settles into my lungs when I breathe it in. I suspect, under normal
      circumstances, the odor would be enchanting, but now I can’t help but
      judge it as vaguely unsettling. A few minutes later, I am glad to be out
      of the forest path and into the high school building. I walk the
      corridors, meeting no one else, the building’s desertion granting it a
      desolate loneliness. Nothing moves as I traverse the building, making my
      way to the English instructor’s classroom. When I arrive, I do not bother
      to knock, simply opening the door to find Mr. Kurogiri sitting in his
      chair facing the door and me, as if he was waiting, as if he knew
      everything. He is smiling as though everything were normal, unsurprised by
      my unannounced appearance. My eyes wander to his left arm, hanging lazily
      like dead weight still tethered to his body. In an instant, I know exactly
      who is responsible for it. “Shiki did that to you, didn’t she, sir?”
      “Yes.” Satsuki Kurogiri nods. “In appreciation of her skill in destroying
      my arm, I let her go freely. Miss Shiki is unharmed. She should be awake
      within the hour. I cannot say the same for this arm, though.” With the
      ashen sunlight spilling through from the window behind him, Satsuki
      Kurogiri has some illusory, dreamlike mien, and the manner with which he
      is at peace is in itself disturbing. I hold my breath for only a second,
      and then exhale, deciding to ask the questions I have been tempted to ask.
      “It was you who troubled Kaori Tachibana, wasn’t it, sir?” “Yes.” Satsuki
      Kurogiri nods. “And the one who made Hideo Hayama disappear…” “Yes.” The
      instructor nods. “And the one who granted Miss Ōji her Art…” “Yes.” The
      mage nods. “And the one collecting all our forgotten memories…” “Yes.” The
      man nods. “So the story about you being taken by the fairies is true
      then.” “Yes,” he nods with a smile. “But why?” It is the only question I
      can put to words. “Why you?” The second question comes more clumsily than
      the first. The eyes behind the glasses do not twitch one bit, or darken as
      he leans slightly forward. “It wasn’t for me to put a purpose behind it.
      Whether it be Miss Tachibana, or Miss Ōji, or Mr. Hayama, the only thing I
      did is grant their true desires. As for why they wished such things, you
      had best ask them yourself. I can’t answer.” Somehow, I know he speaks
      truth. The answers aren’t for him to give. When Kaori Tachibana, in
      desperation, turned to Satsuki Kurogiri for advice, he showed her a way
      out of it all that could only have come from someone like her. The choice
      of salvation by suicide was hers alone. When Misaya Ōji, in anger, shared
      her desire to recompense Kaori’s death, he showed her the means to punish
      class D by terrorizing them into terrified inaction, a means that could
      only have come from her. The choice to learn magic from him was hers
      alone. All seemed pure. None of it contained the ulterior motive one would
      suspect of a mage. “But gathering memories seems out of place for all
      this. All the things you made people remember, none of them truly wanted.”
      “Is that so? And why do you think that, Miss Kokutō?” The lilt in his
      voice contains little suspicion, as though the question was sprung out of
      pure curiosity. All of this is the epitome of strange. I’d come to this
      room expecting to finally confront the man behind the black curtain of
      madness enveloping the school, but here stands Satsuki Kurogiri asking me
      a question as though we had never left a classroom, him still the
      instructor, and I still an eager student. “Because I certainly never
      wished for mine to be taken away.” I decide to answer him squarely.
      “Maybe. But you do not even remember the memory, so how could you have
      even thought of it? It sounds suspiciously similar to my situation, Miss
      Kokutō.” “What do you mean, sir?” “It’s very simple, really. I am
      compelled to seek out memories so that I can better understand people
      better. There really is no other way for me to comprehend people other
      than reading the record. It is why I collect the memories lost to
      oblivion.” He speaks as if talking of some long past event, and the way he
      leans his head on his hands puts a pensive silhouette against the gray
      sunlight. His eyes that lack any sort of emotion stare at me with a
      curious judgment, and I try my best to return the favor. “I am seeking a
      less vague reason, sir. For example, the reason why you begun to collect
      the memories in the first place. Don’t you only seek out your own past?”
      Immediately, Mikiya’s detailed report comes back to mind. I remember the
      little detail about how Satsuki Kurogiri, at ten years of age, was
      supposedly kidnapped by fairies. Upon hearing the question, the man lets
      slip a low hum which I take for an impression of admiration. “You surprise
      me, Miss Kokutō. You have done your research well, it looks like. Yes, it
      as you imply. I had a run-in with the fae in my youth. After that
      incident, memories have become difficult to place. The best medical
      science had to offer couldn’t help, but the glamour that the fae influence
      granted me eventually expressed itself in the Art, and I thought that it
      could help me where the world couldn’t. So I tried to learn the Art in a
      bid to reclaim my forgotten memories. If it weren’t for that incident, I
      wouldn’t have needed to do all of this.” Far from anger, his speech is one
      of repentance and regret. “Then why?” “I have told you. Whatever eldritch
      magic the fae forced on my mind compels me to do so. I’ve learned so much
      about the Art, but I am still a riddle to myself. The mind never truly
      forgets, but only in intact minds. But my memories are not simply lost to
      some temporary oblivion, but damaged and fragmented. There is only one
      last way to reclaim them, and that is to read the records of the pattern
      of reality; all the memories, one person at a time. Fortunately, the fae
      glamour granted me an ability that could allowed me the freedom to pursue
      that. But it is fast becoming fruitless. No one can tell me anything about
      myself. And it separates me from the rest of humanity. So I have no choice
      except to feed on the memories of myself that people make, their own
      personal interpretations of me. That this requires me to tap into the
      spiral of origin, the final goal of all mages, is fortunate, and through
      it, I can see inside you for what you are, and hopefully find something to
      put inside of me.” “And you do it by tapping into the Akashic Record?” I
      shake my head in disdain as I say it. When Miss Tōko first told me about
      the Akashic Record, the origin of everything, it seemed such a nebulous
      concept that I couldn’t bring myself to believe it. The fact that she had
      tried but failed to reach it had only served to help my stance. A
      collective record of all that has happened, and will happen, given
      metaphysical being by the combined consensus of all humanity, pursued by
      mages in a quest for ascension seemingly designed to make them solitary
      creatures. “But sir, if you can do that, can you not find your own past
      there?” My voice weakens, as if it carries not only my words but this
      man’s own end. However, he shifts his smile only ever so slightly, in a
      manner of observing some kind of cosmic amusement. “It is a certainty that
      I could. But I don’t. I’d much rather construct myself from something new,
      such as the memories of other people. Tell me, Miss Kokutō. Why do people
      forget?” The sudden question forces a gulp in my throat. I hesitate to
      answer at first, and then, “Because there’s a limit to how much our brain
      can recall at haste. There are memories that need to be recovered faster
      than others, and with the passage of time, the memories we don’t need only
      grow larger. We need it, to bring a semblance of order to our perception
      of reality.” “Certainly the correct technical answer. But you
      misunderstand me. The question was not how time chips away at our
      memories, but why we can even choose to forget our past. Look at you, Miss
      Kokutō. You know what you must say, but you do not relish the words.” Mr.
      Kurogiri shifts comfortably in his seat, the rays of gray sunlight behind
      him shifting with a wild accordance to his movement. Reflexively, I am
      forced to take another empty swallow of air. “We…choose to forget to
      protect ourselves. Is that the right of it, sir?” At this point, all the
      force in my voice has been lost. He’s right. Yes, of course I know. He
      reads me so easily, and even just being here in front of him feels as if
      I’ve encountered someone ten times my intellectual superior. I’m a child
      again. I know, more so than most, that sometimes, remembering is more
      dangerous than forgetting. The sins of the past are faintly recalled, so
      all of us can claim the illusion of purity, so that we can judge ourselves
      better than the next person. “Quite correct. You all choose to forget the
      crimes, the taboo, and your contrition, resigning them as a deeper part of
      yourselves that you can lock away and never look upon again. They’re dirty
      and stained records, and to look for them only brings pain. It is the same
      reason I am torn between finding the truth of my past, and choosing to
      discard it. But it is that emotion that I am cursed to feed upon, and so I
      return the records of those lost memories to their owners. Everyone
      chooses to forget some past stain. It’s not a sin. It is the only way we
      know how to live. It’s also part of what makes us better than monsters. We
      are aware of our sins. But I find I cannot separate myself from my past,
      but I know that if I return to it, I will return to a world of uncertainty
      and constant conflict. Such a world is undesirable, lacking the eternity I
      need. I grant the wishes of people to stave back that force of conflict,
      leaving them to exercise their freedom in the memories that they’ve
      carelessly forgotten. If they commit evil because of it, then the blame
      can be laid at their feet, not mine.” His words ring strangely. He says he
      searches for a past he desires in the dormant memories of people, and
      through it he, inadvertently or not, makes the person himself remember. He
      claims human agency as the reason he does not sin when he does this, but
      all that only has the hollow tone of a child’s excuse. “And you still
      think that there is no evil in what you do, even if it clearly results in
      more conflict and death. Don’t you think you’re deluding yourself too much
      in your pursuit?” “Yes. I truly believe in that fact. I do not desire
      anything, save for a means to see a definitive conclusion to my
      predicament.” While his declaration does not strike me as confident, he
      grants it an air of unnerving naturality, as though it was such an obvious
      fact that he is stymied by my ignorance. But he has some measure of that
      ignorance as well. He thinks all memories are forgotten because of some
      old sin, when that is far from the truth. Some memories are forgotten only
      because they are not needed. Childish illusions and images of things, like
      clouds as animals, or the horizon as a reachable destination, are
      discarded as one grows older to make way for the truth. These memories
      serve no more use in a world of adult perspectives, except as humor based
      on a time of mere ignorance and shame. “I pity you, then,” I say,
      surprising even myself with what comes out of my mouth. “It is only right
      to claim back your own past before toying with the memories of others.”
      Again, no reaction from him. “But how so, when it was the fae themselves
      that robbed me of my memories? My memories about my time with them must be
      confused, complicated, and I cannot truly hope to understand them.”
      “Wouldn’t understand…?” I parrot back at him stupidly, frowning. What does
      he mean by that? Since we have talked he has tended to refer to his
      circumstances as distant, like it was another person’s troubles and not
      his own. I don’t know from where that mannerism stems from, but… “The
      fairies destroyed your memories?” He nods. “Yes. To a limited extent. I
      didn’t lose myself. But they tied me always to the oblivion of strangers,
      ensuring that even when I escaped them, I’d never be able to go back home
      again.” And now, for the first time, comes a change in the face he wears.
      It is not a truly big change, but for him, any change must be marked, as
      though his face exhibited this sort of transformation in the passing of
      strange aeons. The smile he wears is now warped, a parody of its previous
      self, reflecting some dark image in his mind that he would rather forget,
      but still finds some sick pleasure in returning to. He continues, the tone
      of his voice changing slightly, though I can’t seem to detect what quality
      has entered them. “The fae took me as a child, yes. For what purpose, I
      can’t say. Maybe they wanted to toy with me. Maybe they wanted a friend. I
      didn’t understand them. All they said was they wanted ‘eternity.’ I only
      wanted to go home. I knew the stories about children abducted by fairies.
      Replaced by changelings, never to go home again. I tried as hard as I
      could to cast aside their words and run. I ran and ran, stumbling on the
      overlarge roots of the trees, until finally, I slipped out of the forest
      sighting the open field that led to my home. Only when I saw the house did
      I dare to look back inside. And all I could see were countless corpses of
      little fae things, covered all in bright blood. And when I looked on my
      hands, I saw it was covered the same. And I knew then that the legends
      were true. That you could never go back. They made me theirs forever. You
      can imagine what happened at home after that.” The cruel smile never
      leaves his face. So he was gone—for three days, according to Mikiya’s
      report—and comes back home covered in eerie blood. The reaction he’d
      receive is clear enough. And that event would inform everything that comes
      afterward. All its warm familiarity replaced by a cold fear. “So the
      fairies didn’t kidnap you—” “No. It seems I killed all of them in some mad
      dream. And in return, I was cursed with something I will never see the end
      of. My memories are never truly lost. But I fear that when I have them,
      they will be alien and unrecognizable as my own. And now, after that
      unfortunate event, I can no longer recall anything I experience.
      Everything after that is no longer memory, but mere information, and the
      world no longer images, but data. The world stopped when I was ten, and
      though the how and why of it eludes me, it is a curse no should ever be
      forced to endure.” He struggles to hold back a chuckle from escaping his
      careful lips. Satsuki Kurogiri’s mind was altered by the fairies, making
      it so that he never grew up from being ten years old. He says such strange
      things. Does he mean something metaphorical or literal when he said that
      he couldn’t recall anything he experiences? But that can’t be right.
      People can’t live like that. No new history being created, learning
      nothing new. A blank book where yesterday is written. If he is not lying,
      then everything repeated back to him always seems to be fresh and new.
      “But that can’t possibly be true, sir. I mean, after all, you know my name
      don’t you? You know I’m Azaka Kokutō. If you cannot retrieve your
      memories, then surely this wouldn’t be known to you.” He takes the
      repudiation in stride. “Is that so? You are nothing but mere words to me,
      Miss Kokutō. You are recorded that way. When I look at you, I see someone
      who closely corresponds to the recorded words, and so I name you Azaka
      Kokutō. If someone were to come along that fit your description as well,
      then she would also be Azaka Kokutō. There is nothing wrong with this. I
      do not recognize you for who you are, but only a collection of
      information: height, weight, structure, skin color, hair, speech, age, and
      such. You are only Azaka Kokutō to me because you are the closest to
      fulfilling the criteria I have set for you. Encoding, storage, and
      recognition all work. Only the retrieval portion of the process is
      damaged. Of course, this method will have its inevitable mismatches. A
      major change in your appearance is enough to ensure that I recognize you
      as someone different. The school has called me easy to forget because of
      this, and I am only happy to let them think this.” Now the smile
      disappears from his face entirely, replaced by a blank, straight faced
      expression. Somehow, it calms me. In his explanation, I think I can see
      the reason why I’d thought he bore an uncanny resemblance to Mikiya. Both
      of them put in nothing of themselves when judging another person, willing
      to listen to anyone and give them a chance. It is only that one single
      peculiarity that binds them, but also the same property that separates
      them clearly. Satsuki Kurogiri only does it to find himself in the
      memories and desires of others, and he is driven to hear and grant them.
      He is childish in his beliefs, and his inability to recognize his mocking
      smile is a greater proof of that. He has no thoughts, no original ideas,
      unable to understand complex concepts. That is why he can only know people
      by collecting their lost memories. Like a machine, he reflects it back at
      those who speak to him, and in a world where an independent will is
      necessary for function, he is uniquely crippled. “I pity you,” I repeat.
      “You’re never certain about your reality.” There is a pause, and then a
      silent, patient nod, and then, “But that is enough for me. I do not feel
      that I smile. I see my five fingers, I know I move them, but I cannot feel
      my arm as my own. My body too is just information in the end. But we are
      creatures of the mind, aren’t we? Our mind is all we need. The world we
      see is only stimulus in our brains. Reality is always vague, and we can
      never be certain if it is all a lie. All of it is subjective. Our Art that
      changes reality itself should be proof enough of that. All that we can be
      certain of is what is inside our very heads, the mind and its soul that
      are outside of this material prison. But even the true reality of our
      minds is corrupted by the curse of this fallen world. It is why the
      gathering of memories so interests me. Through it, I can perhaps study the
      human consensus that gives this world its power. But I always remember:
      dubito ergo cogito ergo sum. We have no need for stable bodies and
      objective realities. The soul itself does not dwell here, and nor does
      eternity, and there is little meaning left in this fallen world, this
      simulacrum.” His face remains level, even uninterested at what he himself
      is saying. He doesn’t really seem to be appealing to me emotionally,
      though at first I tried to understand his plight. But his words tell me
      there is no person in there, no man shaping them. Only some empty book
      moulded by the memories he stole and the ambition of regaining his own
      through the Art. But in the end, those memories betrayed even him. And
      when he switched to looking into the minds of other people, he saw their
      “corruption.” His mind, not having left that forest since he was ten,
      turned to fear. He cannot permit the corruption he sees, nor the
      corruption of the “fallen world.” His fear won’t permit him to. He is
      literally cursed not to think of anything else. “That’s why you searched
      for your memories even after you knew it was impossible,” I observe. “The
      fairies bound you to.” The man of the demiurge nods. “A mage once shared
      to me his plan of ascension by recording the deaths of all humanity. But I
      desire a world of eternity, because I love humanity too much. But it is
      too much for me. I do not know what to think anymore. There is too much
      noise. Everyone must be at peace, but they do so much to throw it away. I
      cannot guide them to that quiescence. I only try to find all the answers
      in memory, in the hopes that the shared history of humanity can give me
      something. It is quite possible it will be fruitless. But since the future
      holds nothing for me, there is no other way.” It saddens me to look at him
      now, a creature that cannot even begin to realize that people forget the
      common answers so quickly. He believes—or is cursed to believe—that’s what
      makes us imperfect creatures. And within the contradictions of the people
      whose memories he has robbed, and within the contradictions of his own
      shattered recollections, he has the singular hope of finding the answer to
      that problem. “I have only two questions left to ask,” I declare. His
      unflinchingly smiling face seems to eat in the sentence. “And what would
      those be?” he asks. “You didn’t need to collect the lost memories, nor did
      you need to grant wishes. Why did you do so?” He nods in unspoken
      comprehension. “Simple enough. It is what I need to feel, at the very
      least, human. Though the fae have their curse, the granting of wishes is
      an act I can own, an act beyond the fae magic. Do it enough times, I
      figure, and I can start to believe I’m doing out of my own will. And
      that’s what we all need to feel human. Without it, I would not have
      purpose. It is the natural inclination of a mage, isn’t it, Azaka Kokutō?
      These were the words you wanted to hear.” I sigh deeply, as the man who
      would grant people’s wishes and dreams nods contentedly to himself. Before
      I move to leave the room, I inquire one last thing, not as the girl
      assigned to investigate this whole incident, but as Azaka Kokutō, the
      person. “One last thing before I leave. What is Misaya Ōji to you?” My
      interest and concern in this person has long left, but the answer to this
      question will tell me everything I need to know about him. And perhaps I
      can find the last bit of a person inside him. But the answer is just as I
      had thought. “Miss Ōji is what she is. Does that concern you?” “Misaya Ōji
      loves you, you know.” “A fleeting illusion, I am sure.” “So you harbor no
      love for her?” “That is for her to decide.” Simple answers that
      nevertheless ring hollow. No humanity is in that voice, but only a calm
      acceptance. “And that is the will you value so dearly?” “Yes, I suppose.
      In the end, she was not so different from the other students, really. Nor
      was she exempt from my acts. No one was. But it was Misaya Ōji that
      immediately suited my needs.” He says all this with the collectedness of
      someone relaying simple data, but I am more concerned about his curious
      statement than he is. I take one step forward at him. “No. Don’t tell me—”
      “Yes. Class D was not the only group I affected. All the people on this
      campus bears my touch in some way. After all, it is not only class D that
      contained a stain on their conscience that needed to come to light. You
      all just haven’t noticed it yet.” But that’s absurd. If he’s echoed the
      sins of close to eight hundred people, then he’s also reflected the wishes
      of just as many. Within that number, there must be at least someone who
      hates Satsuki Kurogiri enough to wish for his death. She might be on the
      move even now— “Let me stop you right there, Miss Kokutō. There is no need
      to worry. If someone were to move to intend me harm, then let it be so.
      Whatever her wish, or whatever its outcome, the sin falls to her alone.
      Again, it is not for me to judge.” He talks as if to ignore his own death.
      It is not the words of someone prepared to die, but someone who devalues
      his own existence. “I…am mistaken, then,” I say nervously. Before, I
      thought this man could do no real harm. But now I find that is untrue. The
      damage he does is far deeper and more sinister than I’d ever tried to
      imagine. “You were never like Mikiya.” Satsuki Kurogiri nods in seeming
      satisfaction. I turn my back on him, moving toward the door. This place
      has already tired me, and my business with him is done. “That was a long
      interrogation,” he calls behind me. “Longer than any conversation I’ve
      had, maybe.” “Not by my own choice, you’ll find. My mentor sent me here to
      run an investigation into all this. And because Miss Ōji can’t be here to
      ask the same questions, as I am sure she would.” I continue walking toward
      the door. I take one last look at Satsuki Kurogiri, and the expression
      plastered on his face is an odd smile, seeming almost fake and stiff.
      “Miss Ōji is in the old school building. He failed to enlist both you and
      Miss Ryōgi to her cause, so she has been forced to hurry her plans. She
      has gathered the students of class D in the building and plans to burn all
      of them. Yes…you should hurry, if you want to stop her.” My eyes widen,
      and my feet instantly slam into action, breaking into a run out of the
      room and the building. That final statement was, I feel, made out of his
      own volition, and not through any fae curse, but I only notice this when I
      am already well out of the main building.
