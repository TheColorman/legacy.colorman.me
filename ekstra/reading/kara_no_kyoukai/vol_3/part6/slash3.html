    <p>
      “If memories are painted in our minds as clearly as any image, why are we
      able to forget?” he asks. “Forgetting is natural,” I answer. “Those are
      only things you can’t bring to mind. Even you remember such things.
      Memories slough off me like rotten skin, but my mind is not the mind of
      man. The mind of man loses nothing,” he says. “But to be unable to bring
      something to mind is to forget it,” I protest. “Forgetting is a
      degeneration, not a loss. Only excess from which color retreats. Isn’t it
      wasteful? All of it is the stuff of eternity, withering and rusting. But
      such eternity can only be disposed by one’s own will,” he says. I offer no
      answer. “Eternity is relentless, and this lingering grief must be
      retrieved and returned to you. Though you think it lost to oblivion, the
      memory repeats like a record.” “Who decides what is eternal and what is
      not?” I ask. “No one knows. That is why we search,” he answers. He is one
      for whom thoughts are foreign and cannot be derived, one whose answers are
      merely emanations of the past, and of snatched ideas and the disparate
      thoughts of strangers. A knock on the door rouses me to wake. Immediately,
      I see the window, and the ashen sunlight streaking through it that makes
      me unable to determine whether it’s morning or noon. A quick glance at the
      desk clock confirms my suspicion that it is already past noon. “Miss
      Kokutō, are you there?” I hear a voice call from outside the room. It’s
      only then that the splitting headache I always get from oversleeping
      starts to become apparent, and reflexively, I hold a hand to the side of
      my head because of the pain. I try to ignore it as I descend from the top
      bunk and open the door to the room. Standing outside the door is one of
      the nuns, who gives me a once over before a look of confusion settles on
      her face. “Hi. Yeah. Shiki Ryōgi,” I say lazily before I notice that I
      have to keep up appearances. “I am a transferee for the upcoming term.”
      “Er, yes, of course,” says the sister, her look of suspicion slackening
      but not really disappearing. “Miss Kokutō has a phone call from her
      family.” It figures that the one time he family calls, she’s not around to
      take it. Oh well, nothing to be done about it. “Perhaps I could take the
      call in her place, seeing as she is out,” I say. “I am close to the Kokutō
      family, after all.” At least if you count their estranged son, I suppose.
      “I see. Then there is no problem. I shall have the call transferred to the
      lobby phone, so please hurry.” The nun gives one curt bow before leaving
      quickly. I move to exit the room, but realize that I still have Azaka’s
      oversized pajamas on. I get them out of the way and change into one of
      Azaka’s uniform robes, walking as fast as I can to the lobby in the
      dormitory entrance. I saw the phone in the lobby yesterday, lacking any
      dials or buttons, but it was sitting next to a really neat sofa, so maybe
      they’re hoping that makes up for it. According to Azaka, they filter the
      calls, which first go to a room managed by one of the sisters. If it’s not
      the family of one of the students, they have to reject it. If the call has
      their approval, they have it transferred to the lobby phone, where the
      student can take the call privately. Even when I’m going to the lobby, I
      already have a good idea who’s calling, and when I arrive and pick up the
      receiver, it only confirms my suspicions. “Hello?” “Hello, Azaka?” It’s a
      voice I know very well. Mikiya’s voice. I give the lobby a once-over to
      see if no one’s around before talking. “Nope, not this time. Azaka’s out.
      It’s only the fifth day of the new year and already you’re pining after
      your sister?” I say in an unusually cold way, even for me. “Shiki, where’s
      Azaka?” “Dunno. Out, like I told you, doing something or another. She’s
      been in a hell of a hurry since this morning when she tried her best to
      wake me up. I think she really wants to take care of things as fast as
      possible and hurry back home.” “Really? She doesn’t seem to enjoy herself
      much when she’s at home, though. I told her it’d be easier if she stayed
      over there.” “I don’t think here being better for her is any real
      deterrent for her to go home, if you know what I mean.” Of course he
      doesn’t. “So, what’s your business, Mikiya?” “Nothing in particular. I was
      planning on surprising Azaka, but that’s not too important. Just wanted to
      check up on how the two of you are doing.” “Well, I can’t say for sure.
      Maybe if you call up again tomorrow, you can ask Azaka yourself. See ya.”
      “No, wait a minute, Shiki!” I hear his voice coming from the receiver
      right after I move it away from my ear. I look at myself at the mirror at
      the far end of the room, seeing myself holding the receiver and frowning.
      I can’t rightly place why. “You called to talk to Azaka. You don’t have
      anything to say to me, right?” “Yes, I do! I’ve been worried about you.
      Talk to me for a while. Besides, if I’d wanted to talk to you, I’d have
      said Azaka’s name to the nuns over there anyway, since they don’t allow
      any phone calls except for family. Anyway, any progress on the search?”
      “Some. Not a lot. Anyway, I really hate talking on the phone, so maybe we
      can do this later when I’m not interrupting you.” “Alright. Fine. I mean,
      it’s not like I’m allowed to call you again today anyway, so maybe I’ll
      call you tomorrow.” There’s just that little bit of sarcasm in how Mikiya
      says it…on second thought, maybe talking to him for a little while isn’t
      so bad. “Well, if you’re free anyway, maybe you can do me a favor. I can’t
      find out anything from here, so maybe you’ll have more luck outside.
      There’s a former instructor here in Reien by the name of Hideo Hayama, and
      also a guy named Satsuki Kurogiri. Any chance you can get their work
      history before they got here?” Mikiya sighs. “Well, won’t know ‘til I
      try.” “It’s not totally important, so it’s alright if you can’t,” I
      reassure him “I don’t want you getting reckless. Don’t go doing anything
      illegal or something just to get it. Anyway, I probably need to go and
      look for Azaka wandering around the campus.” “Wait, wait. If you’re asking
      me for a favor, then I’ll ask you one too. There’s a student there named
      Kaori Tachibana, and I’d like you to search on her records. Attendance
      records in PE, disciplinary actions, stuff like that. Reien keeps a tight
      lid on their paperwork, so I can’t access it from where I am.” I vaguely
      wonder for a moment what he’s up to, but it’s sure to be something that
      has to be useful if it’s investigating a Reien student. “Alright. If I
      can, I’ll do it. Bye for now, Mikiya.” After saying that, I put the
      receiver back on.
