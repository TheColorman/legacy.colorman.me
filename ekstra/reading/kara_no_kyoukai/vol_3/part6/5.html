    <p>
      “I don’t know what is so good about this arrangement,” I say. “There is
      still a way. There is always a way to mend that which is broken,” the man
      answers. “But can I still be restored?” I ask. “I can remake things. Make
      them whole again. The sin is not yours, and such pure things need not
      touch that which is unclean. Remain as you are, and all will be well,” he
      answers. “But am I pure? Once, perhaps. But now, I am not so sure.”
      “Though you push back the growing darkness in you with your own hands,
      those hands are still clear, still contain no taint.” He nods, and laughs
      a sweet laugh. “And they must remain as such. Filth like that are a cancer
      on this world, and must remove themselves or be excised. It is a mercy to
      do so, for such impurities travel with the soul, to one’s line, passed on
      in a dynasty of endlessly repeated curses. And so as not to sully you,
      another must be used.” But what will come of it? I cannot answer, and I do
      not voice the impudent question to the man. “Eternity is relentless, and
      this lingering grief must be retrieved and returned to you. Though you
      think it lost to oblivion, the memory repeats like a record,” he says. “I
      have forgotten nothing, least of all that,” I reply. “The oblivion are
      thoughts missing in your consciousness, wandering in the vast wastes of
      the oneiros. Not forgotten, not lost,” he says flatly. What, then,
      explains the gaps in my memory? “I do not understand. What of the part of
      me that has been lost?” “The stirrings and thoughts that orient around
      your brother,” answers the man. “Should you wish it, I shall play back
      that echo of nothingness.” It was an easy thing to say yes. *** January 6,
      Wednesday. In the past few days, the weather has taken on a predictable
      pattern, with gray cloudy mornings and clear nights. This morning proves
      to be no different, and it seems resolute to pursue this pattern for a
      while. The first thing I see when I wake up is the clock. “Seven…thirty,”
      I whisper groggily. I can’t believe I overslept for an hour. I immediately
      climb out of bed and whip myself up into a whirlwind of multi-tasking,
      taking off my pajamas, slipping into my uniform, fixing my hair, and
      finally attempting to wake up Shiki, still asleep on the top bunk. I try
      and try to call her name but it is fruitless; she doesn’t budge an inch.
      It’s her fault for sleeping so late after me; and yet despite the fact
      that she slept at such an ungodly hour she somehow never found the time to
      slip out of the uniform robes and into some sleeping attire. Still, I
      don’t think it matters to her really, since she never seems to complain
      about whether it’s warm or cool. She grinds her teeth for a few seconds
      under the blanket that covers her entirely. How annoying. Otherwise, she
      sleeps as still as a statue, and so I write waking Shiki up as a lost
      cause and give up. Our objective to observe hasn’t changed. The incident
      with Misaya Ōji was an unnecessary encounter, and though we now know who
      the culprit is, there’s no need for me and Shiki to go around trying to
      eliminate or capture her. Besides, I don’t think Misaya Ōji is still at a
      dormitory at this point. When I tried to check up on where she was
      yesterday, just before night fell, the answer I got was that she had filed
      a formal report to leave the school for winter break that morning. In
      other words, as far as the school was concerned, she wasn’t on Reien
      grounds anymore (though obviously, at least until our encounter, that was
      false). If she’s smart, she’ll follow through on that report and leave,
      and she won’t try to come into contact with me or Shiki ever again. Still,
      she was driven to accomplish something here, and something tells me that
      despite my conciliatory attitude toward her, and the last chance to
      withdraw that she gave me, she’ll try again. It’s hard to imagine her
      showing up herself and attacking us sometime today, but they do say that
      third time’s the charm. Just in case, I grab my magical tool of choice: a
      glove made out of salamander skin, used to channel my Art. I tuck it in my
      pocket securely and head out of the room. Outside in the corridor, the
      temperature is practically freezing, and I find that I have to keep moving
      if I want my body to stay warm. I pay a visit to some of the rooms of the
      class D students, but most of them are already out of their rooms. The few
      individuals I do meet aren’t of any help. Most of them seem out of it,
      never meeting your eyes, and like in some kind of lethargy. I would have
      believed that they were all taking some kind of strong narcotic if not for
      their sudden and ready refusal to talk to me. Their eyes suddenly take on
      a glint of mixed fear and disdain. Had Shiki been with me and been able to
      keep their boiling hostility in check, it might not have been so bad. But
      I don’t think I would have been able to talk to them like that alone, so
      that seems like a lost cause as well. I give up trying to talk to them for
      now. I relocate from the dormitories to the main school building, asking
      some of the instructors questions, but while they were kind enough to
      entertain me, they were all similarly unhelpful. Feeling like I’ve wasted
      my time, I head back to the dormitory to my room to regroup and rethink
      all the information I already have. I go in to find Shiki still sleeping
      persistently. Her eyes twitch for a moment, and I hope for a second that
      she’s already waking up. But after a few more moments of waiting, I
      realize she’s just in REM sleep. Disappointed, I sit down on the chair in
      front of my desk and think. The information I got from perusing Kaori
      Tachibana’s infirmary documents yesterday was enlightening. The fact that
      class D’s PE consisted mostly of field trips wasn’t so important. It’s a
      common enough event in Reien, and even the school nurse said as much. The
      useful portion came when I compared the dates of her physical examinations
      and the class field trips. I don’t know how it goes in other schools, but
      seeing as its important medical knowledge in all of Reien’s students, the
      school keeps a record of each student’s menstrual cycles. What I found out
      was that she was able to go on the class field trip on the time when she’s
      usually excused from doing so because of her period, and when I asked the
      school nurse, she said that she was certain that Kaori Tachibana had
      reported a late period. She also assured me that it was merely stress that
      was responsible, but that’s only because she doesn’t know the
      circumstances surrounding the girl. Her period being late might only be
      one part of the story, a conclusion all too easily reached when she never
      had the opportunity to have another one seeing as she died the next month.
      She might never have had a period at all in the month of October. The most
      obvious reason might also be the answer: pregnancy. At first, the period
      doesn’t come, but then the quickening in her stomach would have felt more
      real each passing day. From September to November, she must have driven
      herself into a corner, mentally speaking. After all, in Reien Girl’s
      Academy, getting pregnant seems to be considered a sin quite above murder.
      It means that at one point, you willingly exited the school without
      permission, went out into town, and for one reason or another, had sex
      with someone; a situation that would surely make the Mother Superior or
      any of the sisters faint were it told to them. And of course, with their
      very strict and conservative Catholic upbringing, I’m fairly sure Kaori
      Tachibana’s parents would have never forgiven her. There was truly no way
      out for her. An abortion would require her to go to a hospital, but the
      doctors would definitely report it to both the school and her parents. I’m
      willing to bet she didn’t know any unlicensed or quack doctors, and would
      be very hesitant to submit herself to their treatment. And so she spent
      those few weeks living like a criminal on death row, scared everyday of
      her stomach growing large enough to be noticeable. If I believe what
      Misaya Ōji had to say about Tachibana, though, I find it hard to believe
      that such a girl who so intensely follows the traditional Catholic way
      would be in that kind of relationship. “Rape then? Hayama Hideo, for a
      certainty,” I whisper to myself. Who else could it be? And it fits the
      circumstances. Did he rape Kaori Tachibana, and upon learning she was
      pregnant, kill her by setting fire to the dormitory building, seeking to
      simultaneously destroying the evidence and make it look like an accident?
      It’s a sketchy thought, but it seems to fit the man. There’s still another
      thing to consider. The nurse said that Kaori Tachibana was very stressed
      out, and I don’t think it’s an assessment entirely without meaning. I’ve
      observed before that class D seemed to be hiding something, and my talk
      with Fumio Konno confirmed as much. “She was being harassed,” I venture.
      That’s entirely possible. After all, she was constantly the highest scorer
      in the class, and is the only member of the class that got promoted from
      Reien’s junior high instead of transferring in. That’s the kind of natural
      environment that bullying is born from. But what about the class
      president? Fumio Konno didn’t seem like the sort of girl to permit that
      sort of business to occur and turn a blind eye to it. If even she had to
      ignore Tachibana’s plight, there must have been some truly compelling
      reason to do so. “Like the class knowing about the pregnancy.” That would
      have been enough of a reason. Enough for me to envision Fumio Konno
      deciding to just have nothing to do with it. And Tachibana, the poor girl,
      couldn’t even talk to the nuns who were supposed to support her. Enough of
      a reason for Tachibana Kaori to commit suicide in that fire. And class D,
      feeling that they have some dark secret to protect, keep their reticent
      behavior for the entire school. “Something’s missing,” I whisper, but I
      can’t seem to think what exactly. It’s easy to sit here and couple
      fragmented, limited information with personal insight, but turning that
      into a viable and supported conclusion is quite another task entirely.
      That’s the kind of thing Mikiya thrives in. At least he knows how to
      gather information, and how to get people to talk, like a police
      detective. Compared to him, I’m just the crazy wannabe PI that keeps
      throwing out ideas with only a modicum of factual basis. I always really
      hated those characters in detective fiction that always had the right
      guess, with their only excuse being that “it’s possible,” as if they were
      somehow above the normal person, above even the police detectives that the
      books always portrayed as weak and ineffectual, when in reality, the
      converse is true. I know how police detectives work. My cousin Daisuke is
      one, and I’ve had more than an earful from him. The police detective’s job
      is to strain an entire desert for the single grain of a gem, to give form
      and shape to a past that he wasn’t privy to, and in real life, this
      sometimes takes months, even years of grueling work. The detectives of
      fiction, at least to my understanding, abandon the process, miss the
      desert and the clues it gives, in favor of a short-sighted conclusion.
      Between the real detectives, the average men and women in police
      departments all over the world, who take all the clues they can get and
      try to speak for those who died, and the fictional detectives who take the
      flash of inspiration they get and bandy it as truth; the latter is more
      trapped by his own folly, and if he were real, he would be always alone in
      his suppositions beyond normal ken. It’s quite ironic then, that I find
      myself in that very same position now. I have neither the time of months
      to work a case like cousin Daisuke, nor the same resources available to
      him. So it is with a great regret that I realize that I’ve donned the role
      of that which I hate. I sigh, realizing I’m at my wits’ end, and lean back
      on my chair heavily before looking at the wall clock. It’s already near
      noontime, and the sky outside the window still persists in being cloudy.
      If anything, they’ve only darkened, and will almost certainly mean rain
      later. As I think this, a knock comes from the door, and then a voice.
      “Miss Kokutō, are you there?” It’s one of the sisters. “Yes, I am present.
      Is there something the matter?” I say as I open the door. “There is a
      phone call for you. Your brother.” As soon as I hear this, I excuse myself
      and walk with as much haste as I dare toward the lobby. The lobby is
      deserted when I arrive, which I am thankful for when I pick up the
      receiver. “Hello?” I say, maybe a bit too eagerly. “Hello, Shiki?” It’s a
      good thing I can’t see the frown on my face. “Unfortunately, Shiki is
      still asleep. Mmm, so you’d call all the way to Reien just to talk to your
      girlfriend, Mikiya?” I say with a cold voice. On the other end of the
      line, Mikiya clears his throat. “I didn’t say that. I called to ask about
      how things are going over there.” “You shouldn’t worry. After all, I did
      say some time ago how you shouldn’t be involved in these things.” I raise
      my voice only slightly, as if it were an interrogative. “Ah, here we go,”
      he says, clearly expecting the subject. “It’s not as if I wanted to be
      involved. But you expect me to ignore the entire thing when you and Shiki
      are neck deep in it?” I wanted to give him a definite yes straight out,
      but that would have been too blunt, and so I hold off on it. “Fine, fine.
      So, what is the purpose of this call? Are you planning to talk to Shiki or
      me?” “Well, Shiki was the one that asked me, but I think it’d be better if
      I told you. I’ve found some stuff on Hideo Hayama and Satsuki Kurogiri.
      Wanna hear it?” Huh. Shiki never told me about that. I’d chide her for not
      consulting me first if it wasn’t a pretty good move. Still… “Oh, Shiki
      told you to do it, did she? Even though she promised that she wouldn’t
      make you do anything dangerous? I knew she hasn’t learned. It’s clear that
      she doesn’t care about your well-being if she told you to perform such a
      dangerous task. Perhaps you should finally consider breaking up with her.”
      Even I’m surprised by what I end up saying, but predictably, it doesn’t
      faze Mikiya one bit. In fact, he even laughs. “Nah, Azaka, she just has a
      very…unique way of showing how worried she is.” His voice on the other end
      sounds so pleased, and I wonder what it is that has him so happy. “Anyway,
      I’m going to bring up the file on the two Shiki asked about.” I can hear
      the faint noise of pages being flipped on the other end. A thick file,
      from the sound of it, and if I know Mikiya, very well arranged to boot.
      While he’s searching through it, I ask him a question. “Where are you
      right now, Mikiya?” “Miss Tōko’s office. She’s out right now though.
      Meeting with cousin Daisuke. I’m stuck on watch duty over here,” he says
      morosely. “Wait a minute, you mean our cousin Daisuke?!” “Keep your voice
      down on the phone, will you? And yes, yes, it’s him.” Daisuke Akimi is my
      father’s little brother, technically our uncle. Since he’s the youngest of
      his siblings, he’s very near our age, and we call him cousin as a joke.
      He’s very close to Mikiya, enough so that someone watching them that
      doesn’t know better would almost call them brothers. “Apparently he’s an
      acquaintance of Miss Tōko’s,” Mikiya explains. “When we met in New Year
      and I told him about where I work, he shouted ‘but that’s Tōko Aozaki,
      ain’t it!’ and that was that. I think he’s out on a date with Miss Tōko
      right now. She was like ‘how could I refuse an offer from Kokutō’s
      cousin,’ and then left me in charge of the place.” This must be wrong on
      some level. Even Mikiya sounds displeased by it. So he was Miss Tōko’s
      contact inside the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department the entire time.
      If I think about it, it isn’t really surprising for him. He’s a member of
      the Criminal Investigation Section’s first squad, plainclothesmen that
      have had a lot of experience on foot, on patrol and in investigation, and
      so have some of the best street-level contacts in the entire CIS. And even
      within this group, cousin Daisuke is known as quite talented and driven,
      but also arrogant and having a disdain for authority. Exactly the kind of
      person that Miss Tōko would run into, in other words. “Anyway, he’s not
      the reason I called,” Mikiya continues. “Before I get back to Hideo
      Hayama, I gotta ask, have you ever talked to the guy?” I hear the worry in
      his voice, and I realize immediately what he’s really asking. “No. No, I
      haven’t. I know what kind of person Hideo Hayama is, for the most part.”
      He sighs, relieved. With slight hesitation, he begins. “Alright, here
      goes. I’ve been working the commercial district and asking some of the
      people in the vice squad through cousin Daisuke, and what I’ve heard isn’t
      pretty. The truth is that Hideo Hayama was pimping out his students, with
      clients paying for their company. He’d take the students out, probably on
      the pretense of a trip, and make them do it.” I catch myself inhaling
      sharply. I was prepared for the worst, but I honestly didn’t think it
      would be anywhere near that. Either Mikiya didn’t hear me, or he ignored
      me. Either way, he carries on with the report. “I’m not clear on the
      details, but you know how much students go in the prostitution arena. And
      they’re Reien students too, which makes them rare, and the guy knew that
      too. He was good. Charged high, but not high enough to make people stingy.
      He’d take them out every two times a week, and judging from the numbers,
      only a few in the class didn’t go regularly. I don’t know if he was bold
      or reckless, but he ran a pretty tight ship. Downtown, he was a popular
      name once, on account of his being flashy and acting like a big spender.
      He took it further and further every day, and ended up owing something big
      to a bar, which in turn was owned by some yakuza group. Of course, they
      wanted to collect. With little options, he turned to Reien, where his
      estranged brother was the chairman of the board, and I assume he pleaded
      with him to give him a teaching job there. I’m sure he made his excuses,
      forged his licenses, and eventually got in. Whether he was planning on
      starting a student prostitution ring right from the start, or he got the
      idea later, I don’t truly know, but the fact is that he turned it into his
      thing pretty fast. And since Reien’s students are largely daughters of
      rich or influential families, they fetch a pretty price on the street. I
      heard at first that it was only one student, but the yakuza put the
      pressure on him, and soon enough he was bringing all of them out. That’s
      most of the important things, I guess.” Then Mikiya tells me the names of
      the students involved, the dates when they went out, and even the rough
      estimates of the time they went back. He even got some details on the
      yakuza organization the entire operation was connected to, and I know how
      hard that can be to ferret out. “It’s a shame that most of this is
      unreliable testimony and can’t be used as proof. Take from that what you
      will,” he says disappointedly. He’s correct in his assessment. The police
      certainly can’t move on something as little as this, and the vice squad
      people he contacted are probably building their own case to take the
      entire thing down all at once. Though Kaori Tachibana’s pregnancy made the
      entire thing big enough such that even Reien couldn’t possibly have the
      power to make it disappear, the connection was weak, and the parents of
      the students were certainly powerful enough (some of them probably
      financially involved and invested enough in the yakuza) that they would
      see the investigation flounder and die a slow death if they ever got wind
      of it. “I’m sorry about all this, Azaka,” he says gloomily. Though the
      truth is still leaving me in quite a shock, I still find the awareness to
      give him a nervous “No problem.” But the truth only left us a truckload of
      problems. The secret that class D was protecting wasn’t Kaori Tachibana’s
      suicide, but this prostitution ring. Hideo Hayama couldn’t have kept it a
      secret alone. Even though he may have forced some of the students to go,
      the ones that went purely for pleasure and weren’t big fans of Reien’s
      abstinence policy must surely have used their influence to silence the
      entire class and keep the secret. For them, the temptation to seek
      something outside the regulation of the school was too much, and Hideo
      Hayama was their only key to that. But the confluence of factors that
      contribute to the entire problem doesn’t end with the people. To an
      extent, the severity of the institution can be partly to blame as well. It
      has its tall, ornate walls, the better to divorce it from anything that
      doesn’t belong in it already. The wind rarely sings inside, and not a
      sound from beyond the walls can be heard. Time proceeds at a languid,
      leisurely pace. All of it manufactured to provide some kind of proof
      against the perceived threat of defilement from what lies outside. But
      like any airtight room, eventually the air gets stale, becoming gross and
      fetid. The people here all think it’s some kind of secret world, warded
      against the other, harsher world. But it’s nothing more than a prison from
      the real. “So what led you to ask about Kaori Tachibana, Mikiya? You asked
      for her grades and everything.” I ask the last mystery I still have left
      for him. “The girl in the November fire, right? Remember back then we were
      in Miss Tōko’s office, and you told me about the fire in your dormitory
      for a while? Well, after work got a little lighter in December, I looked
      it up whenever I had free time. Started asking some authorities around.
      Eventually, cousin Daisuke hooked me up with the autopsy report for the
      deceased girl, our Kaori Tachibana. Apparently the cause of death is
      rather more ambiguous than what we may expect. The medical examiner
      apparently found some evidence that she may have died from heroin
      overdose, and she may have already been dead before the fire. But the
      final word on it is that it they couldn’t determine either way. The final
      weird note on her death is that there’s a good chance she might have been
      pregnant, though the state of the body left it officially unconfirmed.
      “They’re pretty sure, though, that no one led her to the fire to kill her.
      She was deep enough inside the building that anyone that might have taken
      her there wouldn’t have been able to get out. It’s a sad case for her.
      First the rape, then the pregnancy. Not the kind of thing you thrust on a
      sixteen year old girl, obviously; she probably couldn’t handle it all. Now
      this next one is just a guess but…I’m thinking when the fire started and
      everyone was rushing to get out of the dormitory, she’s the only one that
      stayed in her room. She might have actually wanted to die.” “Right,” I
      answer more evocatively than I should have. I can’t help myself. Kaori
      Tachibana’s case was all finally starting to take shape. “She has a motive
      for suicide established, I suppose. I wonder why she didn’t just have the
      baby aborted? If she had said it to Hayama, he might have considered it.”
      “Wouldn’t really know,” he answers with a curious voice. “Too young,
      maybe? Complications?” “Maybe,” I say lazily, thinking of something else.
      Her pregnancy was the reason Kaori Tachibana was harassed by class D, but
      not entirely out of the reason that it embarrassed the class. No. As long
      as she didn’t have an abortion, she threatened to spill the little secret
      that Hideo Hayama and the class had kept in the darkness. Worse, she
      didn’t even have to open her mouth for it to happen. The class probably
      didn’t even wait on the word from Hideo before they started ostracizing
      Kaori. No physical harm, though. That would have garnered the attention of
      the sisters sooner or later, which was the last thing they wanted. So for
      three months, she carried her perceived disgrace and endured the scorn of
      her class, a mental brand of torture. And then suicide, after the burden
      proved too great. “What an incompetent thing to do. If she was so ready to
      die, then she would have found the pregnancy a much easier ordeal. That
      hopeless little girl…,” I find myself losing my pace for a moment with an
      unwanted hiccup before recovering. “Throwing out everything she’s worked
      for to just die. She’s been here since she was a child, and she lost to
      someone like Hayama. How—” I choke on my last words, as I finally realize
      what I’m blurting out. I close my eyes, willing the tears not to come out.
      I put a hand on my forehead, thankful that there is no one else in the
      lobby to see me. “Losing? Azaka, what are you talking about? This wasn’t
      some game, not some kind of competition with winners or losers. I swear…”
      he sighs, and my hand moves to my hair before I lean back on the wall.
      “And she may have committed suicide, but it’s probably not for the kind of
      reason you’re thinking of, not for her kind of upbringing.” Mikiya’s voice
      is tinged with some regret, though I don’t know truly if it’s directed at
      me or at the deceased Kaori. I gulp and think of my words carefully before
      asking. “Why do you say that? Don’t you think she committed suicide
      because her classmates were being so hard on her? She probably only saw
      the escape of death as the only recourse left to desperate individuals
      such as her. That’s the only meaning in her actions, isn’t it?” “Well, I
      wouldn’t expect you to understand,” he says. Something resonates in that
      statement. It’s almost the same thing that Misaya Ōji said to me only
      yesterday. “Why wouldn’t I?” “See, Kaori Tachibana’s been in Reien since
      she was a kid, right? She’s a very traditional, very conservative
      Catholic. In the Catholic faith, suicide is taken very seriously. It’s an
      old crime to them that not only insults the life you’ve been given, but
      also devalues the life you were supposed to live to earn salvation. It’s
      on the same footing as murder to them. For someone that identifies so much
      with the Catholic faith, Kaori Tachibana had a reason for suicide that,
      for her, probably goes beyond the rational.” What Mikiya says surprises
      me, eliciting a small gasp. I’d almost forgotten about Kaori’s religion.
      Unlike the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth in Buddhism, Christianity
      promised salvation in the afterlife. I knew that, of course, but for
      someone like me who only attended the masses and morning services as a
      student and not a believer, the fact held little more weight to it than
      any other English word. But to someone like Kaori, who’s zeal and ardor
      for the Catholic faith had defined her since childhood, they were all she
      had in this school. The prospect of suicide to her must have been more
      fearful than the fact of death could ever have been. “And that reason
      being?” I ask. The answer to questions such as these does not come easily
      to me at all. Mikiya is fond of saying that my drive for competitiveness
      has burned out at least some of my empathy. Sometimes, he smiles, saying
      it’s a joke. At times, like in my outburst earlier, I think I often prove
      him true. “Atonement, maybe. She took in her sins, and the sins of her
      classmates, and sacrificed herself to erase the sins of class D, so that
      she alone falls into the Christian hell. She tried to redeem everyone.” I
      say nothing, letting silence settle in for a moment. I cannot expect you
      to understand what that truly implies. That was what Misaya Ōji said. Her
      anger was real. She had understood Kaori better than anyone else, and
      because of that, she cannot find it in herself to forgive class D, little
      changed from the incident. Killing them is no guarantee that they will be
      sent to the pits of hell where they rightfully belong. She was right. In
      Misaya Ōji’s mind at least, killing them wouldn’t mean that they get sent
      to hell. It wouldn’t be the proper punishment for the people that had made
      Kaori Tachibana fall. That’s why she hounds them, unseen, all this time.
      There is no forgiveness left for them. Only the proposition of a death so
      horrid that all would have to see it.
