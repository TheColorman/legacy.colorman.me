    </h1>
    <p>
      At the moment, the city is knee deep into the worst snow it’s had in four
      years, and to make matters worse, it’s falling in March. The volume of the
      snow is so thick, and the temperature so low, that no one at all would be
      surprised to see the entire city frozen in place. Even at nights, the
      white spots drift down onto the roofs and streets in a languid pattern,
      showing no signs of abating, like the sky is determined to drown it in a
      new ice age. Tonight, at midnight, is one such frigid night. Not even the
      shadow of a person can be sighted on the streets tonight, and the
      unceasing white veil of the snow is permeated only by the illumination of
      street lights. It should be dark, but even the darkness can’t resist being
      tainted by the gathering white. In that scene of contrasts can be seen one
      boy, strolling through the late hours. He has no particular purpose in
      mind. Something called him out here, a premonition that promised something
      in a place so familiar. He walks casually, as if time didn’t truly matter,
      holding aloft his black umbrella as he presses his way through the thick
      snowfall. And at last, he finally chances upon the girl, standing there,
      just as she did four years ago. Dressed in her kimono in the midst of the
      desolate white night, the girl stares blankly at the void. And like four
      years ago, the boy calls out to her in a voice at ease. “Hey.” The girl in
      the kimono turns slowly to glance over her shoulder, and smiles sweetly.
      “Good evening, Kokutō. It has been quite a while now, hasn’t it?” asks the
      strange girl, Shiki Ryōgi, as the gentle smile on her lips speaks of a
      past where he had known the boy so long ago. The voice, however, is
      cordial, not intimate. The boy looks at her, seeing the appearance of the
      Shiki he knows, but it is not her. Not the long-gone Shiki either. This
      one is someone else completely. “I knew it’d be you. I had a feeling we’d
      meet each other again here. Shiki’s asleep now, isn’t she?” “You may call
      it such. The words now must be for you and me.” The lazy smile lingers on
      the corners of her lips. “So who are you, really?” the boy inquires. “I am
      me. Two individuals named Shiki reside within, but I am not either one. I
      am the one that resides in the hollow between two hearts, two minds, two
      souls. Or perhaps it can be said that I am that hollow.” Her hand brushes
      lightly upon her breast as she closes her eyes, almost in prayer. “That
      which is discordant. That which is hated. That which is intolerable.
      Accept these things and all others, and never know pain. But there is
      another, in turn. That which is harmonious. That which is desired. That
      which is permitted. Reject these things and all others, and know nothing
      but pain.” The boy realizes that she is talking of what Shiki was, once
      before, when both and Shiki existed at the same time inside of her. “One
      affirms, one denies,” the strange girl continues. “She is complete, but
      isolated. Alone. Don’t you agree? A single color, perfect and unsullied,
      is only so because it was not joined with others. It cannot change,
      forever remaining the same color. That was what they were. Two opposites,
      sprung from the singular primal origin. The gulf between them is empty. As
      such, it is where I dwell.” “So why call me out then, here of all places,
      Shiki? Oh, mind if I call you ‘Shiki?’” The boy’s head is titled, showing
      confusion, but the girl seems to think nothing of it. “Not at all,” she
      replies. “Shiki Ryōgi is my name, after all. I would be pleased if you
      called me by my name. Perhaps it may give me meaning after so long.” There
      is something about her voice, thinks the boy, that strikes him as both
      childlike and adult. They talked like that for some time, whiling away the
      minutes with meandering and fleeting talk: The boy talking to her with a
      sort of familiarity, and the girl listening closely with an air of vague
      bemusement, as though nothing had truly changed. In a sense, nothing had.
      Though the girl knew that she was so hopelessly different from the boy.
      “So let me get this straight. Shiki doesn’t remember what happened on this
      road four years ago?” the boy asks abruptly. That was the time, he
      remembers, when they were both still high school students. He remembered
      that he had asked when they had met again in the school, that they had met
      before. had only answered that she couldn’t remember. “I am afraid not. I
      am different from her. and Shiki were two sides of the same coin, and
      their memories were twinned together. But I am a separate existence from
      either of them, so Shiki will not remember what words pass between us
      tonight.” “I see,” he mutters with a hint of disappointment. It was on
      March 1995 when he met her. They chanced upon each other on this road, on
      a day of cold snowfall just like today, when both were on the cusp of
      entering high school. He had been on his way home that night when he
      spotted a lone girl on the sidewalk, standing still and staring up at the
      twinkling stars. His plans to go home and sleep were temporarily
      forgotten, when he greeted her with a simple “Good evening,” as if he were
      greeting a good and old friend. The snow was just as beautiful then as
      they are now, enough for two complete stranger’s paths to cross. “In
      truth, there is something else I must ask you, Kokutō. Sadly, it will be
      the most important, the most final of questions I can ever ask you. It is
      to that purpose that I have revealed myself tonight.” The girl stares into
      the boy with eyes that belie the age that her appearance would imply.
      “What is it you desire?” she asks gently. The question comes as a surprise
      to the boy, and he struggles at first for words of reply. The girl keeps
      her mechanical, almost amused expression on her face. “Make your wish,
      Kokutō. The wishes of people are a trivial thing, and it seems Shiki has
      taken quite the peculiar liking to you, so I grant you this one privilege.
      What is it you desire?” she repeats. The girl extends a hand toward the
      boy, her eyes a transparent well, drinking deeply of the void-like sky, as
      if it looked out over a vast abyss that knows no end, and it is reflected
      back in those delicate eyes, separated from the common thinking of
      humanity. It was like looking into the eyes of some god. “I don’t know…”
      he answers, his voice trailing off and becoming little as he takes a
      moment to ponder. He looks into her eyes, not in disinterest, but in
      something approaching faith. “I suppose…I don’t really need one,” he
      finally answers with a certainty. “Yes,” she whispers disappointedly,
      almost like a sigh. But there is a shadow of relief in it as well. “Yes, I
      suppose I knew you would say that.” Her eyes part themselves from the boy
      and returns to the white darkness where she seems more comfortable. “How
      could you know, if you aren’t really Shiki?” he asks, amused. The girl
      only replies with an appreciative sidelong glance and an acknowledging
      nod. “Indulge me, then. Tell me where in a man his character lies,” she
      suddenly asks, as casually as asking about something no more trivial than
      tomorrow’s weather, as if she knew any answer the boy could give would not
      surprise her in the least. And yet, the boy puts a hand on his chin, and
      tries to look the scholar. “Well, if I had to give an answer, I
      suppose…well no doubt it’s connected to sentience and sapience, so it’s a
      matter of the mind, I guess.” The doubt in his voice is clear as day. Not
      surprisingly, the girl shakes her head slowly. “No. The soul dwells in our
      memory, and it in turn animates us. But it does not mean that it need only
      be fed with electricity to continue its dream of fragile reality, deprived
      of a body that houses it. The mage that Shiki once met spoke as you did,
      that a man’s character is in the mind. A mistake. You, your character, and
      your very soul is shaped by travails, given form in your body. A
      personality does not arise whole-formed from just a mind and the sentience
      that accompanies it. It is through our bodies, allowing us access to all
      these visceral experiences, that we take our steps into precious
      self-awareness, and where we form our characters as extroverts, or
      introverts, or any number of other archetypes. A ‘personality’ shaped by
      sentience alone cannot hope to even reflect on what it is. Such a thing is
      more akin to a calculator, I should think. If there is no personality,
      then it becomes necessary to create one, starting from the very beginning.
      “Yet rather than the body arising from the existence of sentience, the
      body is crafted well before the emergence of any kind of sentience. But
      the body alone carries no sense of sapience. The body is simply there. But
      even within such a simple thing, something drives it, something that
      connects it to a primal origin. I grew from such origins, born from
      sentience, raised alongside the other two.” The boy nods. He’s heard of
      this before; that there are three things any human must have to live: the
      psyche, the soul, and the body. This girl then, was Shiki’s true nature,
      what mages had called the origin of a person. A thing of nothingness, of
      void, the primal nature of someone. The girl casts her eyes downwards,
      looking as though she had read the boy’s thoughts exactly. “Such is what I
      am, a character produced not from the mind but the body, wholly different
      from or Shiki, who arose from her fractured psyche. I am the power behind
      them, but I am powerless before them. She is the embodiment of the ryōgi,
      of two extremes, the symbol of yin and yang given form, a great continuum
      of dynamism and entropy. I am of the empty boundary in between, the
      channel that allowed both to have united thoughts. I am their beginning,
      and I am their end, connecting them to the spiral of origin. Without me,
      they would have been nothing but fractured and sundered existences.” The
      girl smiles a deadly smile, tinged with something approaching a cold taste
      for blood. “Don’t be surprised if I say I can barely follow,” the boy
      mentions, “but I guess the way I’m getting it is that you’re the one that
      made the existence of two Shikis possible.” “The essence of it, I suppose.
      The origin that never reveals itself. In truth, I should have withered
      away long ago, an unneeded and alien part of the body. My origin is
      emptiness, and I would never have claimed intelligence or any grander
      meaning. But it was the Ryōgi dynasty had other plans. They wove their
      meager Arts and gave me sentience. and Shiki arose just as much from the
      need to protect myself as from their experiences.” and Shiki; yin and
      yang; virtue and vice. The boy remembers the mage Tōko Aozaki saying to
      him once before: that they were separated not by conflict but by utility;
      the desire for the Ryōgi dynasty to pursue its mysterious ambition. “What
      a perilously unwise game they play, these dynasties,” the girl continues.
      “I should have died before I was ever free of the womb, but instead, they
      gave me a sense of self. You see, any animal comes into the world with a
      body and sapience worthy of each other, but I, born of the origin of
      nothingness, must needs die. I should have never existed for long. Tōko
      told you of this, did she not? Of reality’s uncanny ability to fight what
      is irrational, and unnatural, solely through consensus. Produced from such
      an unnatural origin as nothingness, I would have petered out
      unceremoniously before ever achieved an iota of consciousness. But the
      Ryōgi dynasty had spells that bid me awake, and so I did, and the origin
      awoke in as well. Through it, I could see the material reality. I found it
      too boring, however, and passed that responsibility to . Can you not see?
      How everything in this reality is so predictable, and how the rules that
      bind it are so weak and mutable?” Her eyes are simple and innocent, and
      yet they seem to almost laugh cruelly and mockingly at everything. “But
      even you have your own will,” states the boy, looking at the girl almost
      pitiably now. The girl nods and says, “Indeed. Not so large a surprise.
      All have an origin that carries some small spark of intelligence, but it
      never comes to fore at the beginning of life. It is the mind of a person
      that must carry that first burden, and transmute that along with the body
      to a personality. Thus does the little intelligence of the origin lose
      meaning and fade. Yet a man’s personality, knowing nothing of the body
      that made it whole, will assume in his ignorance that his personality
      formed from sentience alone. The order seemed to be wholly different in my
      case, however. Still, at least I can thank Shiki for our little chat
      tonight. Without memories to tap into, I might not have understood words
      let alone hold a conversation. I would just be a little spark, worth next
      to nothing.” “I see. So without Shiki, you wouldn’t be able to perceive
      the outside world because—” “Because I am but a simple mechanism operating
      on the instructions of something inside me, yes. Just a vessel with sight
      turned inward, a body connected to death and entropy, and what mages call
      The Akashic Record, or the spiral of origin. A worthless connection, as
      far as I’m concerned.” She takes a single, small step forward, extends her
      hand and lightly touches upon the boy’s left cheek as light as a feather.
      Her pale fingers brush back the bangs, revealing the vicious scar beneath.
      “At this moment, however, it may prove of use. I can make this wound
      disappear. I would be able to help someone, and make some kind of
      difference in the world. But you said you needed no wish.” “That’s right.
      I know Shiki better for destroying things, and it feels sort of weird and
      just a bit suspicious for you to be asking.” The boy gives a plain smile,
      not truly knowing himself how serious that statement is. The girl turns
      away from him then, as one would turn away from glaring sunlight, and
      retreats her hand, holding it close to her chest. “An understandable
      observation. Shiki is very much a creature of destruction. I suppose you
      still cannot see me as anything else but her, in the end. My origin is
      emptiness, and because of this, Shiki can see the death of everything.
      When Shiki slept for two years, her senses shattered and dead, she gazed
      into the emptiness inside her for so long that she came to know the
      welcoming embrace of death. Shiki floated on the vast abyss of the spiral
      of origin, alone inside the void, where she awoke. And no matter how much
      she denied it, her soul called out to that base drive, that voice inside
      her that told her that she could kill. Her power stemmed from that. Much
      like Fujino Asagami, her Arcane Eyes made her play an entirely different
      game than common men. Her Eyes expressed their connection to the spiral of
      origin through death, calling forth the destined entropy of all things and
      manifesting it. But my connection to it is far more profound. And it
      allows me to see everything so…differently.” The way she says this last
      word was a mixture of delight and sadness, and the boy got the distinct
      sense that even though she explains, she knows her words would never truly
      reach anyone. “The spiral of origin is the primordial beginning of all
      things in this pattern of reality. All things pass through the great
      wheel, their natures and their histories—past, present, and future—are
      connected to it. It is thus a vast and empty place. It reflects what I am,
      in a way. I am connected to it, and I am a part of it as well. I am it.
      Which is why the greatest feats that mages can only dream of are allowed
      me. I can change the very structure of elementary particles. I can
      transmute evolution itself, changing everything into something wholly
      different. All creation dances to the tune of magic and the melody of the
      arcane Art. I can bend the rules of this lie of a reality, this prison
      that keeps so many minds in sleep. I can break it as easily as a twig. I
      can remake this world. I can unmake it. I can make a new one whole cloth.”
      And, as if seeking the most inappropriate punctuation to her statement,
      she giggles slightly, a snicker of contempt as sinister as her smile. “But
      there is no meaning in such feats. The destruction of lies is tiring work,
      and I find it no different from dreaming. And so I choose to see nothing,
      to think nothing, to live in dreamless slumber and in self-imposed
      quiescence. A decidedly different dream than Shiki had, clearly. The girl
      is so transparent sometimes, don’t you think so? I see right through her,
      just as I do with everything. Her, reality…even myself.” Her voice becomes
      a whisper in the infinite night, her eyes affixed to it with such an
      intensity, it feels as if she would never have the chance to see its like
      again. Perhaps she never will. “But what can I do?” she asks herself. “I
      am but a body, bound to her dream. Hers is the material, and mine the
      soul, sharing a body connected to the great Akasha. I know everything that
      has passed and will pass, and it is a bitter, meaningless tedium, enough
      to close your eyes to the entire affair. And so it will be as before. I
      shall sleep, undreaming, unthinking, in eternity. I pray only that when
      entropy claims this body, that the dream live on, and I with it.” Snow
      falls tranquilly upon her words with the weight of a burial. The boy says
      nothing, looking only at the side of the girl’s face as she looks up and
      over the night. Noticing this, the girl speaks in a restrained voice, but
      almost scolding. “Silly isn’t it? It is nothing to fret over, I assure
      you. But having you hear this makes me happy enough to tell you one more
      thing. Shiki misunderstands herself. She has never truly loved murder. Her
      impulse stems from me, her origin. So fear her not, Kokutō. She is no
      murderous monster. Only me. Always me.” The grin, never far from her face,
      seems to say to the boy in slight and sly motions that it is a secret kept
      between them only. The boy is left to puzzle out how anyone would believe
      him anyway. How can he tell anyone a secret kept between himself and a
      soul, born from primal intelligence? Who would even believe him? “I must
      leave soon, I fear,” the girl says. “I ask again, Kokutō, do you wish for
      nothing? Even in when you crossed paths with Leo Shirazumi, you chose the
      path of temperance, and didn’t waver from it until the end, when the
      choice to be made was clear. It is a wholly strange choice, I must
      declare. Do you not want something better than this?” “Nah. Here, right
      here, like this…it’s fine, I think.” “Maybe it is,” the girl whispers. She
      looks at him then with almost envious eyes, and she thinks. Humans tear
      and scrabble for answers, creating a never-ending spiral of conflict.
      Shiki Ryōgi personifies this. And yet here is this boy, of a character
      that puzzles the girl. Hurting no one, even himself, taking nothing, and
      asking for nothing. He stands amidst the battering winds and waves,
      melting into the flow of time as his own until he breathes his last. A
      common life. Could it be possible to live such a life? Surely not from the
      start. Perhaps that too is some different kind of “special.” So in the
      end, everyone is still distinct, leading lives whose meaning comes
      entirely from their own self. The seed is always the same, but it is they
      who chart different courses, becoming margraves of their own empty
      boundaries, guarding their own normality. Sometimes, across borders,
      people reach out, sometimes they don’t. And yet they live. There is a long
      stillness from both the boy and girl. The great white expanse seems to
      call toward her as she ponders. No one will ever try to understand him, no
      one to ever give him the time of day. Always normal, no one to see into
      him deeply. Unhated, with no one to draw close to. And yet, to Shiki, a
      symbol of happy times. Who among them is truly alone? No one might ever
      truly say. The snowflakes drift about in the air, the girl as entranced as
      she has been the entire time. Yet in her eyes is a quiet regret. And then,
      she murmurs something under her breath, so silently that it almost seems
      as if it was meant only for her, and that it was never meant to escape her
      lips. “He will live ordinary, and die ordinary. What solitude,” says Shiki
      Ryōgi, as she stares out at the darkness that holds no beginning and no
      end, words of parting barely heard. The boy saw the girl off, knowing that
      they will never meet again. The snow did not abate, burying the darkness
      in little white shards, fluttering gently like the wings of tired
      butterflies, falling to the ground. “Farewell, Kokutō,” the girl had said
      before she left. The boy could say nothing. “Silly me. I know we’ll meet
      again tomorrow,” the girl had said before she left. The boy could say
      nothing. And after that, for a long while, longer than he could say, he
      stood out there in the lonely street, looking out into the winter night
      sky. It was only when dawn broke that he concluded his vigil in place of
      the girl. Yet here, even with blue-yellow light peeking out of the
      horizon, the snow does not weaken or cease. And when it seemed like the
      whole world would be buried in white, he finally started to make his way
      home, each step a crunch of snow crust underfoot. The black umbrella sways
      in the long path, the boy holding it aloft the sole shadow that plies the
      way. In the midst of white winter, the black-clad figure is the only thing
      that contrasts the day. And it sways slowly, shuffling from side to side
      with each step, until alone, it becomes difficult to spot. There is no
      loneliness that darkens his step, and the boy does not stop on the path.
      All is as it was before, as it was four years ago, when he met her for the
      first time in this path. Two lone figures, sharing a solitary road, their
      souls cold and sweet and tinged with the songs of winter.
