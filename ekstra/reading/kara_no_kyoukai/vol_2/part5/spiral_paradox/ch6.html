  <h1 class="title">Spiral Paradox - VI</h1>
  <p>
    In the time I wait for Shiki to come home, the city had taken on the
    appearance of its morning palette. The weather, however, seems content to
    return to the cloudy gray I thought it had thrown off yesterday. Not
    letting my worry eat away at me too much, I put it out of my mind as I
    head to the office. By the time I get there, it’s just past eight o’
    clock. I hold the little hope that Shiki might have just gone straight to
    work, but having been greeted by the sight of Miss Tōko sitting behind her
    desk alone with no one else in sight, even that hope is dashed. I quickly
    greet Miss Tōko when I come in, sit down behind my desk, and continue
    working on whatever I was working on yesterday. My mind wasn’t really into
    the work, and yet I still move like a machine, probably because I do
    almost the same thing every day. Such, I suppose, is the power of routine
    that it conquers even the possible work deficiency resulting from a
    worried mind such as mine. “Kokutō, about the data you gave me yesterday…”
    I hear Miss Tōko say from her desk in front of the window. “Right,” I
    reply languidly. “It’s about that high rise and its residents. You
    remember you were kind of miffed after only digging up stuff on thirty of
    the total fifty resident families, but that actually wraps it up. The
    remaining records don’t exist in the first place. That’s the reason you
    were only able to get their names and family trees, because those twenty
    families are pure fiction. I looked into it on my own time, but after
    thoroughly looking at what data I could recover four times over, I gave it
    up. They just reused the records of people and families that’ve been six
    feet under for years.” “Right,” I repeat. “And all of them are in the east
    building too. I don’t know what’s going...” she cuts herself off
    mid-sentence, suddenly frowning in annoyance as if ants are blazing a
    trail all over her skin. She only whispers one thing that brings me back
    to reality. “Someone’s coming.” She hastily pulls out something from a
    desk drawer that looks about the size of a ring that looks like it’s made
    out of grass, and then throws it towards my direction. “Keep holding that
    and stick to the wall,” she explains, wearing the furrowed brow that
    always denoted her worry. “Don’t wear it. Don’t draw attention to
    yourself. Don’t bump on anything. And not so much as a peep out of you. If
    you do it right, our uninvited guest will leave without even noticing
    you.” The tension that her words create makes me refrain from asking any
    questions, and caught up with the abruptness of the entire thing, I just
    end up following what she said. The ring doesn’t look like it’s been made
    particularly skillfully, but nevertheless I grasp it in my palm as hard as
    I can, as if this would artificially enhance whatever effect it’s supposed
    to bestow. I position myself on the wall behind the couch that Shiki often
    lies down on, and wait. It doesn’t take long for both of us to hear the
    distinct sound of footsteps. Climbing up the staircase of this unfinished
    building is an individual with an exaggerated cadence to his step—perhaps
    intentionally so. The steps don’t stop, but instead heads straight toward
    this office, and soon the individual in question steps through the
    entrance: a man clad in red. The man’s strikingly blonde hair and blue
    eyes immediately mark him as not native, and his sharp and well-defined
    features even less so. His movements are a showman’s: refined, practiced,
    and well-moderated amounts of the theatrical. I place his age at about the
    early twenties, and his nationality is obviously European, probably
    German. The red coat that adorns him only completes the image of him
    having stepped out of some Victorian era illustration. As soon as he
    enters, he raises a hand toward Miss Tōko in greeting. “A fine morning to
    you, Aozaki! It’s been too long. How have you been, my dear?” His
    ostentatious manner carries over even to his voice, which goes up and down
    in points he deems dramatic. The smile that he directs to Miss Tōko is one
    filled with familiarity, but I can’t see him as anything but serpentine in
    his actions. The man stops his pace directly before Miss Tōko’s desk.
    Seated behind her desk, she offers a cold glance at the man. “Cornelius
    Alba. What is the successor of the Sponheim Abbey doing so far from home,
    I wonder?” “Why, I would have imagined that to be obvious! To see you, of
    course! You were so helpful in our time together in London that I thought
    it was only fair to give you a warning. Or could it be that you find my
    kindness actually bothersome?” He spreads his arms wide in a welcoming
    gesture and smiles. The flamboyance of his princely conduct contrasts
    quite sharply with Miss Tōko, who continues to generate an atmosphere of
    barely concealed hostility. And yet, the man laughs right in front of her
    before he goes on with his explanation. “And besides, why not stay? After
    all, Japan is such a wonderful country. It’s modern yet has that isolated
    ‘Macondo’ feeling, precisely why the Ordo Magi tends to overlook it. They
    even have their own dynasties, and their own quaint traditions of the Art,
    like that Onmyōdō stuff, which I can’t really tell apart from Shintō, but
    whatever. The splendid thing about this Japanese lot is how they don’t
    intrude on your personal space, quite unlike the nosiness of the Ordo.
    When something disagreeable is happening, they don’t move to nip it in the
    bud, but instead clean up afterwards, like janitors. All the Japanese are
    the same way. Oh, but don’t misunderstand, I like that about them. It’s a
    situation so opposite from where I come from, and perfect for the
    apostates who have severed relations with the Ordo, of which I am a part
    of anyway, so perhaps this business is none of mine.” He laughs to bookend
    his elucidation, which is quickly becoming annoying. Still, I guess what
    Miss Tōko said is true. He doesn’t seem to be looking anywhere near my
    direction, nor noticing me in particular. Giving an angled glance at the
    young man who shot words out rapid-fire, Miss Tōko finally speaks. “If
    idle chatter is your objective here, then you can go out the same way you
    came in. You trespass on my sanctum, and I could kill you where you stand
    and no one would object.” “Ah, but you do not remember that you
    transgressed first by entering my sanctum, so my case against you has
    greater merit. You were in the company of someone else at the time, and I
    did not know whether he was of our traditions or not, so I held off on
    greeting you as a proper host would.” “So I was right about that high rise
    apartment building. If it was you who weaved the Art into that amateurish
    ward, then you might want to adjust your self-esteem…downwards.” Miss Tōko
    allows herself the subtlest smile, but the blonde-haired man does not take
    it humorously at all. “Can you not see its genius? We craft our sanctums
    and our chantries as a space separate from the consensus, and our wards
    serve the purpose of keeping the stupid masses of humanity out, further
    estranging us and our practices. You reinforce the ward further and
    further, build your walls higher, and eventually the Ordo is wise to you.
    Either way, someone will catch on, mage or no. But that apartment building
    is none of these things. Its nature is covert, our own little world where
    we can conduct our studies in peace, far from the worries of the consensus
    or the Ordo. And to my knowledge, only one man can do it, with a method
    far from the crude weavings of neophytes and pretenders.” “Oh, so you’re
    here for praise? For accolades? To prove that you’ve caught up to me and
    him?” Miss Tōko asks. “Well, if you want someone to vindicate your
    scholarly efforts, then I’ll indulge you. Congratulations, Cornelius
    Alba.” Her voice drips with sarcasm. “Don’t you dare dismiss me so easily,
    Aozaki. Alaya doesn’t even factor into my scale anymore. He has me to
    thank for the puppets in that building and the brains that I keep alive
    and well-functioning. Without me, he is nothing.” By now the man’s
    expression had converted into a parody of its former mirth, and the
    youthfulness he radiated when he walked through the door is all but gone,
    replaced by a menacing scowl. “Goodness, how our little boy has grown.
    Don’t kid yourself, Alba. Both of us are apostates to the Ordo, and our
    neophyte days are over. What are you really here for? If you’re just going
    to brag about your research then you can just throw it to the rabid
    fanclub you must surely have in excess.” “You never change, do you? Then
    let us dispense with conversation for now. Your sanctum is far too dull
    and droll for me. In time, you’ll find yourself back in that building, and
    perhaps there we can carry on a proper chat, in a more refined
    environment.” He pauses, both of them eyeing each other, before he says,
    “Aozaki, the Taijitu is ours.” Miss Tōko’s eyes twitch for a moment upon
    hearing the peculiar word. “Containing a Taijitu within itself? Do you
    really want to reach the spiral of origin so badly? You are complete fools
    if you think of yourselves as higher than other mages and can beat even
    the reach of the Deterrent.” “As I have said, there will be no
    interference from the Deterrent, or from the consensus from which its
    authority stems. This is not a new method we created, but just an old
    trick we never realized before. Still, we will be sure to watch our step.
    Don’t worry. Your Ryōgi will receive the utmost care and attention.” “What
    the hell have you done with Shiki?!” I suddenly find myself shouting,
    unable to contain myself as soon as I hear the name. Both of them turn to
    look at me at the same time, Miss Tōko’s face a picture of disappointment
    at my idiocy. The man in the red coat looks at me almost in disbelief. Ah,
    well, there’ll be plenty of time for berating myself later. After
    recovering from the apparent surprise, he smiles his widest smile yet.
    “You must be the boy from yesterday, tagging along with Aozaki here.” He
    turns back to Miss Tōko. “I had known you to be the kind not to take
    apprentices, but ah, here we have the proof to the contrary, don’t we?
    Splendid! Simply splendid! Certainly one more thing to be happy about!”
    With his arms gestured outwards like an opera singer, and the random
    shifts of his sing-song voice, I can’t rightly think of him as anything
    but the most peculiar man. “I suppose it would be pointless for me to say
    at this point that he’s not my apprentice?” Miss Tōko sighs, frustrated
    and with fingers brushing her forehead. “Now, if that’s all, then I thank
    you for sharing the information. I know the face rubbing simply must be
    done for your sake. But haven’t you thought I could report this to the
    Ordo?” “The bureaucracy of that organization works against itself. All the
    practical preparations they would have to do to get the permission of so
    and so will take six days at least, and another two to coordinate with the
    local chapters to even get so much as a pair of feet over here. Much, much
    slower than the Biblical God and his act of genesis, and so much one can
    do in such a span!” As an exclamation mark to his proclamation, he laughs
    so hard he bends over, unable to contain himself, making me feel uneasy.
    As he tires of it, he turns his back on us, the only trace of that laugh
    being the smile that bends the corners of his mouth. “Well then, I shall
    see you again soon, I hope. I know you have your own preparations to arm,
    but I will look forward to our next meeting.” The man then leaves, red
    coat flapping about from his boisterous movements, leaving us with the
    cheerful disposition on his face before he is out the door and disappears
    from view. “Ma’am, explain to me what the hell just happened?” Miss Tōko’s
    tension was gone the minute that man was out the door, and she returns to
    her customary laid back look. She even returns to her customary laid back
    answers. “Nothing. Just telling us a friendly neighborhood warning that
    they’ve captured Shiki, is all.” I’m at a loss at what to say to her,
    except ask her the question whose answer I think I can surmise from Miss
    Tōko and the red coated man’s conversation. “Where?” “Ōgawa Apartments,
    somewhere on the top floor most likely. If I follow the logic of their
    crazy rituals, then Shiki, as the yin, has to be in the west building.”
    From her breast pocket she produces a cigarette, which she then lights and
    takes a puff of as she stares lazily at the ceiling in seeming relief.
    Unfortunately, I’m not as keenly optimistic as she is. I can’t bring
    myself to believe the man in the coat when he said that Shiki is unharmed,
    but I can’t just sit here and not make sure if it’s true or not either. I
    head for the door with a quickened pace until Miss Tōko shouts, “Don’t.” I
    turn back to her. “Look, ma’am, I know it’s your policy not to get
    involved without money on the table, but—” “Oh, simmer down for a moment,
    would you?” she scolds, not really with displeasure so much as
    exasperation. “As a matter of fact, I do know who Shiki is, alright? I’ve
    had a feeling this day would come when I first met her in the hospital.
    This is just fate collecting on the debt I owe it that day. Kokutō, you
    don’t go into a mage’s chantry without a plan on how to fight him. Even
    Alba had to get past some nasty setups to even get up here, and you’ll
    have to do the same, except without the benefit of seeing them. Walk in
    there thinking you can wing it, and I can guarantee that you will come out
    in a form unrecognizable to most people before you’re even ten meters past
    the entrance.” When she explains that, the gravity of the implication that
    the weirdo in the red coat is just like Miss Tōko, with just as much
    hidden potential for manipulating reality in creative ways, finally begins
    to set in. “But what about yesterday? We were fine then, weren’t we?”
    “Because they thought you were just some regular guy. Didn’t I tell you
    before? Mages don’t use the Art on normal people unless they’re backed
    into a corner. You goof off, weave your spell like an amateur, and it’s
    more trouble for them than they probably know how to deal with. Make no
    mistake; Alba wants you dead as much as he does me.” “That’s true,” I say,
    thinking it over better now that I’m calmed down. “I suppose they could
    even just mess with my brain, or some other horrible stuff.” “Yes,” she
    nods, “and no. Messing with a brain is easy enough to do for a lot of
    mages who specialize in it. But it’s far from being in common use. The old
    “he’s crazy because fairies messed his shit up” excuse tends to not work
    anymore, since people tend to have social groups—family, friends, the
    social niche he belongs to—that investigates, traces it back somewhere.
    The more you conceal it with the Art, the more you draw attention to some
    weird shit going down in your general area, and you risk discovery each
    time. And besides, a spell isn’t permanent. It’s a constant fight between
    the spell you weave, and the will of the affected mind. Sometimes, their
    mind wins, and the person gets their memories back, and that’s bad luck
    for you.” She crushes the cigarette on the ashtray and leaves it there.
    She’s right, I realize it now. Things without explanation demand it, and
    the people will look for it, because those things are distinct only in
    that an explanation for them doesn’t exist. And if that blonde guy just
    started killing people it would just bring more eyes than anything. Add
    that to this new Internet thing going around, and it’s becoming easier and
    easier to track a person down, trace where he went. Which will lead them
    to the apartment building. Hence, its unassuming build, designed to make
    people feel as normal inside as they possibly can. Judging by his and Miss
    Tōko’s conversation, that Alba character can’t be up to any good in there,
    and yet he wouldn’t have touched the incident with the burglar or the
    dying woman who wandered into the building with a ten-foot pole, since to
    him, the police coming, checking things out, and finding nothing weird is
    better than them launching a full-on investigation. “And so that’s where
    we stand,” Miss Tōko mentions with a sigh. “Notice, Kokutō, how Alba said
    that his ward was flawless. And yet fate gives us not one, but two
    incidents that put the high rise on our suspicion radar, and now Shiki’s
    gone and disappeared there as well. If there’s a lesson here, it’s that
    reality will always abhor a paradox, no matter how well disguised.” “Is
    that what both of you called that ‘Deterrent’ a while earlier?” Upon the
    mention of the strange word, Miss Tōko adopts an almost disgusted look as
    she nods in agreement. “Perhaps. It’s only a theory, a metaphysical rule
    of the universe. It’s the ‘consensus’ I always talk about, humanity’s
    greatest ally, and a mage’s most constant enemy. We have no ill will
    towards people, and only want to live in peace. Unfortunately, reality
    feels the same way. The combined will of all the people form into a
    consensual paradigm which tends to restore reality to a stable state, to
    combat things that logically shouldn’t exist…like the Art and mages.
    Sometimes, when the consensus is so focused, it coalesces, and becomes a
    literal manifestation. It can cast its hands into fate to move otherwise
    normal people in positions that would topple great men. Humanity’s
    swirling consensus itself is its unseen protector, and the people it
    channels its will into were the ones we called heroes, though it’s not so
    easy to have the same result now in the plurality of our world and the
    ease with which we can fuck ourselves over without knowing it. The
    Deterrent influences people all the time, saving us without us knowing it.
    But don’t mistake it as having any empathy for humans. It’s only loyalty
    is to the consensus, and it doesn’t take into account something like human
    happiness, where there seems to be no consensus at all. We can only be
    sure about two things: it is humanity’s representative will, and it will
    eliminate the paradoxes of the world, the mages and their experiments with
    the illogical Art.” Respect and loathing permeates Miss Tōko’s speech at
    the same time, as though she can’t quite decide how to deal with this
    “Deterrent” business. Her story reminds me of many things, of many
    philosophers all speaking about something similar; and another story of a
    certain peasant woman of Orleans, driven to action by a force she said was
    God. Perhaps this Deterrent was what truly moved her? “Well, that
    certainly clarifies that, ma’am. So I suppose Shiki is a part of a similar
    experiment, right?” I know where she’s going with this, as I’ve learned
    long before that she says nothing that is without meaning, even if might
    only be revealed sometimes much later. So I gathered from her conversation
    with Alba that this experiment—or whatever it is—is the reason behind
    Shiki’s disappearance. She smothers her cigarette after one last drag then
    turns to look at me, smiling contentedly at something beyond what I can
    grasp. “I don’t know what Alba is planning with Shiki exactly. I just know
    that he plans to reach the spiral of origin. At some point, they’ll have
    to use her body, but Alba’s wasn’t one for that sort of disgusting work
    back then, and like everything about him, it probably hasn’t changed.
    He’ll think it through until the last minute. Assuming they captured Shiki
    safely, she’s probably still alive.” “She is,” I say firmly. “I mean,
    that’s the only thing he could’ve meant when he said he’d take care of
    her, right?” I realize I have my eyes set solidly on Miss Tōko, which she
    might have mistaken for an accusatory look. The truth is that I can’t get
    the little fear of Shiki being killed out of my head. “Which is why we
    need to move now.” But how, I ask myself. I could call the police on the
    guy, but from experience with Miss Tōko, I’m sure a mage must always have
    some sort of escape plan when they need it in short notice. And so it
    boils down to two things: eliminate Alba, or get in and sneak Shiki out of
    there. I suppose, if I’m honest with myself, I’d have to say it boils down
    to one. I move to search for the blueprints of the building among Miss
    Tōko’s scattered documents. Maybe I can find a way in that even he doesn’t
    know about. “Stop. Stop, stop, stop,” Miss Tōko says with audible
    frustration as she waves her arms to get my attention. “Is your head
    really so thick that everything I’ve said just passed through your skull?
    There is absolutely no way you’re getting in there. Just like when Shiki
    just woke up from the coma, this isn’t your cue to dance. After all, a
    mage should face a mage. It’s only proper.” Upon saying that, she stands
    up abruptly, and puts on her brown trench coat, leather make and thick
    enough to probably receive glancing blows from a knife. “You got one thing
    right, though. No use in drawing this out too long. I’ll set out tonight.
    Kokutō, if you’ll be so kind as to get the orange briefcase in my closet.”
    There is a hint of resignation in her voice, and driven by that, I head to
    her room and open the closet. Inside, the clothes you would expect to be
    present are instead replaced by bags and the desired orange briefcase, all
    of them looking like they’re quite full for a long trip. When I carry the
    briefcase by the hand, I discover just how heavy it is. Despite the
    copious amount of stickers stuck to it, it retains its well-made
    appearance. When I return and hand it over to her, she retrieves the
    cigarette box from her breast pocket and hands it to me. “Keep it for me.
    They’re cigarettes from Taiwan and they fucking suck, but there’s only one
    box of them, made by some weirdo. It’s probably my second favorite thing
    in the world.” She turns her back on me to leave. “Is your most favorite
    thing yourself?” I ask. “Good guess,” she says, laughing, “but even I
    wouldn’t place a person in the level of objects.” Before she’s out of the
    door, she speaks her piece one more time. “Kokutō, mages are kind to their
    friends. They’re the only thing they have in a world against them. So do
    me a favor: stay out of trouble, and just stay here, alright? I’ll bring
    Shiki back tonight.” And with that, the brown-coated mage opens the door
    and departs, with me not even saying a goodbye even as I hear the rare
    sound of her shoes echoing upon the staircase. <br>
  <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
  To the west, an orange sunset blazed, bathing the spiral high rise in its
  rays and creating a long shadow pointing to the east. Aozaki Tōko stands
  just outside of the apartment building’s garden as all the city contents
  itself with the approach of twilight. Her immense brown trench coat doesn’t
  suit her small frame at all, worn more like armor than an article of clothing.
  She gives the high rise’s top floor one short glance before taking her orange
  briefcase in one hand and striding through the greenery of the garden and
  entering the building itself. The glass walls of the entrance let in a trace of the sunset, dyeing the walls and floor
  just beside it in a color as red as the sun it emanates from. After sparing a moment for a final sigh, she walks
  forward, then upon reaching the central elevator, turns abruptly toward the right, heading to the east lobby.
  She remembers it from the last time she was here, its semi-circular shape and stairs to a second floor reminding her
  how large the room is. Here, the violent redness of outside can no longer be found, replaced instead with yellow
  lights shining on the marble floor and the cheaply painted walls.
  “What a surprise! You are quite easy to incite after all, Aozaki.” The statement echoes in the lobby, said by a man in
  a high toned voice. Saying nothing, Tōko instead directs her attention to the gently sloping stairs at the center of
  it all, where the man in a red coat stands in one of the steps. “But it is, of course, a surprise of the welcome
  variety. I welcome you, master puppeteer, to my gehenna.”
  Cornelius Alba’s smile displays his teeth, and with a similarly grandiose gesture, bows from his waist.
  “Gehenna?” Tōko asks with eyebrow cocked.
  “Appropriate, isn’t it? This is a place much like that ancient valley where Baalites once threw their children into
  the roasting fires, though unfortunately the god Moloch is not here with us now. It’s a reality so splendidly
  demarcated from the consensus of the masses, and here we carve our path to ascension.”
  He has his eyes cast downward at Tōko as he speaks in triumph. But she doesn’t give the man any room to read her when
  she replies.
  “Hardly a surprise that the descendant of Cornelius Agrippa is a probable Judaizer. Unlike you though, I imagine
  Agrippa would have divined the true purpose to this place. And if you want to see the slaughter and wailing and
  gnashing of teeth that you love so much, I suggest you make a quick stop in Kosovo or the Congo. Your pitiful
  operation is nothing compared to that.” Tōko sets her briefcase down on the floor, producing a dry clicking sound.
  “This place is nothing but a purgatory where none of the souls pass on, where endless suffering is the end goal and
  not the punishment. This isn’t divine, nor is it magic, at least not coming from someone like you.”
  The red coated mage’s face betrays only a small twitch of muscle at her words. Tōko looks at Alba, but also beyond
  him, as if her opponent was not the man but the very building itself.
  “Now,” Tōko continues, “let’s drop the pretense that it’s you who came up with this Taijitu idea and just make Alaya
  show his face already. You have little business with what will soon occur. I don’t know your real reason for being
  here, but it’s likely it has little to do with any higher arcane goals. Just giving you a fair warning in return for
  the one you gave me.”
  Tōko casts her eyes around the walls, searching for an unseen enemy, while never returning her glance to Alba. The red
  coated mage looks upon her with murder and what may be the prelude to tears in his eyes.
  “You were always like this,” he murmurs. “Yes, you’re always like this!” Louder now. “You always looked down on me. I
  studied runes before you did, studied the Art of dolls and puppeteering well in advance of you. But oh, how you fooled
  those imbeciles in the Collegium into thinking you were better, that you were more creative. But we both know the
  truth. I’m the inheritor of Sponheim Abbey, after all! After my forty years of scholarship in the Art, a mage no older
  than a teenager has no business even being recognized by me!”
  Somewhere in his tirade, the murmur turned into an agitated bellowing that echoes in the lobby. Tōko stares
  uninterestedly at this man who has abandoned his niceties so neatly only to insult her thoroughly.
  “Age isn’t a factor in academics, you know,” Tōko replies. “And Cornelius, don’t get me wrong, I think taking time to
  look younger is alright, but you’re so focused on it that your Art loses its touch, I think.” She delivers it calmly,
  and yet this is perhaps the worst precision guided insult she can ever throw at him. The face that once looked like it
  belonged to a young man now twists with hatred, returning him to his appropriate age.
  “I haven’t said why I came here in the first place, have I?” With a deep breath, Alba regains composure. “I have no
  interest in Alaya’s little experiment, nor do I share his goal in reaching the Akasha, that numinous concept that may
  or may not exist. I see no reason why one needs to swim upstream to attain gnosis and ascension.” He withdraws one
  step upward. “Telling you about Shiki Ryōgi was my idea. The old man Alaya put himself in harm’s way to capture the
  little girl. Offed themselves about the same time, I suppose. And so, this domain is mine until the structure twists
  time and returns him to his previous state, but I have no intention of continuing Alaya’s work. I don’t suppose you’ve
  figured it out, but I came here to your little edge of the world, just so I could kill you, Aozaki!”
  Alba hisses her name, like a curse that could destroy his very ability to speak. He runs to the top of the stairs to
  the second floor balcony, and Tōko only looks on curiously. From the walls flow a curious substance that appears to be
  liquid, sharing its cream color with the walls it clings to.
  “Playing your tulpas, huh?” Tōko utters in a mix of bemusement and scorn. With astonishing quickness, the substance
  oozes down from the walls and into the first floor where Tōko is standing dead center. As it nears the floor, it
  starts to coalesce in different places, in different forms: some humanoid, some beast like, all quite real. Their
  surface resembles keloid, and their mass constantly shifts, a face here and there, or some barely recognizable animal,
  appearing as though they are in a constant state of perfect, if unsightly, decay.
  “Not the best tulpas I’ve seen Alba, but not entirely surprising. Hey, maybe you can be a special effects guy! I mean,
  of course you’d be limited to creature features and Hammer horrors, but it’s better than sitting around in an old
  abbey, right?” She shouts at Alba even as the things inch ever closer to her.
  Well, maybe this is a horror movie of some sort, Tōko thinks. Not the kind where the problem is solved with a cross or
  a shotgun, though. With barely two meters left separating her from the slowly advancing “tulpas”, she stands stoic,
  reaching instinctively for the absent pack of cigarettes in her breast pocket. Fuck, that’s right, Mikiya’s got them.
  Should’ve bought some Japanese brands on my way here. Well, we all have to make sacrifices once in a while, even for
  something as boring as this display of Art.
  “On second thought, Alba, maybe Hollywood isn’t your calling after all,” Tōko yells out loud. “There’s a much more
  discerning audience now. Creature design workshop time! Let’s see if we can’t teach you a thing or two!”
  With an unexpected motion, she kicks the briefcase she had set down on the floor next to her earlier.
  “OUT!” With one word, her voice booms, containing an authority that brooks no refusal. At the mere mention of the
  word, the bag opens, revealing itself to be empty. And yet, something black forms a tight perimeter around Tōko
  Aozaki. Like a dark whirlwind given form, and Tōko right in the calm eye of the storm, the black object spins round
  and round, wider and wider, its speed blinding both her and Alba to its true form. In the space of a few seconds, the
  tulpas are completely gone, with nary a trace of the ooze.
  Still standing at the center of it all, having barely moved from her original position, is Tōko Aozaki. Beside her lie
  the open, empty briefcase…and a cat, peacefully relaxing. Alba can only stare at it in a daze. The cat stands taller
  than Tōko, even as it sits, and its body is pitch black, without a trace of warmth on its surface. A cat made from
  shadow, whose only distinguishing feature is the pair of eyes it possesses, resembling a hieroglyph.
  “What in the hell is that thing?” Alba says, incredulously glaring at the cat. Their eyes meet. And though both he and
  Tōko know there is no other distinguishable feature on its “face,” he feels the creature smile at him. Alba looks for
  all the world like he’s just seen a nightmare, but Tōko keeps her silence. Somewhere, a steady metronomic scratching
  fills a tempo to the dead air. “So the rumors I heard were wrong? Your sister mage didn’t destroy your familiar?” he
  asks in disbelief, unable to withstand the growing silence.
  “Let’s not start throwing around libelous accusations at your sources now, whoever they may be.” Then she directs her
  attention to the silhouette of the cat beside her, raising a hand to pat it gently, and saying in cloying words, “Good
  girl. Human meat is the next item for dinner, which should be much better than the pile of tulpas fashioned from prima
  materia that you just swallowed. This one is more nutritious. Don’t restrain yourself. After all, he’s one of my
  friends from the old days. Remember all those times I told you how tasty they are?”
  In an instant, the black silhouette is off, seemingly gliding above the marble floor to the foot of the stairs,
  manifesting the same haste that it had done only a moment before, taking no more than ten seconds to reach the first
  step. Its feet do not appear to be moving, or at least mortal vision presents it as such. But Alba, like Tōko, sees
  like no mortal, and a mage cannot be brought low so simply. Before the shadow cat had even begun to move, Alba had
  already begun to weave a spell.
  “False shadow, who can neither touch nor see, let the light of my Art cast you into oblivion!”
  With a calmness belying his current predicament, Alba recites the words, the incantations called lorica which many
  mages use to decorate the weaving of their Art. The lorica and the expression is a mage’s own, colored by his choice
  and personality, a way to channel the Art through a mnemonic familiar to the paradigm of their mind. The goal is a
  sort of autohypnosis; coercing themselves into a state of mind that enhances a spell’s potency so they can better
  manipulate the rules of the material world. Impressive, Tōko thinks. He actually cut down on the excessive five-line
  loricas from way back. Didn’t even take two seconds. Guess he can improve. Yet Tōko only expresses her praise through
  a snort in his direction.
  “Let my will be my fist and strike you down.”
  He gestures, arm outstretched, in the direction of the shadow closing with him, just arriving at the foot of the
  stairs. When it reaches the first step, the very air rumbles, and the lobby instantly becomes noticeably hotter.
  Willed into existence right before his eyes, Alba conjures a pillar of blue flame, undulating like a mirage of a
  geyser and consuming the stairway. Stretching from the floor and to the ceiling it soon bursts through, it starts to
  rob the room of its oxygen, and the shadow that would have climbed the stairs to assault Alba can no longer be seen.
  No animal can survive that heat; the temperature is high enough to reduce any common solid object to nothingness.
  In moments, the pillar of flame dies, but what Alba sees in its wake makes his blue eyes widen.
  “Impossible,” he mentions, for in the middle of the charred stairway is the black familiar, licking itself as though
  the spell had produced a good sensation. It locks eyes with him for a moment, and then resumes it charge toward Alba.
  He spares no hesitation.
  “Again!”
  Alba repeats the spell, noticeably weaker this time without the benefit of the lorica. The blue pillar appears again,
  but the familiar is no longer held at bay. Alba can almost see the flames pass over it and through it as the creature
  races toward him in a straight, unwavering course.
  “Again!”
  Flames appear and disappear yet another time. The cat familiar nears its prey.
  “Again!”
  The fourth time is as ineffective as the first. With the cat safely on the second floor, it approaches Alba and it
  opens itself, its entire larger-than-man sum breaking open from head to toe like a tulip, losing any semblance of a
  cat. With what could be termed its insides, Alba can see the tulpas he had vested so much hope in earlier clinging to
  the walls of the cavity, and he finally realizes that this familiar is nothing more than a mouth, an object that
  consumes that has simply taken the shape of a cat.
  “Aga—”
  Facing death, Alba risks one last attempt to weave a spell, but before he finishes, the thing takes him in its mouth,
  the cavity grasping him by the red coat hanging on his shoulders. The blackness of the shadow is the last thing he can
  remember before he sinks into oblivion.
  “Ōken.”
  A third voice is heard, and a lorica echoes throughout the lobby.
  At the word’s utterance, the shadow familiar that has Alba by the scruff of the neck immediately halts. Even Tōko
  knows enough about the owner of the voice to face it the moment she heard it. Behind Alba stands a man, burdened with
  eyes of perpetual melancholy and rigidity and wearing a black greatcoat. He stands stock still as though he was
  observing the entire time, and yet one cannot find any traces of his sudden appearance. The man retrieves Alba with
  one arm, and then unceremoniously casts him away, setting him down on the ground. The cat familiar, having stepped
  onto the curious tri-circular geometry describing a perimeter around the man, is still as a stone. When the man
  finally notices Tōko, she feels the air become noticeably colder, losing the slack it held seconds ago, though she’d
  like to think that it’s just her imagination. The structure itself seems to tense to welcome its true master.
  “Aozaki. You have changed much. Has it been so long?”
  “It has. I wish it could’ve been longer.”
  The man known as Sōren Alaya descends the blackened steps, ash still falling from the ceiling drifting down to rest on
  his shoulders, and Tōko’s familiar seemingly being strung along by the spell that surrounds him. He remains on the
  first step of the stairs, forcing Tōko to angle her head slightly upward to face him.
  “Alba has overstepped his bounds. I had intended for this experiment to pass without your notice. This encounter is a
  curious coincidence, but perhaps inevitable.”
  “Ah, coincidence,” Tōko sighs, “the convenient word we use to blind ourselves from the sacred mystery play of fate.”
  She slowly retreats back to the wall as she speaks to buy time. Sōren is different from Alba. Though their facility
  with the Art may rate similarly, Sōren Alaya has home court advantage here in his sanctum. She keeps her attention
  directed forward even as she falls back, watching for any openings she can exploit even as she knows Alaya is doing
  the same.
  “So tell me, what’s up with your Schrödinger’s mansion?” she muses. “You do already know that killing a whole bunch of
  people to build up a resonance of death to reach the origin has been proven impossible quite spectacularly before,
  right?”
  “I know the history. But I also know a truth you are not privy to. I too was blinded by the success that sheer numbers
  seemed to promise. Given enough men, I would come upon a soul I could latch onto in its passing of the threshold, and
  follow its return to the spiral of origin. But I was denied, for I looked to the number, not the manner of death. And
  so I studied the deaths, and as the hexagrams of the I Ching prescribe, I was able to discern the sixty-four manners
  of death, of which each resident of this domain corresponds to. What I have here is a microcosm of the universe. I
  witness their anguish, and record its significance, and in time, perhaps reality and my will may transmute the
  sixty-four hexagrams into the eight, and that into the four shishō, and that into the pair of extremes that is the
  ryōgi, and finally into the Akasha, the great origin.”
  “Man, Alaya, this whole business of fashioning things into the whole is consuming you bad. You indulge your occult
  Arts, missing the true point of the ryōgi polarity: that opposites aren’t that way because of conflict, but because of
  dynamism. Opposites define each other, which is why they aren’t a whole. You place such a premium on the totality of
  death, give such importance to its chronicling that you’re forgetting the life that gave them their worth. Look at
  yourself! This St. Peter with the book of life thing you got going will only destroy you.”
  “It does not matter whether I die or not. Only reaching the origin for my purposes drives me now.” His words are
  confident, unwavering. He truly believes in his self-appointed duty.
  This building, with its self-contained spiral of death and rebirth, has existed for so long outside of consensus, it
  has become its own separate reality. This place is his temple, an extension of him, and his tie to it is so strong it
  bows to his will, Tōko thinks. The entire place reeks with the resonance of the hatred the people here can no longer
  give voice to. It’s sickening, and Alaya is making it stronger every day, with deaths that never get the opportunity
  to pass the threshold every time.
  Deaths of silence borne from lovers and family, of father, mother, and the quiet march of time.
  Deaths of malice borne from lovers and family, of friends, colleagues, and the conflicting hatred of strangers.
  Alba was right about one thing: all of this—the confluence of all this corrupted energy, all the mana the structure is
  heaving forth from the land, all the death—is one big sacrificial altar, framed in fearful symmetry, all for Alaya’s
  crazy dream. And Tōko finally realizes that this is something far beyond the realm of simple tricks that the Art can
  offer, but well into the domain of rumored sorcery, the pure magic, the product of true gnosis beyond the reach of
  mortal hands, and for the first time, she doubts herself.
  “How can this thing stand without the consensus of humanity tearing it apart? Something should have happened by now.
  At this point the Deterrent should already have made its play, moving an individual as its agent, triggering events
  that will cause your downfall one way or another. Why is there no one?” Tōko asks with doubt and curiosity.
  “Have you not asked yourself why you yourself are in this city? Why a man would find himself burgling that particular
  house? Why a woman would, in her dying moments, stumble clumsily inside this building? I have kept this experiment as
  covert as possible, and yet here we have signs of the Deterrent working against me. I once tried to find a way to fool
  it, but it is all, as I realized, temporary. I simply did not have the ability.” For the first time, there is
  something akin to disappointment in his tone. He keeps his intensity focused on Tōko, and sees nothing but her. “Any
  man thinks himself less once he realizes he is no less potent than any animal. Men strive for perfection, but are
  denied so by the consensus, a paradox that forms the theme of our lives: existing to climb ever higher heights, but
  rejecting the task only to exist.
  “The mages who have ascended—the ones who have reached the origin—had no will to power, but instead were given that
  power by the deterministic properties that entropy imposes on our reality. When one speaks of ability, one truly
  speaks only of fate, of the prefabricated decisions, capabilities, and choices that shape our lives. We humans who
  have inherited the potential to ascend have fallen so far into this material world, our nature scattered and
  pluralized, separated from the power that is our birthright. And so I realized that while I may not have the ability
  to thwart the Deterrent and realize the path to the spiral of origin, I only need find someone in the multitudes that
  can. I needed only one empty soul, whose nature tied it back to the indescribable ‘ ’. It has taken me many years—”
  “But you found her. And her name is Shiki Ryōgi.” Tōko wonders briefly if the Ryōgi dynasty even knew what the
  dangerous progeny of their lineage implied and was truly capable of becoming. “Then you used Kirie Fujō and Asagami
  Fujino as bait to lure Shiki in without attracting the Deterrent to your scent. You hold two broken mirrors up to her
  to make her realize what she is. Got a hand it to you, there’s no better teacher than experience. Your gameplan for
  Shiki still isn’t clear, though. What’s it going to be? Bringing Shiki back from the dead? Or did you just kidnap her
  for a social call?”
  “What I did two years ago only set the destiny that had been forged for Ryōgi into motion. A solution has presented
  itself. She has no need of that body, and I will take it for my own purposes.”
  “Wait a minute. Don’t tell me you want to transfer your soul…” Tōko’s voice trails off, her index finger connecting
  invisible dots in the air until it ffinally makes sense to her. Alaya sees no need to answer, believing it to be
  obvious. Finally, Tōko says, “You’re sick, you know that? But since you’re still here, I suppose Shiki’s still
  alright. I don’t think it’s in bad form to ask if you’ll just give her back to me?”
  “If that is your desire, then come and claim her.”
  “So a duel, I expect. And I don’t fancy myself the violent type either. These are the punches I need to roll with when
  I decided to take her in, I suppose.”
  “I do not think it is in bad form to ask if you will not work with me in this endeavor?” Alaya pleads, though his
  hostile demeanor does not budge an inch. Tōko answers her with a sly smile, lowering her head politely and closing her
  amber eyes as if she had just made a regrettable but necessary decision. “I see,” Alaya continues. “I thought that
  would be your answer. It is a shame that it has to be so. There was a time when we were both driven to seek the
  origin. I truly miss that part of you.” Alaya moves a step forward, accompanied by its echoing tap on the marble floor
  as he finally descends to the first floor. “You were different from the other mages in the Collegium. Ambitious.
  Perhaps even as obsessed as any able philosopher would be. Yours was the path of the material, while mine was the path
  of the soul. I had even thought, that in our lives spent chasing after our goal, you would be first. But you abandoned
  your calling. You do not even carry yourself as a mage would anymore. It mystifies me. For what else do we mages study
  and seize power if not for ascension? Why concern yourself with this pointless self-exile in this country?” Only his
  eyes communicate his anger and frustration, but with everything else about him, he remains still.
  Tōko shrugs and smiles. “There’s nothing really special about it. I just got tired of the whole cosmic game, filled to
  the brim with paradoxes as it was. The more you learn, it just seems you realize that you’ve just grown dumber. Like
  you know how they say the clearest path to ascension is an empty mind, but if that was the case, you wouldn’t even be
  aware of the spiral of origin in the first place? Yeah, shit like that. I accepted it and moved on. You haven’t. Seems
  to be the biggest difference, though.” She sighs through the last sentence, and the confession seems all the more
  melancholic for it. Now they stand and look upon each other on equal footing.
  “Then you have fallen into a lie,” Alaya says, his voice falling into a tone of all the regret he can muster. “It does
  not, however, answer why you are here.”
  “You’ve gone too far to even realize it now. And I’m telling you, it’s not entirely about Shiki either. Girl’s
  practically a mystery that even I can’t unravel. Dollars to donuts she finds her own way out of here.” Tōko briefly
  entertains the idea of being someone unknowingly influenced by the Deterrent, but she quickly dispels it. I’m no hero,
  she thinks, not that it matters. The only thing she accepts is her own life, built from the coincidences and crossed
  paths that may never happen again, even if she lived somewhere as iterative as this structural embodiment of paradox.
  Her resolve is borne only out of an inclination to protect it.
  “Alaya, you must think me weak. And maybe you would be right. I’ve come to hold the concept of the solitary sage as an
  ideal, an individual with power tempered by wisdom, isolated and alone. But I know I’ll never really achieve it, with
  all the sins and baggage in my closet. Mages build their chantries to close themselves off, thinking themselves above
  the rabble, and yet retain their grip on their previous humanity in tiny, but noticeable ways. They toil with their
  ars magna, a Great Work, the final key to their labors, but for what? An abstract dream of ascension? For a fake sense
  of a greater good? Then where are these ‘enlightened’ despots, guiding our journey in the material world? Is it you?
  You think you’re pure while the mortals are unclean. Bullshit. You shut your eyes to the blood on your hands that
  brands you a criminal and a disgrace, all the while calling yourself ‘special’ and the true savior of this slowly
  ebbing reality. I once thought like you, but then I wised up down the line. Face it, Alaya. Mages entertain their
  obsessions of ascension and pneumatological delusions because we’re the ones that are weak.”
  The black clad mage sees fit not to speak, the best thing that passes as contemplation for him. He only continues to
  move forward one step at a time toward Tōko, until he says, “Even if you are right, there is no turning back on the
  path that leads me closer every moment to the origin. Your actions and opposition force me to acknowledge you as the
  Deterrent’s will manifest. In the end, Aozaki, the lie has tempered your ambition. It is disappointing that you were
  still human, in the end.”
  Tōko notes that reality inside the building shifts perceptibly along the concepts of Alaya’s mind. From afar, mage and
  mage end the long discourse that fill the hole of the long years of each other’s absence with a two final statements,
  recited almost like a prayer, a chant with the weight of tradition to it.
  “What do you seek, Alaya?”
  “True wisdom.”
  “Where do you seek it, Alaya?”
  “Nowhere else but within me.”
  His footsteps halt near the center of the lobby. Together, they begin their opening gambits in a match that seeks to
  expunge the other from the world altogether.
  Tōko places a foot atop her fallen briefcase, carefully studying how Alaya will conduct his attack. Behind him, her
  black cat familiar is in complete stasis, unable to defeat the magic of Alaya’s ward. Tōko remembers it, and the
  component thaumaturgical processes by which it is formed, all of which Alaya named after phrases and traditional
  mantras: fugu, kongō, dakatsu, taiten, chōgyō, and ōken. Together they form a potent ward that envelops the space
  around him, halting the movements of any who step within that cannot overcome its magic. Normally, such a ward cannot
  be moved, establishing a simple boundary, but somehow he has found a way to violate this rule, and thus became a
  formidable enemy, stymieing any efforts to fight him in close combat, not to mention the other Arts with which he
  handles projectiles.
  Unlike Alba, both Tōko and Alaya never incorporated their Art of manipulating and shaping matter to compel it to an
  offensive purpose. And yet, even within Tōko’s favored rune Art, there are ways. Tōko need only write “sōwilō”, the
  rune for fire, and she can shape it into reality. Normally, she can write it from afar, in the air if she wanted, but
  any mage can spot the casting and stop it. For it to work, she needs to get up close and write it directly on his
  body, but Alaya’s wards are denying her that option.
  Tōko curses her inflexibility in the Art in this pivotal moment, but as far she knows Alaya is in a similar position,
  unless he has learned a thing or two in the years they’ve been apart. She had chosen crafting dolls as her metaphor
  for ascension, while he had chosen the study of death. Besides this, Tōko is aware of the skill Alaya can bring to
  bear even without the Art, as even he has seen his fair share of wars. Knowing this, Tōko has no other option except
  to play it defensively and attempt to lure him to the trap she had set here some time before.
  Alaya makes his move. He extends his left arm toward Tōko, palm out, like a man calling out to someone on a distant
  horizon, and his hand makes only the slightest twitch.
  “SHUKU,” he recites. He clenches his palm into a fist in time with the lorica with a crushing weight. Simultaneously,
  Tōko is struck back with a sudden force, the enchanted coat she had relied on to protect her from attack being torn in
  a visibly radial pattern around her center of mass. The attack makes her fall to one knee on the ground. It only takes
  Tōko a moment to know what Alaya did: he manipulated the space she occupied,
  distorting distances and creating a tear that crushed the very air she stood upon. She is surprised; even space is
  within his mastery now. The building and the influence his will has upon the area must certainly be helping him cast
  such an Art with ease.
  “Damn it,” Tōko coughs out, a few precious droplets of blood escaping her lips. She forces down the rest of the bloody
  lump rising in her throat. “How many bones did I pay for that one?” Right now, she envies the physical endurance that
  Shiki has demonstrated time and again. She has no time to know how extensive the damage to her body is, but she does
  know that her coat took the brunt of it, but that’s all. One more of that, and it’s all over.
  “GO!” She orders, her own lorica tinged with magic. The shadow familiar stirs, reacting to it. It seems it could move
  through Alaya’s wards after all, revealing its state of rest as an elaborate act. Tōko can almost feel what can be
  described as an emotion of relief emanate from it when she unleashes the order to attack.
  “What—” Alaya let’s slip a moment of surprise as he turns his head over his shoulder to react. With barely a hair’s
  breadth of distance between him and the familiar, Alaya manages to perform the same trick twice, crushing the space
  directly in front of the hand he raises to meet the approaching attacker. Before the shadow familiar falls into the
  affected space however, it evades and changes its direction midflight, directing itself to the ceiling where it lands
  its cat paws and hangs upside down in defiance of common gravity.
  “Enough of this,” declares Alaya with rising confidence. He raises his other hand and directs it at the ceiling even
  before the familiar finds purchase upon it, predicting its course. By the time the shadow lands, Alaya has already
  woven his Art. The spell crushes that portion of the ceiling, and the cat along with it. He watches as the shadow
  seemingly folds into itself in mere moments until it can no longer be seen, presumably crushed. The spell leaves only
  a small gap in the ceiling where the cat once was.
  “Your rook is disposed of and the king checked. Was it not you who said that a mage that relies overmuch on his pieces
  loses the battle when the pieces are destroyed?” Alaya mocks. He returns his attention to Tōko, arm still extended and
  palm open. Tōko returns to him a look of dissatisfaction.
  “I’m touched that you remember that. I’ve walked right into your little magic trap of a building just to reminisce
  about old times right to the end. How could you have ever lost to that little twerp Shiki with something as potent as
  this place?”
  “Had I been less careful, I would not have captured her alive, which was my objective. But for you, no such safeguards
  need hinder me.”
  “I didn’t know you had it in you to go to such lengths for the body of a girl, Alaya.” She leans an arm heavily on the
  wall beside her. “I swear, you and Alba have no cinematic sense for suspense. Let me tell you how to do it. Firstly,
  the monster shouldn’t talk. Second, don’t explain what it is. Third, it can’t die.”
  The last sentence brings a moment of realization to Alaya’s face before he looks back over his shoulder. Sure enough,
  hanging over the hole in the ceiling is the cat familiar, with no visible injuries to its credit.
  “Shuku!” Alaya lashes his arm out to aim his spell at the familiar as fast as he can, but it is no use. The familiar
  neatly skirts the spell as it jumps out of the way and toward the black-clad mage. Flying like a loosed arrow, the
  familiar opens its body up in the same shape of the mouth it had donned when consuming Alba, and a moment later, Alaya
  is caught in the cavity. Only a faint intake of breath, an indication of surprise perhaps, escapes Alaya’s lips before
  he is devoured and snapped cleanly in two by the creature’s jaw. Only Alaya’s shoulder and head remain, tossed aside
  violently by the thrice grown shadow and hitting the staircase, rolling downwards with low, dull thuds. Tōko observes
  the expression of dim horror that color his face in his final moments before speaking to herself.
  “Mages really should read some Clausewitz along with their hermetic texts. That’s how you do a surprise attack,
  Alaya.” She pushes herself off the wall and starts to walk closer to her dispatched foe.
  Until she hears a cruel, crunching noise. She ascribes it at first to some far off location, at least until deep
  crimson blood is expelled from her lips, coughed and vomited out. With vision growing steadily hazier, she casts her
  eyes downward, only to find an arm, conspicuously sticking out of her own body. Tōko Aozaki doesn’t know what to make
  heads or tails of it at first, but she soon comes to the realization that the arm wrapped thick with blood is a man’s
  arm, and that the object its accompanying hand grasped is a heart.
  Her heart.
  And it is then that she finally realizes. From behind her, a voice whispers into her ear.
  “You are correct. Insight can be found in the most unlikely places.” The voice is burdened with great grief, regret,
  and hatred; Sōren Alaya’s voice, without a doubt.
  With blood escaping her mouth in narrow rivulets, Tōko asks, “That…was a puppet, wasn’t it? A decoy—”
  “Yes.” Alaya holds her close, his eyes taking in the sight of her heart.
  “But you are quite real. The fury in this heart is unmistakable. It is almost too beautiful to destroy.” And yet, with
  an ease that makes the organ seem to have the consistency of nothing harder than a water bag full to bursting, he
  crushes the heart with his hand, and watches the blood seep through his fingers. “I divined the trick to your
  familiar. It did not come from the briefcase, did it? It was a mere projection.”
  The briefcase then collapses, the Art used to cloak its nature now gone. In its place lies a projector, still making
  noises as it settles clankily on the floor.
  “Ingenious,” he remarks. “An artifact of the prima materia, projecting a tangible creature. It is no wonder now why my
  Art was ineffective. It was foolish of me not to have seen it earlier.”
  Tōko doesn’t waste her last breaths answering him. Only questions come to her lips; questions for her former friend
  and murderer.
  “I didn’t…get to finish earlier. The last question: What is it you desire, Alaya?”
  “I do not desire.”
  They utter the same questions and confront the same answers that had haunted them for years, and the familiarity
  somehow gives Tōko the last force of will to chuckle, each expelling of breath accompanied by blood blossoming in the
  air.
  I do not desire. Tōko remembers the words. It didn’t seem too long ago now when she was a Collegium whelp, and Alaya
  not much more than that. When a master asked the assembled neophytes the same question, they mentioned outlandish and
  fantastical dreams of glory and discovery. But Alaya expressed himself differently. I do not desire. Though the
  neophytes took it as a sign of a lack of avarice in him and laughed, Tōko found nothing to take lightly in that reply.
  Only a vague feeling of dread. He was right in the sense that he did not desire. He took ascension as a mission,
  beyond the petty godly ambitions of other mages, and into something more personal that he hid well within him: a deep
  and abiding hatred for the paradox of humanity.
  “Alaya…there’s one last piece of advice you need to know.”
  “I will listen. Hurry, you have precious few seconds left.”
  “You don’t know what you’re trying to kill with this experiment.” The only strength Tōko has left she directs to her
  speech, and her mouth moves in quivering movements that slur her speech somewhat. “Gunning for the Akashic Record
  means you’re going to have to take down the Deterrent, the combined consensus of humanity’s will, and the world’s
  tendency for homeostasis.”
  “And what of it?”
  Tōko’s choking and coughing fills the air, but she says her next statement as clearly as she can. “Think real hard
  about which of the two forces you’re really fighting.”
  “A joke, surely. I have long since accepted my conflict with humanity’s unified unconscious will.
  “That’s the tune of about six billion people. Do you think you control all of them, right up to their death? Do you
  think your conviction will make you win?”
  “I do,” he replies abruptly, without hesitation or exaggeration. The worst part, Tōko thinks, is that Alaya may
  actually be able do it. The confidence of his declaration, despite the knowledge of his difficult undertaking, says as
  much. The last hope she can have is a faint one, but she places her faith in it nonetheless: the sheer force of
  paradox that may shatter his path to hubris in a manner even he could not have accounted for.
  “I pity you, Alaya.”
  “Why?” He asks, but before he is able to receive an answer, Tōko’s life finally expires before him, leaving the body a
  worthless husk. Alaya thinks it a shame to allow her brain to rot away as the rest of her body. Better to preserve it,
  perhaps. And then study it. He withdraws the arm that pierced through Tōko’s flesh and places it atop the head, the
  other hand firmly grasping the dead face. With a simple twist, and the sound of crunching bone, he severs the head,
  leaving the body to fall lazily down against the floor.
  Holding the head on one hand, he retreats to the wall Tōko previously leaned on, the same wall from whence he came.
  Despite Tōko’s best efforts, she never fully understood this building and its genius design. It is beyond an extension
  of Alaya’s will, it is him; his paradigm made flesh from floor to ceiling and every speck of space. Entering the wall
  like water meeting water, he disappears.
    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    I recall the day I came across the scene of carnage.
I walked upon the earth of that scarred and solitary place, and my feet tread not on pebbles but on the fragments of bones. The wind carried on it the inescapable stench of death, seemingly threatening to cover the world entire.
It was a time of great upheaval and conflict, when men yet took to arms in the press of swords and pike, and when they knew the face of death by looking into an opponent’s eyes. War followed everywhere one went, and everywhere it left a trail of men, cruelly discarded. And ever the proof of the freedom of the strong harrying the weak was visible to all who still had eyes to see.
It was no longer a question of who killed whom, or if the battle was just; only a problem of who died, and whether someone bore witness to final breath. Where I heard battle was joined, I followed. Where insurrection brewed, my feet carried me. Sometimes, I arrived when the battle was yet fresh, sometimes when the struggle was long concluded. But always, the same result: the reaper’s work in droves.
It comes for us all no matter how much a father lends a shout of surrender to heaven, or how much a mother cries for her son, or how much that son dies smiling even as it expires from hunger. It steals into our private rooms, when candles are snuffed and the shadows grow larger, rendering the struggle of virtuous men meaningless.
And though I knew all of this, my travels continued. Yet all I saw bid my memory to ever return to that scene of carnage. They couldn’t be saved. Men cannot be saved, though their prayers to supernal beings would say otherwise. For man is a creature not meant to be saved but to end, hiding the dread of the past with the despair of the now. And in realizing this, I awakened to my own uselessness.
I cannot save any man, for I too am a man. But if that is what is fated, then perhaps I may be admitted, at least, to record death, to craft a morbid history of observance that suggests the cycle of souls. I would make a proof of lives ended and suffered.
And so my chronicle of death began.
The man wakes to a drop of water, then the sound of hissing steam. Sōren Alaya stands up silently, feeling dazed as if waking from a dream.
“I did not know I still saw dreams. A remnant from the past, dear though it is,” the mage confides to himself. But he is not alone. Around him, in a fashion, are the “residents” of the apartment building, and closer beside him is a jar shaped glass container, sealed and held near like a prize. It is filled with a liquid, and floating peacefully within is a single head, eyes shut in the manner of sleep. Tōko Aozaki’s head.
The sound of rising vapor pierces the silence yet again. The only light in the room emanates from the flat iron surface placed in the center of the room, its red hot glow warding the shadows away in its vicinity.
The mage has nothing to do now but wait. Both Shiki Ryōgi and Tōko Aozaki have been taken care of, their bodies destroyed or—in the case of Shiki—rendered immovable until such time that it serves its purpose. No one is left in any capable position to threaten him. So he waits.
“Alaya!” Announcing his presence, the red coated mage calls out to him as he enters the room unbidden. “Why do you delay here? You can’t slacken when there are things yet left to attend to.”
“It is finished, Cornelius. There is no need to ransack Aozaki’s sanctum. And though I have released Tomoe Enjō, he will not pose trouble to us. Learn to recognize these things and accept them.”
“Granted on both counts. But the question of Shiki Ryōgi still remains. You’ve only rendered her unconscious, correct? If she wakes up, she will obviously try to escape. We don’t have time to deal for such an eventuality when it happens, so maybe it would be wise to watch over her?”
“Baseless fear and nothing more. She is not simply confined to a room, free to wander. I have contained her in the space between spaces, a pocket realm within the structure. That is what the Art I wove her is designed to perform, after all. That besides, her body is weak, and even if she regained her consciousness, she can expend only little effort to escape. She will not run.”
Cornelius looks on Alaya’s consistently troubled face with a look of dissatisfaction. “Fine. I will take your word for it. I don’t even care about the Ryōgi girl anyway. I took your offer for different reasons, if you will remember.” His glance wanders to the glass canister placed on the table beside Alaya. “This isn’t what you promised, Alaya. You said I would be the one to kill Aozaki, or was that a lie?”
“You missed your chance and you have paid for it. I had no choice but to strike her down.”
“Strike her down? Don’t make me laugh. I know better than you the nature of those canisters. That thing yet lives. Perhaps a soft spot still exists beneath that hardened exterior of yours, eh?”
Cornelius’ question only elicits a low hum from Alaya which he cannot determine as a sign of assent or disagreement. Both of them know, however, that Tōko Aozaki is, in a sense, still alive. Her brain, at any rate. It is only unable to speak or to think. If that can be called a state of living, then it is them who recognize it as such.
“Looks like I’m not the only one that missed his chance,” he insinuates. “Remember the Collegium, Alaya. She was the Wild Red, or so people called her in fear in the past. Always the fox, ever cunning. If anyone would have plans designed to be set in motion even beyond the grave, it would be her. We should kill her.”
“What a fool you are to even utter that title of disrespect against her, Cornelius.”
“Wh…what?” The red coated mage’s words falter. Alaya ignores the momentary lapse and takes the glass canister beside him in hand, extending it towards Cornelius. “Take it and go, if it will satisfy our promise. I care not what perversions you desire to visit upon it.” He hands it to the mage without reservation. Cornelius takes the overlarge canister with both hands, his eyes seemingly lost in the great gift being offered to him and his face barely able to hold back a wide grin.
“And I will gladly take it. So you do not care what I do with it, correct?”
“Do as you will. For indeed, you have already written your own fate.” Alaya’s silent but heavy words fall on deaf ears. Cornelius is positively overtaken with glee as he starts to walk out of the room, satisfaction coloring the sound of his every step.
