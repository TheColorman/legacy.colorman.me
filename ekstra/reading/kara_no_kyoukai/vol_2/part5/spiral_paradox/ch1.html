    <h1 class="title">Spiral Paradox - I</h1>
    <p>
      Winter’s finally come. Much like how I could have used a bit more summer
      time than what was given to me this year, the town is also owed its debt
      of autumn. Even now, as I’m looking out the window of the office, the sky
      that hangs over the city is pregnant with snow threatening to fall. It
      almost feels wrong, like the order of things and seasons were manipulated,
      leaving little trace of the autumn that came somewhere in September and
      expired in November faster than one could have possibly noticed. During
      that time, in October to be exact, I was dragged by a relative of mine to
      a driving school he ran out of town, somewhere in the boondocks in Nagano.
      It was like some sort of “drive camp” where you stayed for three weeks and
      finished the curriculum faster than most driving schools. I was kind of
      annoyed to have to leave this fine city for a month, but seeing as I
      couldn’t turn down the request of a relative, and that my boss, Miss Tōko,
      gave her blessing for me to go, I didn’t have much choice in the matter.
      They ran that place more like a military camp than they do a school, but
      after three weeks of that miserable nonsense, here I am, back in my home
      turf, for good I hope. “Full name: Mikiya Kokutō,” I read aloud from the
      driving license in my hand. It’s smaller than an ATM card, and yet it has
      all my pertinent information written on it: my name, address, date of
      birth, and to top it all off, a picture of my ugly mug pasted on the
      front. The most innocuous but common form of ID that a person can get.
      “What do you make of this license, Miss Tōko?” On a bed in the corner of
      the room lies Miss Tōko. As I throw the question to her, I expect no real
      answer, but— “A contract,” —she does answer, in her usual puzzling way.
      She’s been laid low by a particularly nasty flu that put her temperature
      at 38 degrees, which is the reason for her current bed rest. Still, she
      seems as indomitable and alert as ever, proving that not even flu can make
      her sleep in working hours. That, or she’s probably hungry, seeing as it’s
      half past noon. Despite the window being closed, a chill still runs
      through the room that charges the atmosphere. It might be because we’re in
      the fourth floor, in Miss Tōko’s room to be exact; a room that I’ve not
      been to many times. I’ve moved the chair beside the window and Miss Tōko’s
      bed so I can better keep watch over her. I look over my recently acquired
      license as I contemplate the bad luck of my situation: after three weeks
      of driving—that is not, by the way, necessarily fun—the only thing that
      waited for me back here is a silently sulking Shiki and a sick Miss Tōko.
      While they claim that they have improved relations in my absence, one need
      only hear about Shiki’s complete refusal to help Miss Tōko, as well as her
      uttering of “Here’s to hoping the flu melts your brain” right to her face
      as she downs a glass of water, as proof to the contrary. The full name of
      that capricious individual is Shiki Ryōgi; a girl, though her manner of
      speech combined with her somewhat ambiguous features can make people
      understandably confused. The one beside me with a wet towel on her
      forehead is Miss Tōko Aozaki, my boss in the company I work for. However,
      besides Miss Tōko, I’m the only one employed in this “company,” so it’s a
      bit suspect to call it as such. She is, in simple terms, some kind of
      genius; and as is often the case with geniuses, is frequently lacking in
      good company. It seems that she has confined herself to her bed the entire
      day, though the fact that she is awake and not resting tells me that it’s
      more of an excuse for her to not work than through any major fault of the
      flu itself, though she did curse herself for not getting her shots this
      year. While I’m inclined to tell her that she should go get herself to a
      doctor instead of lying around here, I’m practically the last person she
      listens to. She said to me once that mages are often obstinate people, and
      as a mage herself, she is probably one of the most obstinate of them all.
      It’s precisely that sort of pride that stops her from just going to a
      doctor, loathe as she is to surrender herself to the care of any sort of
      “expert.” And so I resigned myself to not being able to meet Shiki and
      nursing Miss Tōko back to health, at least for now. “A contract.” She
      repeats her half-hearted answer as she retrieves her glasses near her
      pillow. Her back-length red hair, regularly tied back in a ponytail, is
      untied today for convenience. Under normal circumstances you’d first
      notice her stern and even slightly ominous character, but in the current
      situation, I can recognize how pretty she is, almost enough for me to
      ascribe her as a different person. No doubt to prevent herself from
      falling asleep, she continues the conversation. “What that is,” she points
      to my license, “is a sort of contract for you having learned how to drive.
      This whole country is upside down, nowadays. You don’t study to learn
      anymore. You study to get the test results. And as soon as you get your
      results, the meaning of everything you learned just fades away. It doesn’t
      tell you anything, except for the fact that you learned something to a
      certain shallow degree. It’s just a contract. The reason and the result
      are all mixed up. It’s like a paradox, isn’t it?” She raises herself up
      from the bed and rests her back on the headboard as I respond. “But isn’t
      that what results are for? I mean, everyone studies for one reason or
      another.” “Of course the opposite is also true. It’s reached such a state
      where the goal and the result, the act and its impetus can be flipped and
      switched around. Just as there are people who drive right after they have
      a license, so there will also be people who will obtain a license after
      they’ve already learned to drive, and so ace the test.” Miss Tōko is
      normally much more polite than her usual self with her glasses on, but
      today, possibly because of her fever, she is even more so. I’ve long
      learned to treasure such rare moments. Normally, she’d use that last
      sentence to point to herself—considering that I know she took the written
      and practical exam with little trouble or error, so much so that the
      instructor just glared and sniffed at her—to lord her authority. Still, I
      feel like it’s not the same without her citing stories of her genius past,
      so I feel compelled to point it out for her. “I know you were one of those
      who didn’t even need to take lessons, weren’t you, Miss Tōko? Hmm, the
      image of you going to one of those schools is kind of—” —disturbing. And
      funny. I can’t even imagine it. Sensing the gist of the unsaid words, Miss
      Tōko glares at me and gives the best scowl she can manage in her
      condition. “Come now, Mikiya. I was a student back then and it wouldn’t
      have been so out of place for me to go to one. The way you swallowed your
      words just now, you’d think I had four ears and a tail.” She furrows her
      brow and closes her eyes in an apparent show of dissatisfaction. I never
      really thought about it before, but I suppose Miss Tōko had her teenage
      years too. As I think that, the image of a prim and proper student version
      of Miss Tōko pops unbidden into my head, and it makes me gulp, and my
      heart skip; I can’t exactly pin down whether it’s because of fear or
      humor. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but the image my mind is conjuring up looks like
      you from another dimension.” “Oh, I see how this is. Now that I’m sick,
      you show you’re true colors, hmm?” That forces a little chuckle on me. I’d
      have to do that, seeing as all the humor is usually aimed at me. I have to
      scale the balance of power somehow. I stand up to replace the towel on her
      forehead, which elicits a triggered response from her: “I’m starving. Go.
      Cook.” Regrettably, the congee she had this morning is already being
      digested in her stomach, leaving no food immediately at hand. “We’ll have
      to order take-out. The udon with eggs from Kongetsu sound fine?” “Aww, no.
      I’ve eaten that enough times to know exactly how many sips it takes before
      it cools down. C’mon, Mikiya, just cook something already. You’re a happy
      bachelor with your own place, so you should be able to whip something up
      right?” I want to have a talk with whoever popularized that suspicious
      correlation. Regardless, I shrug my shoulders even as Miss Tōko looks on
      me with eyes filled with the expectation of delicious gourmet food, and I
      reveal to her the cruel truth. “Well, unless you want nothing but noodles,
      I can’t do anything for you ma’am. At worst, it’ll be some college-staple
      instant stuff; at best, it’ll be simple pasta. If that’s fine with you,
      then hey, let me in the kitchen.” She frowns almost instantly. “What about
      the congee you made this morning? That wasn’t some supermarket congee, I
      can tell you that much.” “You’ll have to thank Shiki for that one. She
      doesn’t cook much, but she’s pretty good when it comes to Japanese food.”
      Miss Tōko lets out a low hum, I suppose indicating her surprise. Shiki
      being able to cook isn’t actually such a great surprise if you think about
      it. She was a spoiled brat of the Ryōgi family, who are known for their
      traditional…well, everything. And so Shiki’s palate must be similarly
      adjusted. She eats pretty much anything, but I guess it’s only because
      she’s learned to forgive the plebian tastes of the food that everyone
      aside from her makes. When she makes food, it’s on a level that she can
      personally call good, so it’s really just natural that she’s so
      well-practiced in it. “It’s kind of surprising that Shiki would do
      anything for me. But I guess, considering how well she handles that knife
      of hers, it isn’t really out of place when she uses it for something other
      than stabbing.” She produces a long sigh of disappointment. “Well, since
      there’s nothing to be done about it, how about for now you get me those
      medicine bottles on top of my desk, Mikiya?” After begrudgingly accepting
      that she’s not getting to freeload a meal, Miss Tōko lies back down on the
      bed. I approach her desk to retrieve the three medicine bottles on top of
      it, but something catches my eye. A photo is propped up on top of the
      desk, showing what I’m sure is some country that is not Japan. A
      cobblestone path frames the bottom of the picture, and in the background
      is a famous clock tower. The sky that is captured in the frame is the same
      sort of snow-threatening gray overcast that plagues the city today., and
      below it in the center foreground, three individuals stand beside each
      other, two men, one woman. Both men are imposingly tall, but only one of
      them seems Japanese. The other exudes an air of someone at home in the
      place, without a single mote of unsuitability or discomfort. The Japanese
      man in the photo has cruel features that, even in a photograph, command
      respect. His face is partially obscured, though not enough to hide his
      appearance, but it gives me a sense of disquiet to just look at him, as if
      he could leap out of the page through sheer force of presence. My chest
      tightens as I think in passing that he seems familiar; makes me think
      about that rainy night that I’ll never forget— As I edge my face closer to
      the picture to get a better look at him, my attention is drawn to
      something else. Between the Japanese man in a black coat, and the blond,
      blue-eyed man in a red coat stands a young girl. She sports an ebony mane
      that makes the Japanese man’s coat look faded in comparison, and it
      stretches all the way below her waist. Her features tell of a peaceful,
      resplendent teenager, seemingly born from a cross between a hidden flower
      grown in darkness and a benevolent spirit’s visage. “Miss Tōko,” I utter
      unwittingly, “what’s this picture about?” I hear her rustle on the bed to
      turn to me, though I don’t see it, still engrossed at the two clashing
      images in the photo. “Oh, that? They were…old friends. I’d started to
      forget their faces, so I took a picture out of the old album to reminisce.
      That one’s from when I was in London, the place that was witness to my
      first and only mistake.” I don’t fail to note that Miss Tōko’s voice has
      changed, and a quick glance toward her confirms that her glasses aren’t
      worn but are placed on the bedside table. Though she says it’s only her
      personality changing, not her identity (unlike a certain other old friend
      I know), it really makes little difference from my point of view. Miss
      Tōko without glasses is, in a word, cold; with the speech, ideas, and
      actions to back it up. Despite working for her for months now, I’ve never
      gotten used to it once. “Let’s see, how far back was this again?” she
      wonders. “Must’ve been ‘round the time my sister got into high school, so
      it must have been at least eight years. Always seem to have trouble
      calling back the faces of the guys in those photos. Guess it must be some
      sort of sign.” She turns away from me and lies face up into the ceiling,
      as if speaking the words straight into the air will make her remember them
      better. It’s a rare sight to see her reminiscing like this, just as it is
      rare to see her in any sort of illness like now; that is to say that they
      have both never happened. The flu must really be doing a number on her.
      “Wait, London? As in, ‘tea and biscuits’ London?” I ask, incredulous, as I
      set the three medicine bottles down on her bedside table, pull the chair
      closer to the bed, and sit back down beside her. She pauses to pop some
      pills into her mouth, then lies back down face-up and continues. “Yeah,
      that London. I’d ran away from my granddad, and though I managed to
      liberate a few bucks in the process, it was hardly enough for a living.
      For a neophyte mage such as myself, who had no resources or skill in the
      Art enough to make a sanctum of her own, there was really no other choice
      except to suck it up and get myself into the Collegium. It’s sort of like
      a university, with all the oldness, the shabbiness, and the academic
      snobbishness that implies. Still, I couldn’t complain. It’s hidden in the
      British Museum, a domain beyond prying eyes that nurtured many of the
      archmasters of today. For me, it was also a treasure trove of unexpected
      wonders.” The way Miss Tōko tells it, it seems as much to remind herself
      of those half-remembered times as it is to tell me a story. As she talks,
      I notice her growing only the slightest bit paler. When I interrupt her to
      say that she might have taken the wrong medicine or something, she waves
      me away. “Come on, Kokutō, this is a rare opportunity for you to hear
      about this, so let me talk a little more. Let’s see…it was kind of an
      awkward situation for a twenty year old girl like me to study abroad,
      especially since the Aozaki’s have a…history with the Confederatio Magi. I
      elected to study the runic Art, since I knew practically no mage was
      interested in it at the time and they needed researchers badly. Took me
      two years to decide that I’d done the best I can for their college, and
      another two for me to get my mitts on the original runes from the Thule
      Society. It was then that I finally got my own sanctum away from the
      Confederatio and their prying eyes. It was then, when I was engrossing
      myself in my soon-to-be life’s work of making dolls, that I met him. He
      had an interesting background as some Taimitsu sect monk or some such, and
      a drive to seize knowledge and the greater mystery that surpassed even my
      own. He was passionate, almost zealous, like hellfire given form. For the
      most part, he turned people away, and misery seemed to follow him
      everywhere. His technique in the Art was second rate, but no one could
      doubt his skill in the arcana he did know. I kind of liked that guy.” Miss
      Tōko squints her eyes in a look of deep consternation, and she must surely
      be envisioning that man now. It is a glare laden with deep hatred and
      pity. I barely understood her rambling, though I still offer a weak
      “Mmhmm” so as not to make her pop a gasket in annoyance. “So you learned
      how to make dolls abroad?” I ask to fill the time, though I realize that
      it is such an out of place question it is almost unintentionally
      hilarious. Miss Tōko, for her part, only nods and acknowledges it. I
      really don’t mind listening to Miss Tōko ramble on, but it really is much
      worse for me if I can’t understand. That’s why I think maybe it’s more
      appropriate for her to talk about this stuff with Shiki and Azaka and to
      leave me straight out of it, but Miss Tōko, spurred on perhaps by the heat
      of her fever, shifts the gears dangerously high on the conversation. “A
      writer once said that ‘a designer knows he has achieved perfection not
      when he has nothing left to add, but when he has nothing left to take
      away.’ That’s what I was trying to do when I was making dolls, Kokutō. I
      tried to make that perfect human, to ascend that indescribable ‘ ’. The
      man I told you about tried the same thing, except he used the soul instead
      of the flesh. He lived to solve that problem with the unobservable cat in
      the box, to see beyond the definite truth of the box and see the unseen
      soul of the ‘ ’ inside. It almost resembles that ‘collective unconscious’
      bullshit by that psychiatrist a long time ago. He thought he could reach
      the origin if he just followed the breadcrumbs, the little clues left for
      us here. We both tried to reach that origin, the infinite stream that
      traces out the source of all humanity. People now are so divided amongst
      races, and skills, and capabilities, and inheritances, that it’s
      impossible to count the plurality of it all. So much has been added, and
      so much to take away, so much that we can’t reach the origin of all these
      skills and ancestry that we like to label causality, and other people like
      to call fate. It’s become almost like a formula you can manipulate; add
      this ability, add that trait, and the wonders of deterministic outcomes
      gives you a life from the genesis of the genetic blueprint that is so
      predictable to that creature of Laplace that it becomes droll, and if you
      want to call it fate, then so be it. We’ve made too much of ourselves in
      the never ending human imperative for omnipotence. The four bases that
      comprise the helix structure that composes all of humanity are so simple,
      yet so complex as to comprise a spiral, cumulatively accumulating unto
      immeasurability until we all fall into a paradox of our own creation, a
      paradox that can’t be observed. That’s why humans and mages alike will
      never ascend to the origin they aspire to—so I resolved to make one
      myself. But it was useless. In the efforts I poured blood, sweat, and
      tears over, I couldn’t make the Platonic human, only a perfect me.” She
      pauses for a handful of seconds, allowing herself to breath. I perceived
      her rambling to be one long breath, a speech that sounded like she said it
      without knowledge of punctuation marks. The color flushes back to her
      face, due to the medicine no doubt, and yet the eyes which stare into
      nothingness retain their dim quality. She adds a final note. “To think
      that bastard is still trying it, even now. I know he was cast out by his
      mentor for daring to find the origin of a person. He is one stubborn son
      of a bitch to still be hopeful. One thing I hope, Kokutō, is that you
      never encounter that man in the photo. If that ever happens, run away.
      Fast.” With the last ounce of her strength, Miss Tōko lies back down
      peacefully on the bed and closes her eyes. In an instant she is fast
      asleep, her chest rising and falling with each whispered breath. That
      was…wow. That was some medicine, to make her ramble on like that and then
      sleep so contentedly. I replace the towel on her forehead one last time
      and leave the room as quietly as I can so as not to disturb her. I emerge
      from her room to the deserted office. Only the distant, keening noises of
      steel from the neighboring factories intrude in the solitude. While the
      shrill echoes crawl up my skin, I think to myself: I can’t hold true to
      Miss Tōko’s request. There is that little burrowing feeling in my mind, a
      minor tick that keeps saying I met that man two years ago. Though I can’t
      be sure that man in the photograph is really the one that saved me on that
      night. The memory of the night, the uncertain identity of the man, and the
      words of Miss Tōko are still six different jigsaw puzzles that I’m trying
      to solve while the pieces are mixed together. The peaceful atmosphere that
      had permeated the room only moments ago disappears in the disquiet that
      breeds and multiplies in my mind and reaches down to my spine.
