    <h1 class="title">Spiral Paradox - V</h1>
    <p>
      Unwittingly, before either my mind or my body could actually notice, my
      feet have already brought me to Ryōgi’s house. As I step in, I notice that
      it has not changed its dreariness ever since the last time I set foot in
      here, the day when I admitted to Ryōgi that I killed my parents. Just
      before I close the door, I see the sky already darkened, though still
      somewhat lighted by the faraway setting sun. The hour hand on Ryōgi’s
      bedside clock points to six, and as always, in this quiet space, the
      incessant ticking of the second hand eventually grows to become an
      annoyance, and only serves to exacerbate my growing headache. It’s already
      been nine days since I last saw Ryōgi. In that span, I’ve spent my time
      roaming the streets among the hobos and corner boys, all greeting the turn
      of the months to November with a silent vigil as they go about their
      duties. I barely ate, only pausing to look at the occasional newspaper or
      TV display for any news on the discoveries of my parents’ bodies. Perhaps
      because of the depths to which my life has suddenly sunk, I’ve had a
      headache that hasn’t stopped, and in fact continues to reach a new high
      every day. On top of that, my body has been steadily weakening, and all
      the joints in my body have become heavier every time I wake up from a
      supposedly restive night’s sleep. “What in the hell am I doing to myself?”
      I whisper to no one as I hug my knees close to me. I was never supposed to
      come back here. But now, Ryōgi’s voice is the one thing I want to hear.
      I’m scared, and I need someone, anyone’s help, and so I unconsciously
      brought myself here. As I wait in what seems like hours in the darkness of
      the unlit room, my teeth start chattering lightly, adding to the droning
      repetition of the ticking clock. It makes me not notice there is anyone in
      the room until suddenly the entirety of my sight is bathed in light. It’s
      Ryōgi, who had opened the door without my noticing. “Enjō? What were
      you…never mind. I don’t think I really want to know what you like to do
      alone in the middle of the dark,” says the voice of the girl clad in a red
      jacket over a white kimono. She doesn’t even sound like she’s surprised at
      my being here. Nothing about her has changed: from the hair with its tip
      at her shoulders, to her deep, dark eyes, to the tone of her voice. It’s
      still the Ryōgi that I know. “Still, you couldn’t have come at a better
      time.” She approaches her bed and places the long bag she’s holding on top
      of it. Then she opens the door to the room she never used or opened while
      I was here, and from it produces a wooden box of about the same length as
      the bag on her bed. “Sorry, but whatever you gotta say, it’s gonna have to
      wait until I finish. I just can’t wait to put this bad boy together.” She
      unties the knot on the satchel, revealing a naked sword blade inside. In a
      manner that tells me she’s done this many times before, she opens the
      wooden box and retrieves a sword scabbard and grip from it, as well as on
      oval shaped object that must be the guard. “Oh man, the scabbard sleeve
      ain’t fitting. And this is the only one I have, too,” she says with
      dissatisfaction as she slowly transforms the blade from its nakedness to a
      fine example of a katana by assembling it, affixing different things to
      the blade tang. After she’s done and has looked upon it with some pride,
      she puts it on top of the bed and turns to face me again. “Alright. You
      wanted to talk, right?” In contrast to how delighted her voice is, her
      expression is still nothing more than the plain indifference she has given
      me all this time. I try to speak at first, but nothing comes out. I just
      want someone to help me. And I realize that nothing has changed.
      Everything is as it was when Ryōgi first saved me in that alley, but now I
      can’t remember what I wanted to be saved from. “I don’t fucking know. I’ve
      done things, things are happening, and I don’t know,” I say. Ryōgi says
      nothing, only listening as she continues to look at me. I don’t think I
      have any other choice except to continue. “When I was wandering in the
      city today, I saw my mom. At first, I thought it was just someone who
      looked like her. But then I followed her, until she went inside the same
      apartment building I used to live in. It doesn’t make any fucking sense
      anymore!” I declare, my shivering becoming worse with every word. Ryōgi
      stands up. “So long story short, you think she’s alive. You’ve seen
      nothing in the news, so hey, it might be possible.” “No! I killed her, and
      my dad too. I’m sure of it. It’s the ones that are alive that are fake!” I
      say with as much vigor as I can muster, as if shouting it will make it
      real somehow. I don’t know if I truly believe what I’m saying. What did I
      see, then? I remember leaving the house a picturesque image of a
      blood-drenched nightmare, and yet who did I see go back into it? “Must be
      my mistake. How about an idea so we can solve it? Why don’t we go there to
      make sure?” “Wh—” “We go there, we knock on the door, see if anyone’s
      inside, ask. That way we’ll know for sure if they’re alive or not. I’m
      serious!” As soon as she says that, Ryōgi wastes no time. She immediately
      stands up and retrieves a sheathed knife from her table, putting it into
      her jacket’s inside pocket, and then sheathes a second one in a leather
      scabbard, tucking it into her kimono’s sash. The viciousness of the blades
      belies the atmosphere of Ryōgi’s casual attitude, which almost feels like
      she’s just going out to buy some smokes. It seems she’s determined to go
      with or without me. I was planning on objecting, but seeing her determined
      state of mind makes me resolve to at least not let her go alone. And so I
      follow her out of the room. “Feel like driving a motorcycle, Enjō?”
      “Somehow, I feel like I don’t have a choice.” “Good. I left one in the
      parking lot, so we’ll use that.” We walk hurriedly towards the underground
      parking lot of the building. While I’m surprised that a building this
      small has such a facility, I’m more startled by the motorcycle that Ryōgi
      shows me: A large, heavy-looking Harley with an attached sidecar, which
      Ryōgi proceeds to get on. Driven on by her lack of hesitation, I position
      myself on the motorcycle, start the engine, and start us on the way to the
      apartment where I used to live over a month ago. We arrive at the high
      rise a little later than I expected, in some part due to the fact that I’m
      not really used to driving motorcycles as big as the one Ryōgi provided.
      The November nighttime air is so cold it’s almost unbearable, and driving
      in an open vehicle didn’t serve to alleviate it one bit. But through all
      that, we finally arrive at the circular apartment, tall enough that it
      seems like it could reach the moon. Its strange construction—circular, and
      actually being two buildings connected—helped it stand out from its much
      more plain, four-corner neighbors. My former house is located on the
      fourth floor of the east building. From what I know, the west building
      never had any residents. There aren’t a lot of people living there to
      begin with, so I guess they just never got around to using it. I did hear
      a lot of people wanted to buy, but the owner was a picky one, and not at
      all social, so he only filled more or less half of the units in the thing.
      Apparently my dad knew him, so my family got in fairly easily as a favor,
      I suppose. “Well, this is it,” I say to Ryōgi riding in the sidecar. She
      casts her eyes upward at the building, looking suspiciously like she’s
      seen some ghostly apparition on one of the windows. “What is up with this
      place,” is the only thing she says. I leave the bike parked in the street
      in front of the apartment, and I lead Ryōgi inside the grounds. A concrete
      wall surrounds the entirety of the premises like one of those bad
      community elemenatries. The circular shape of the building makes it so
      that it doesn’t take up a lot of space, but the grounds with its
      surrounding flora takes up much of the lot. Bisecting it is the paved
      walkway leading from the street to the building itself. Wordlessly, Ryōgi
      follows my lead as we enter. Inside, we can immediately spot the large
      central column that dominates the structure like an ancient monument.
      Within it is the elevator, and around the elevator shaft is the spiral
      stairs that hardly anyone uses. I push the “up” button beside the elevator
      door to call it. Somewhere, a clock’s second hand ticks. Something doesn’t
      feel right. My heart is beating at a rate much higher than it does
      normally, and my breathing is labored. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. I
      mean, I’m about to pay a visit to the family I killed. That’s hardly a
      recipe for relaxation. The elevator arrives. The door opens. I go inside.
      Shiki follows. I push the button for the fourth floor. A deep, mechanical
      sound can be heard as the elevator begins its ascent, a sound that I’d
      gotten used to hearing a long time ago. “It’s twisting,” says Ryōgi to no
      one in particular. The elevator stops on the fourth floor. I get out and
      immediately head for the hallway directly in front of us, leading to the
      east building. Ryōgi continues to follow me in silence as I take a hard
      left, following the corridor’s direction. Now I face the hallway outside
      the rooms of the east building, with the left hand side all having doors
      to their respective units, and the right hand side an open view of the
      outside world. A chest height wall is situated on the right side to
      prevent any nasty accidents. All of them are lit by the glow of the orange
      fluorescent lights on one half, and the other half the soft blue of the
      moonlight from outside. “We just go straight ahead to the end of this
      hallway to get to my house.” I start walking again. The whole place is
      quiet, save for the little noises that you can hear from inside the units,
      but it’s all background noise that your brain tends to filter out, and
      besides that, you never meet anyone in the hallways anyway. At last we
      arrive at the last room as the hallway terminates, and I stop my feet
      right in front of the door. Are we really doing this? My hand doesn’t move
      to reach anything, and my vision seems to blur for a moment when I look at
      the doorknob. Oh wait. That’s right. I have to ring the doorbell first.
      It’s an absolute rule, even with the key I have. If I don’t do it, mom’ll
      be scared shitless again. It’s all because of that one time when some debt
      collectors forcibly entered. Now, we have to ring the doorbell to allay
      mom’s fears. As I remember this, my hand hovers over the button. Ryōgi
      stops me. “How about we not ring the doorbell and just go inside, Enjō?”
      “What the hell? Do you plan on just barging in?” “This is your house,
      isn’t it? Besides, we ring the doorbell, I wouldn’t be able to see the
      trick, and that would be too bad. Now give me the key.” Ryōgi abruptly
      grabs the key that I produce from my pocket and inserts it into the
      doorknob, giving it one turn. The door opens, and inside I can hear the
      low hum of the television. Someone is inside. The sounds of a
      conversation. The buzz of words. My dad blaming the problems of life on my
      mom and the world. My mom hearing all of it in one ear and out the other
      one, nodding along to everything he says. The daily life of someone called
      Tomoe Enjō. Ryōgi makes her way inside silently, and I shadow her steps.
      We exit the hallway, and open the door leading to the living room where
      the noise originates. Inside is a cheap looking table, quite unfit for the
      how good the room looks. Or how good it would look if it was swept
      regularly and the trash was taken out. As it stands now, bags of trash
      fill its corners like necessary furniture. And in the middle of this
      entire scene are my parents. “Jesus, is Tomoe not home yet? It’s eight o’
      clock, for crying out loud. He got off the clock an hour ago! Where the
      fuck is that asshole playing around?” “Who knows?” “It’s because you spoil
      him that he acts like we ain’t his parents. That goddamn punk better start
      putting some money into the household or he’s gonna get his ass pounded.
      Whose house does he think he’s living in anyway?” “Who knows?” What…what
      the hell is this? Both my dad who hides behind the image of the fucking
      big man of the house even though he’s a coward at heart, and my mom who
      serves as his unflinching yes man are both alive. The two people I killed
      are continuing on with life as if nothing had happened. But that isn’t
      even the most suspicious thing about this. They’re not even turning to
      look at me and Ryōgi standing in the doorway, visible to all. “What time
      do you get home?” Ryōgi whispers into my ear. “Around nine,” I answer
      back, my voice stunned to incredulity. “Man, an hour? Guess we got no
      choice but to wait.” “Ryōgi, what the fuck?” I whisper, thinking the two
      would hear us. “Explain this bullshit to me.” Her indifference finally
      makes me angry, but she casts me an annoyed glance in response. “We didn’t
      ring the doorbell or knock, so they’re not treating us like guests. We
      didn’t trigger anything that fires up their predetermined response. So
      they continue their act thinking no one’s actually come.” Her observation
      finished, Ryōgi walks to the room behind us, across the hall from the
      living room. My room. After some hesitation, I follow her while trying to
      avoid meeting my parents’ gaze. There I could do nothing but stand and
      wait. Ryōgi chooses a spot on the wall to lean on, and waits like that in
      the room where the lights are off. But waiting for what, exactly? Nothing
      less than myself, Tomoe Enjō, and his return. And so I wait for me in the
      place where I committed murder. Not the most normal of times for me. Time
      passes simultaneously fast and slow for me, an eternity committed to a
      second, an hour where my sense of reality seems to slip away as the second
      hand on a clock ticks away somewhere beyond my reach. And then at last, I
      hear the door open. Finally, I’ve come home. A sense of relief and dread
      at the same time, two paradoxical emotions combine as I watch another me
      enter the house without a word, not venturing to converse with my parents,
      and enter my room in silence. All of it is the same: The wavy red-dyed
      hair, the body and face that made everyone call me a girl up until junior
      high, the sullen look that cursed the world, and the deep breath taken
      upon entering the seclusion of the room; a meditative act, almost a
      ritual, that seemed to will all the troubles away. Tomoe-the-other pays as
      much attention to Ryōgi and me standing by the wall as he would invisible
      specters. He lays out the mattress. My mind is blank as I watch Tomoe Enjō
      fall asleep, even though I’ve seen all of this before. I know what happens
      next. The sounds of an argument fill the room across the hall. It’s my
      mom, raising her voice to dad in what must be the first time ever. Then
      inhuman screaming. Both of them, baying like wild dogs. Then the
      unpleasant sound of a hard and metallic object making impact with
      something fleshy. After that, only my mom’s desperate breathing can be
      heard through the door. Footsteps, repeating over and over. The clock
      ticking and ticking. “No,” I whisper, though I know it won’t change
      anything. After all, I’ve seen this before. The door slides open, and
      Tomoe dares to open his eyes for a peek, and he sees the silhouette of his
      mother holding a broad kitchen knife in one hand. “Die, Tomoe.” Her voice
      detached, feeling nothing, but perhaps this isn’t true. After all, Tomoe
      can’t see her face against the light, but now Tomoe can see. Mom is
      crying. And yet, she goes on to stab him as if possessed with reckless
      strength, each stab strangely in time with the sound of the second hand’s
      progress around the face of the clock. In the stomach, the chest, the
      neck, both arms and legs, the thighs, each finger, both ears, through the
      nose, a stab on each eye, and finally, on the forehead. It is then that
      the knife breaks, and mom puts the broken blade on her own neck, stabs,
      then twists. Both she and the knife fall to the floor in a dull sound that
      nevertheless manages an echo in the room. Then nothing. Only the eternally
      reverberating sound of the ticking, growing louder and louder in my mind
      like a mocking tone. This is— “—a bad dream.” That became real at last. Or
      whatever level of reality this is. The sight makes me sick to my stomach,
      but I am delayed from any further thoughts when I hear the sound of a
      kimono fluttering as it moves. Ryōgi moves to leave the room. “If your
      curiosity is sated, then we can go. We have no business left here.” “No
      business?! A person just—I just died here!” “Did you really? Look closely
      and you’ll see there’s not a drop of blood on them. They’ll just wake up
      right as rain in the morning. It’s a cycle where they’re born in the
      morning and die at night. Get a grip on yourself, Enjō. You’re the one
      alive. That—” she points to the corpse “—is the one with a lot more holes
      in his body.” I turn my head to look at the tragedy one more time, and
      just like Ryōgi said, no blood on any of them even though there should
      have been gallons of the stuff. “What, how—” “Hey, I’m as clueless as you
      as to how and why someone would do something like this, but at any rate,
      we’ve got nothing more to do here. C’mon, let’s go to the next one.” Ryōgi
      walks to the hallway and towards the door leading outside. I call out to
      her, though she doesn’t turn around to acknowledge me. “What do you mean
      ‘next?’ Where the hell are you going, Ryōgi?” “Durr. To the place where
      you really lived, Enjō.” She says, and continues walking, the briskness of
      her action dispelling the confusion I feel, at least temporarily. At
      first, having followed her all the way back to the central hall, I thought
      Ryōgi would get on the elevator. Instead, she goes behind it, to the
      opposite side of the hall, where the corridor leading to the west building
      lies. Without any attempt at solemnity, she passes through the corridor
      and goes into the west building hallway, constructed similarly to its
      counterpart. I suppose I shouldn’t have expected any less. I realize—even
      though I lived here for over half a year—that I’ve never really seen
      anyone from the east building go to the west building. It’s like some kind
      of common courtesy. We walk through the hallway, the open air to our right
      letting in drafts of biting, cold air that tells me how late it is. I
      glance at my watch, displaying the time as around ten o’ clock. As far as
      I know, no one lives in the west building, which is probably why only the
      minimum amount of lights are actually turned on in this part, and no light
      nor any indication of movement seems to be slipping in the cracks under
      the doors to each unit. Guided mostly by the moonlight, Ryōgi presses on
      through the barely-lit hall. 406. 407. 408. 409. When she reaches the last
      unit, 410, she suddenly halts, looks at the door, and starts to talk. “I
      went here on a hunch, based on a really small observation, really. Even
      though you said you lived in 405, I remembered that Mikiya said your name
      last. He’s not the kind of guy to mix the order of names around. So I
      thought that the Enjō family must be living in the last room of the fourth
      floor, room 410 in other words.” “What…” “You told me some time ago that
      elevator didn’t work for a while, right? It only worked when all of the
      residents were here already, like somebody gave it a signal. The entire
      thing is a trick to displace the exit by turning the elevator, to fool you
      where north and south is. The fact that it’s circular and it makes a loud
      sound when it goes up hides the trick. It’s also the reason why the second
      floor isn’t used. It needs the height of a floor so that it can spin
      around a half circle for the trick.” Displacing the exit? That sounds like
      a load of bullshit, but what if it’s true? After all, I wouldn’t know. The
      only thing I know is that when I get off the elevator, the corridor in
      front of me is the one that leads to the east building. I didn’t question
      it since it seemed so obvious. If what she’s saying is true, then I’ve
      been mixing things up, and I just didn’t notice due to everything being
      the same. Whichever corridor you go to, you end up taking a hard left to
      end up in the building’s hallway, and there aren’t any numbers on the
      doors, so you wouldn’t know the difference. “Then, this is my house?”
      “Yep. The house you were in for a month before the elevator started
      working, to be exact. After that, you were living in the funhouse we’ve
      just been to. Now that I think about it, the stairs must be moving too, or
      else this whole thing wouldn’t work. They’re spiral stairs, aren’t they?”
      I can’t even bother to give her a nod. “But all of that can’t be true.
      Normally, you’d notice that shit.” I retort, but Ryōgi, as always with the
      considerable amount of composure she can bring to bear, refutes me. “Can
      you still call this place normal after what we just saw in 405? This place
      is an enclosed space. All of the buildings you see from outside are the
      same four-angle mid rises with no great difference from anywhere you look.
      All the walls that partition the place are some kind of strange color with
      small patterns on them that you don’t notice but your mind processes and
      remembers. There aren’t any small inconsistencies, so your mind lets the
      obvious ones slide. It’s not the same as Tōko’s, but there’s one hell of a
      ward in here.” She puts a hand on the doorknob. “I’m letting it rip, Enjō.
      It’s the homecoming half a year in the making,” she says, a note of glee
      intruding in her voice. She opens the door. There’s no turning back now.
      The inside of 410 is consumed by a thick darkness such that both of us
      can’t really see more than a foot in front of us. In my head, the ticking
      resumes once again, and my body, and all my joints, reclaim their previous
      heaviness. “Where are the goddamn lights? Oh, here they are,” I hear Ryōgi
      say somewhere in the dark. In a second, a light burns brightly above. I
      gulp. But I am no longer surprised. Somehow, I knew it would be here.
      “Looks to be half a year since they died,” says Ryōgi in a voice that
      implies no surprise in her as well. Though I know we should be at least
      somewhat astonished, for the living room we have entered contains two
      wasted corpses. What few dry skin remains is hanging on their clearly
      visible bones. Most of the flesh has fallen off, dry decaying on their own
      in the floor like a pile of garbage. They look like bodies dumped in a
      landfill and left to rot, with eye sockets as black and empty as a cave,
      and faces that no one in good confidence can possibly put an identity to.
      Except me. They are what remain of Takayuki and Kaede Enjō, the parents I
      killed a month ago for the sake of one bad dream. But as Ryōgi says, it
      looks like it’s been longer than a month since they died. And then there
      is the other Enjō family that still exists on the other side. It’s all a
      paradox that I can no longer muster the will to resolve. Like Ryōgi, I
      stand here in the room, thinking and doing nothing except stare at the
      bodies, as if by looking at them, I could divine the exact time and date
      like a perverse clock. Compared to the dream that I see every night made
      real earlier, this is more final, more conclusive, so much so that it
      doesn’t even hold any surprises for me. A meaningless, worthless death for
      my parents. Even so, I can’t seem to take my eyes off the sight of the
      decay. I have the acute feeling of someone wanting to feel emotional
      without actually being able to. I want to be disgusted, to be startled at
      the very least, but no dice. The sound of the front door opening intrudes
      on my thoughts. “Spoiling for a fight, eh?” says Ryōgi, smiling upon
      hearing the distinct noise. She draws the knife from inside her jacket,
      and in one smooth motion unsheathes the blade. At that same moment,
      someone enters the living room without us hearing his voice or even his
      footfalls. His face is a middle-aged man that could have been anyone you
      passed by on the street, but containing a hollow expression that reeked of
      imminent danger. As soon as I think I sort of recognize him, he rushes
      forward to attack us. But that’s Ryōgi’s cue to meet his steps and
      dispatch him easily with one stab of the knife. A second later, another
      one—wait, no, three—no, four people pile inside the room, clearly with the
      same intent, but Ryōgi wastes no time. Moving towards them, she slashes
      and stabs with a dancer’s grace, reminding me of the spectacle on the
      night we first met, now made deadlier with the knife in her hand. In a few
      moments, it is over, and the entrance to the living room is soon covered
      with four corpses. She grabs my hand and urges me to go. “Well, the
      residents have clearly expressed their opinion,” she says in a hurried
      tone. “Let’s get the hell out of here.” I guess I can still count on her
      to be cool-headed right until the end. I’m still in a fair daze from
      seeing my parent’s corpses, but I obviously can’t ignore what’s going on,
      and it makes me let go of her hand. “What the hell, Ryōgi?! Why are you—”
      “They’re not human. They’re human corpses, that much is obvious. But
      they’re just puppets with a death wish. It’s fucking sick. In any case,
      less talk, more run, run, run.” I see her face colored for the first time
      with a look of utter contempt, but at what exactly, I have neither the
      time nor the composure to divine. Ryōgi runs ahead, while I struggle to go
      through the pile of corpses that Ryōgi made, observing that they seem to
      be a collection of adults and children that, to my eyes at least, look
      like a family. I burst through the front door that Ryōgi left open and
      come out into the hallway to find five more of these so-called “corpses”
      on the floor. No blood, like the four she left inside, though their
      injuries are severe. I suppose this proves they’re not really human, like
      she said. In the gap of time that we were separated, Ryōgi has already
      travelled to what looks to be just in front of unit 408, preoccupied with
      another of these corpses. Watching her from here, I can finally come to
      grips with how overwhelmingly skilled she is. The movements of her enemies
      aren’t dulled or delayed, but violent and human-like when they press their
      assault. But it isn’t enough to deal with Ryōgi, who dives and spins
      through the press of people, her movements almost too fast to follow. Each
      slash, each stab, each swing of the knife that cuts through bone, muscle,
      and sinew makes her look less like a girl, and more a force of nature, a
      white-clad reaper mowing down a path back to the central lobby. Despite
      the mass of rapid movement blocking most of my view, I see the other end
      of the hallway, with the light of the lobby spilling in from the right.
      Shadowed by this light, a black figure stands in the hallway. At first,
      with the stillness of his posture, I take him for some sort of black
      sculpture, but I soon realize he is a man, wearing a black coat. He seems
      different somehow from the corpses Ryōgi is dispatching. A moment after
      seeing him, I freeze up all the way to my fingertips, unable to move like
      a puppet that lost its strings, and I am overwhelmed with dread. I should
      not have seen him. No, that’s wrong. We shouldn’t have come here at all,
      so that we could not have met him and the spectral placidity that he casts
      over the entire place; the stillness that wraps around him like a
      tailor-made cloak. <h2>INTERMISSION</h2> The man stands unmoving in the exit of the
      hallway, blocking the one narrow corridor into the central lobby. The
      black long coat he wears wraps him in a shadow that casts aside the
      moonlight, making him look darker than the night sky. He only watches
      mutely as the girl in white dances and swirls to eliminate the opposition.
      As if feeling the gaze affixed on her, Shiki Ryōgi stops dead in her
      tracks the moment she cuts down the last of the corpses, the distance
      between the man and Shiki when she finally notices him less than five wide
      steps. That she allowed herself to close to that distance to someone
      without her even being aware of it makes her lose concentration, if only
      for a few moments. But that’s not the only thing about him Shiki notices.
      He gives away nothing, leaves nothing to be read on his face or any small
      movements, which are either so minute as to be unnoticeable, or else not
      present entirely. And it is this fact that troubles Shiki. A bead of sweat
      pours trickles down her brow, a chink in her otherwise calm façade.
      “Ironic. By all rights this should have taken place after all of this was
      completed.” The weight of his voice is overwhelming, almost enough to
      force submission with just a word. He advances a step toward Shiki, a step
      that left him vulnerable with an opening that Shiki could have exploited,
      but finds that she can’t. She knows this man means hostile intent, and at
      worst intends to kill both her and Tomoe Enjō, and yet her feet seem
      trapped in place, unable to will them to move. The reason is quite simple:
      Though Shiki hides it quite well, she is in fact quite worried when she
      realizes that her Arcane Eyes of Death Perception finds a line on
      everything…except the man; no trace of the lines of death, the mark of
      entropic finality that everything and everyone carried, and she could will
      into vision any time she wished. Shiki focuses on the man, just as Tōko
      taught her, trying to envision the lines harder than she’d ever willed
      before. Though her mind strains and groans at the force of will, for a
      moment she finally sees…something else. Square in the man’s chest is a
      mark, a line swirling outwards like a child’s drawing to form what seems
      like a hollow, empty hole. “I know you,” she says, the venom in her voice
      clearer than anything. Because for an instant when she sees the strange
      mark on him, she remembers a fragment of an old memory. A vision that
      takes her back to that rain drenched night of two years ago, if only for
      less than a second. The man replies. “Yes. Two years is far too long a
      time.” The heaviness of his voice forces its way into Shiki’s ears as he
      gently taps his temple with a finger. There, stretching from the forehead
      to above his left ear, is the scar from a cut, the same wound that Shiki
      had inflicted on him two years ago. “You’re—” “Sōren Alaya. It is the name
      of the one who will kill you,” the man declares, his face still a picture
      of stoic calm. The greatcoat that hangs down from his shoulders has the
      unusual effect of making him look like some archaic sorcerer. The sleeves
      move as he slowly raises his arm, pointing it towards Shiki in a motion
      that makes her think that he would attempt to seize her neck, though he is
      still well enough away for that. She adjusts her stance in response,
      widening the spacing between her legs just so, and she readies her
      off-hand below her knife’s pommel, ready to add any additional thrusting
      force when needed. “Your welcome is in poor taste,” Shiki mocks. “What the
      hell is this apartment all about?” She shouts this, in part perhaps to
      contain the first genuine fear that she has ever felt in her life. In a
      rumbling tone that is more indulgent than acquiescent, Alaya answers. “You
      will not find any grand designs or vast-reaching conspiracies, if that is
      what you are looking for. It is what it is: a product of my own will.”
      “Then I take it this business of recurring lives is all just a harmless
      hobby of yours, right?” Her gaze at the man is as unmoving as he is as
      they exchange words. “Though at present incomplete, I have created a world
      that lasts for only a day. However, life and death alone is not enough to
      describe a ryōgi, and composed as it is with people of different lives and
      deaths, it is certainly not enough to contain you within it, not yet at
      any rate. The cycle of death and rebirth is incomplete. It is, however,
      descriptive of the spiral of conflict, for to the Yin, I offered death,
      and to Yang, life.” “So that’s why the west building is full of death,
      while the opposite end is normal. You mages sure do bother with the
      weirdest, most meaningless rituals.” “As I have said, this is no grand
      design.” Alaya offers a glance at the boy still standing dumbfounded
      behind Shiki. No words well up from inside Tomoe Enjō, and he can only
      look at the shadowy figure staring at him. “For there is naught but one
      state of being for any man. Dead and living cannot exist together. This
      place is a paradox where none can find themselves saved by the comfort of
      the consensus.” Mentally casting aside Enjō, he returns his attention to
      Shiki. “This is but a simple experiment. I only wished to see if men meet
      their end the same way in every iteration. All men die, but the origin
      also tells us that the death is predestined. Whether the result is a burnt
      lump of flesh, or complete incineration, a man that dies by fire does so;
      whether his struggle is hard or he surrenders, a man killed by family does
      so. Perhaps he avoids the first, or the second opportunity that death
      attempts. But in time, it will occur, and only our tenacity determines how
      long we live. But a man who dies a thousand times…well, perhaps there a
      deviation, however slight, can occur in the hidden law of chance. But it
      seems it is not so, at least not through two hundred repetitions.” He
      recounts it with all the clinical dryness of a doctor. Shiki doesn’t know
      how he does it, nor does she particularly care, but all she knows is that
      this man is making the Enjō’s family needlessly kill each other every day
      in an “experiment” he doesn’t even seem to be too excited about. Something
      inside her is telling her to kill him right here, and the thought comforts
      her somewhat. “So they start the morning the same way, and play out a sick
      drama of their last day on Earth the rest of the way? An interesting, if
      sick, hobby. And I don’t think the greater scientific community is on the
      edge of their seat for the result.” “Do not make the mistake in assuming
      that the choosing of these families were in any way random. They were
      chosen because they were already fallen, broken. Their pitiful lives would
      have come to the same conclusion given time. I merely fabricated a hastier
      end that they would have acted out in a long span of pain, suffering, and
      misunderstanding, whether that be months or years.” There is no pride, nor
      any resigned sadness, in what he says. Only the curiosity of an observer.
      “Call me crazy, but something tells me they wouldn’t agree with you,
      though. Look at this place. Floors bent slightly enough to not be seen,
      but enough to fuck with your perception of balance; illumination that’s
      just dark enough coupled with a paint job with patterns that drill their
      way into your head. Anyone’s bound to go slowly insane inside of this
      funhouse, even without the magic.” “Fine praise, but lain at the wrong
      feet. It is to Aozaki that you must direct your words at, though she
      crafted it unknowing of its purpose.” He chances another step forward.
      Shiki aligns her knife toward the base of Alaya’s neck, and before the
      time to talk is dispensed, she asks him the one final question hanging on
      her mind. “Why do you want to kill me, Alaya?” At first he seems to have
      no intent to answer. But in a moment, he mouths an entirely unexpected
      sentence. “Kirie Fujō and Fujino Asagami performed quite poorly.” “What
      did you say?” Taken aback by names she did not expect, Shiki is at a
      momentary loss for words. In that moment of hesitation that Shiki let
      slip, Alaya closes the distance with another hostile step. “I hold the
      cracked mirror up to you, and you see Kirie Fujō, a woman who thrived on
      death only to cling to life.” He says the name of the woman who was once
      consumed by debilitating disease, not knowing when she would die. An
      individual who lived through a longing for death. She held the trait of
      having one soul, yet two bodies, inseparably twinned. And then, there is
      Shiki Ryōgi, the name of the girl who can feel alive only through facing
      death, holding it close to her like a beloved trinket, but never letting
      it consume her. She held the trait of having two souls, yet one body,
      their link now definitively broken. “The image in the mirror shifts, and
      you see Fujino Asagami, the woman that pleasures herself through the
      medium of death.” He says the name of the girl who felt nothing, and
      because of it, was stunted in her understanding of the emanations of the
      world beyond her. Only through the extremes of murder could she hope to
      gain the pleasure of dominion and the joy of life. Her dangerous abilities
      were sealed by the same dynasty through which she inherited it. And then,
      there is Shiki Ryōgi, the name of the girl could only empathize with
      others through the act of mutual murder, risking death, and fighting it.
      Her honed skills are granted to her by the same dynasty through which she
      inherited it. “On the precipice of death, Kirie Fujō chose the end, while
      you chose life. In the taking of lives, Fujino Asagami took pleasure,
      while you gave it weight and meaning. Surely your similarities and your
      differences as murderers have not escaped your attention.” Shocked into
      inaction, Shiki can only look as the darkness of the man approaches her.
      “Two years ago, I failed. I did not realize that what I needed were
      different individuals with the same origin. Rejoice, Shiki Ryōgi, for both
      of Kirie and Fujino were sacrifices made for you.” His voice contains the
      first indication of passion, a voice that can barely contain the joy he
      thinks he deserves. In contrast, the willworker’s face is still as solid
      as a stone, seemingly suffering from an invisible burden on his shoulders.
      “There is but one last piece to play, though there is little I can do
      should Aozaki read the move. Enjō Tomoe is an unexpected blessing, having
      stumbled back here from where my spells could not compel you to return.”
      “I’ve had enough. It’s clear you’re the one responsible for all this. Only
      one thing left on the agenda now,” Shiki murmurs, excitement keen in her
      voice. She tightens her grip on the knife’s handle. The man holds his
      advance and points a finger behind Shiki, where the corpses of the dolls
      that confronted her lie. For a fraction of a second in this act, the
      shadows seem to draw closer to Alaya in an illusion that throws Shiki off
      just a bit. “The void itself is your base impulse, your origin. Cast your
      gaze into that abyss, and find yourself.” Within that declaration resides
      an emanation of truth, a lacing of magic. Though it buries itself deep
      inside Shiki, she nevertheless readies herself, and shouts, “Out of the
      way or die!” Then like an arrow drawn back and loosed, she leaps forth
      with an animalistic burst of speed and murder the only thing on her mind.
      The distance separating them cannot be more than three meters, and there
      is little room to run in any direction other than forwards and backwards
      in the narrow hallway, which is why both of them are not even considering
      any sort of retreat. With the speed of Shiki’s leap, it won’t take more
      than a second for her to close the distance. She holds the knife beside
      her hip, aiming to thrust it inside the man’s guts. But the mage has other
      plans. He need only speak the words. “Fugu.” The air around him ripples,
      and Shiki is stopped dead in her tracks. “Kongō.” He holds a hand out.
      Shiki sees a distinct line begin to form on the floor below. “Dakatsu.” At
      the uttering of the word, Shiki feels even the very air around her halt.
      Shiki staggers at her sudden halt, as if her body had just been filled
      with lead. The line that her Arcane Eyes allowed her to see being formed
      moments earlier is now complete, shaping itself as three thin circles
      spaced apart from one another, radiating outwardly from him like the orbit
      of heavenly bodies around the sun. The outermost circle, being wider than
      the hallway, instead begins to cling to the walls as a crude design would.
      Shiki realized the trap she had fallen in, her movement having stopped the
      moment she stepped into the boundary of the outermost circle. Now she is
      as a white butterfly trapped helplessly in a web. “I shall take your
      body.” The mage advances, the ghostly dark smoothness of his movement a
      juxtaposition against Shiki’s earlier white blur of a charge. Now facing
      Shiki squarely at her front, she stands helpless as the man’s greatcoat
      rustles in the wind. In the speed of events, it is only now that her mind
      catches up and truly begins to grasp the notion of Alaya as a dangerous
      enemy. He extends his left hand toward Shiki, palm open as if meaning to
      crush Shiki’s face in a vise grip. “Don’t come any closer!” Shiki shouts,
      the words coming out in staggered breaths borne out of some unseen labor.
      But the same force that had paralyzed her now only galvanizes her force of
      will. When Alaya’s fingertips begin to touch her face, she recoils to
      avoid them, and through an amount of effort that even she does not realize
      she can display, she momentarily breaks free from the invisible chains
      that bind her and manages to move her knife hand in a violent swing
      downwards. Alaya’s left hand is cut from the wrist— “Taiten,” he says, and
      the hand that was falling for a fraction of a second does not complete its
      descent. Shiki saw the entire thing, saw the blade cut clean through the
      wrist like a hot knife through butter, but now she also sees no trace of a
      wound on that very same wrist. “Chōgyō.” Now it is his right hand that
      moves, and it moves unexpectedly fast, almost as if he was anticipating
      what Shiki just did. And this time, it succeeds in grabbing her face, and
      with that purchase he lifts her up in the air. Shiki tries to speak, but
      her voice is strained again by the same force that made it difficult for
      her to speak earlier, and it comes out only in muffled and choked noises.
      From that hand, Shiki feels an indescribably cold sensation that goes
      under her skin toward the depths of her mind before slipping through her
      spine and spreading to each pore in her body. And for the first time in
      her life, she feels the last, desperate stirrings of one who knows in a
      moment that she is about to die. “There is much yet for you to learn.
      Within my left hand are sarira, and not even the Arcane Eyes of Death
      Perception can see its weak links. A simple cut will not wound me,” he
      explains as his hand continues to press upon Shiki’s face like a machine,
      not slacking for a moment, nails digging deeper and deeper. He studies her
      with a look almost akin to scholarly curiosity. She knows that any rash
      action and his hand will force what strength he is holding back to crush
      her head. “I will not die,” he continues, “for I have awakened to my
      origin of quiescence. It rules me. How would you kill what is already at
      rest?” Shiki’s eyes dart around frantically, making use of the minute
      field of vision still afforded her by trying to find anything…just one of
      the lines of death on his body, however faint. Desperately trying to will
      away both the cold fear moving within her, as well as the pain of the
      continuous pressure applied to her face, she searches for an opening. But
      before that happens, the mage comes to a conclusion. “I would take your
      body. But perhaps I do not need the head.” Suddenly, Alaya channels a
      decisive, crushing force through his hand. Shiki can hear the groan of her
      skull and jaw starting to break. Her eyes widen as she looks and looks.
      There! Faint, but it is there in his right arm. Acting fast, Shiki pours
      all of her remaining strength to cutting that line, and it works. The arm
      is cut. Alaya only grunts, but does retreat a few steps. The cut arm, from
      elbow to hand, still stuck to Shiki’s face, but she throws it to the side
      and leaps back to withdraw. She takes a knee when she determines the
      distance between her and Alaya’s orbiting rings to be generous enough. She
      looks down on the ground and gasps for air violently, both the pain and
      the effort of maintaining her faint vision of the lines becoming a strain
      too much to bear. After a pause, Alaya speaks. “It is possible I
      underestimated those Eyes. The scene you made in the hospital should have
      given me all the information I needed. Entropy. Whether something is alive
      or dead makes no difference if those Eyes and the lines act on entropy.
      Even for someone of my origin, something still binds me to back to the
      spiral. And I wonder…how long until you even see the lines on my left
      hand, and it becomes vulnerable?” Seemingly paying no mind to his severed
      arm, he continues. “Those Eyes are wasted and a liability on you. You will
      be restrained before I can destroy them.” He renews his advance with one
      step forward, but Shiki has long been staring at the three circles
      surrounding him, trying to divine a key to victory there. “You would have
      been better served backing off when you had the chance,” Shiki warns,
      shifting her knife into a reverse edge-out grip. “Don’t think I haven’t
      learned a thing or six about wards. See, the thing about wards is they’re
      arbitrary boundaries, like the one those Shugendō weirdos supposedly slap
      on Mount Ōmine to keep out the womenfolk and their temptations. Can’t do
      shit about something inside it, ‘cause it’s the wards that keep something
      out. In other words, if the line is gone, it loses its meaning.” At that,
      Shiki takes her knife and plunges the knife downwards to the ground,
      striking fugu, the outermost circle of Alaya’s quickly approaching
      protective wards, whereupon it fades and disappears, “killed” by Shiki. “A
      foolish observation,” the mage says in rebuke, but even so, he quickens
      his steps. But this time, having reduced Alaya’s barriers to two, Shiki is
      ready. And the mage hadn’t considered that totality to which Shiki’s
      Arcane Eyes can apply. To think that it could even kill something formless
      and lifeless like a ward formed by the Art is something beyond even his
      most pessimistic predictions. And so now, even his movement is hurried.
      “However, there are two wards left.” “Slow on the uptake, aren’t we?
      Weren’t you listening? Your gimmick is done.” Still in a kneeling
      position, Shiki places her free hand behind her back to withdraw something
      tucked within her kimono’s sash. It is the second knife she had taken with
      her. As soon as she draws it, she flicks it with surprising speed towards
      Alaya. Like a stone skipping above the waterline, it flies just above the
      floor, singing through the air and piercing the second circular ward, then
      the third and final one, bouncing just once over the floor just once to
      gain altitude as it goes after the mage’s head. Alaya’s surprising
      alacrity manages to save him from a direct hit, but Shiki’s violence and
      speed of action surprises even him. The blade travels further down the
      hallway before settling on the floor. Despite his timely evasion, the
      knife still seems to have passed through an ear, cutting it clean,
      whereupon blood and meat and other non-descript fluids are visible. The
      mage grunts in pain, not from the injury in his ear, but from the shock of
      impact of something hitting his body full on, a white mass that his
      attention can’t quite yet parse after the suddenness of the knife. By the
      time he realizes it is Shiki who hit him, the duel is already decided.
      Shiki had delivered a shoulder tackle with all the speed and brutality she
      could muster—enough to break at least a few bones—before she deftly
      maneuvers her knife in a thrust towards Alaya’s center of mass. The mage
      coughs blood in little droplets, grains of sand pouring out of his mouth
      to stain the floor and Shiki’s white kimono. Shiki draws the knife out,
      red blood tarnishing its otherwise silver shimmer in the moonlight.
      Sparing no time, she immediately puts her free hand behind the pommel of
      the weapon to augment the strength of her next blow, and then brings the
      blade up to stab Alaya’s neck as hard as she can in a final coup de grace,
      though the victor is clear. The reason is simple— “You’re persistence will
      not serve you well in hell, Shiki.” —Her enemy isn’t dead yet. “Fuck!
      Why—” she shouts, though only finishes in her thoughts. Why? Why aren’t
      you dead? The mage maintains his characteristic dour face, with the
      notable exception of his eyes, gleaming with satisfaction. If eyes could
      smile, his are certainly doing so. “I have lived for two hundred years on
      this Earth, and not even the Arcane Eyes of Death Perception will lay that
      span low so instantly. Entropy already acts on me, faster than you might
      know, but if that is the price that must be paid to capture you, then it
      will be so.” The duel is already decided. His left hand, fist clenched,
      flies toward Shiki, impacting her midsection with a force that she is sure
      can crack concrete. She is knocked clean off the ground a few inches,
      coughing up as much blood as she had caused Alaya to earlier. Shiki hears
      herself retching, violent and miserable, and realizes that a number of her
      ribs are broken, and at least some of the organs it protected are damaged,
      before losing consciousness. In the end, though possessing the power of
      the Arcane Eyes and an affinity for combat bred into her, her body remains
      as fragile as any average girl. She would have fainted with even half the
      strength of Alaya’s punch. The mage seizes Shiki by the midsection with
      the one hand he has left and throws her against the wall of the hallway in
      an act that is probably sufficient to break all of her major bones. But
      that doesn’t happen. Instead, the wall seems to swallow Shiki, letting her
      sink and drown into it as if it were water. It is only then, after Shiki
      vanishes wholly, that the mage deems it fit to lower his outstretched arm.
      Shiki’s knife is still stuck to his neck, and his eyes seem to lose their
      fearful intimidation. Seconds pass, but the black greatcoat does not move.
      The mage’s body is dead. <h2>INTERMISSION OVER</h2> The morning of November 10
      comes, and still no sign of Shiki coming back to her room. She has a habit
      of not locking her door when she goes out, but lately she’s actually been
      locking it like she’s supposed to, which is why I can’t even get myself
      inside and I have to be content to sit out here in the hallway like this
      for hours waiting for her. As a matter of fact, it was only a short time
      ago that me and Akitaka waited out here together for her before Akitaka
      concluded that it was in vain and he entrusted that object in the bag to
      me. I’ve known her to let her evening strolls last until the break of
      dawn, so this isn’t exactly a new thing for her. But ever since she left
      the office yesterday, something seemed a bit strange about her. It’s
      because of that worry that I’m willing to wait for her until morning, but
      even when the sun begins to shift the sky into the dawning blue, she is
      yet to come home.
