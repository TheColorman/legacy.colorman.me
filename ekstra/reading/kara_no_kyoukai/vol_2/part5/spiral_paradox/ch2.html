    <h1 class="title">Spiral Paradox - II</h1>
    <p>
      A day later in noontime, November 8, the weather is still disinclined to
      change its depressing overcast tint, and it shares this gloom with the
      office that has no light to stave it off. The office is actually a wide
      space, albeit littered with many assorted occult trinkets and knick-knacks
      from Miss Tōko’s collection. Even given this, it’s too big of an office
      for just Miss Tōko and me. There’s enough desks for ten people to all work
      at the same time, and there’s even a sofa for any unexpected guests. Of
      course, the concrete flooring is a dull, gray, undecorated thing (unless
      you count the scattered artifacts and books as decoration), and the walls
      tell much of the same story, with no wallpaper to call their own, but if
      we had enough employees to fill those desks then by God this would
      actually look like a halfway decent and productive working environment.
      Sadly, today only three people fill this vacant space. Miss Tōko’s desk is
      by the window, yet the woman herself is clearly nowhere close at hand.
      Through the wonders of modern medicine, Miss Tōko’s flu was as good as
      gone when she woke up this morning, which she celebrated by going out as
      soon as she could throw on some clothes, leaving me to shoulder the
      workload. Today, the job is to order some of the materials we need for her
      art exhibition next month. I’m holding the list she drew up of things she
      needed while I sorted out my own list of people from whom I could buy the
      stuff on the cheap. She usually doesn’t bother with the grueling detail
      work like this, preferring to just show up and start selling. But I
      suppose this is part of what she hired me for. I spent the better part of
      the morning with one hand on her list and another holding the phone
      receiver, trying to negotiate prices, and then repeating the process for
      the next retailer, and so on in a seemingly never-ending chain. While I
      sort out the trouble and trying to decide whether I’m really busy or just
      painstakingly thorough, two other people are making the room their own for
      the moment. One of them, Shiki Ryōgi, in her unmistakable kimono, is
      sitting on the sofa with a look on her face that can only imply a deep,
      abiding boredom. The other, a young girl in a black school uniform, sits
      on the chair behind the desk furthest away from me, across the length of
      the room. The girl wears a head of dark hair that pours all the way down
      to her back, and her name is Azaka Kokutō, my sister who is currently a
      freshman in high school. Ever since she was small, she didn’t exactly have
      the best health, and so it was decided when she was ten years old to move
      her away from the city air and to entrust her to a relative. Since that
      time, we’ve only seen each other a precious few times. In fact, if I’m
      right, the last time we actually met was New Year’s Day of my freshman
      year. I remember she still had quite the childish disposition then, which
      is why when I first saw her this summer, I was quite surprised. I guess
      environment does have a role in your upbringing. She’s quite fond of
      carrying the air of some refined, well-to-do girl, and her demeanor has
      changed to become fairly active, with no trace of the frailty of body that
      characterized her early years. When I first saw her, I actually thought
      she was some stranger and not my sister Azaka, which can probably be
      ascribed to her changing so much in stature and appearance in the span
      between ten and fifteen years of age. I steal a glance at Azaka in the
      faraway desk. She’s sitting there, and close at hand is a book propped
      open, thick enough that it’s likely to cause a concussion when used as a
      blunt weapon. Her eyes dart from the book to the paper as she copies
      something, writing it down on a piece of paper; an exercise that Miss Tōko
      left behind for her to work on while she’s away. While the cryptic words
      of Miss Tōko still hang over my mind, there is just one thing that bugs me
      much more at the moment. “Mikiya, Miss Tōko has taken me in as her
      apprentice.” She said that a month or so ago, to which I vehemently
      expressed my indignation, but with her newfound stubbornness, she brushed
      me aside. Goddamit, I’d thought my family to be extremely normal and
      boring, but why does she need to be something as eccentric as a sorcerer?
      “Azaka?” I decide to take a break from kissing the phone so much and call
      out to her. She finishes what she was copying with one last, firm stroke
      before she levels her eyes with mine. Though she doesn’t speak, the clash
      of the temper in her eyes and her quiet, polite demeanor seems to prod me
      to continue. “I know that you’re on holiday because of your school’s
      Foundation Day, but remind me again why exactly you felt the need to
      travel all the way down here in Tōkyō?” “You really should go home more
      often than you do, Mikiya. Maybe then we could discuss this like a
      reasonable family around the dinner table.” She clears her throat before
      she continues. “The dormitories were set on fire, and that forced it to
      close down for repairs. They were requesting that anyone that had homes
      nearby to vacate the premises temporarily if possible, and so mother
      called me back for the time being.” She replies with a calmness that
      reminds me of my high school student council president—and not entirely in
      a good way. “Did the whole dormitory burn down?” “Oh, no, only the east
      wing it seems—where the freshmen and sophomores were lodged. The school
      hushed it all up so that it wouldn’t get in the news.” Interesting. Reien
      Girl’s Academy is known for raising the stuck-up little kids of some of
      the most powerful families in the country, and they certainly have the
      resources to keep the media in the dark about it. It would be a big blow
      to the school’s reputation and image…especially if it’s arson by a student
      as Azaka’s words would imply— “Dear brother, I do hope you’re not
      over-thinking the situation?” Her eyes narrow as she stares daggers at me.
      Due to some unfortunate circumstances that happened over the summer, Azaka
      doesn’t like me poking my head into any more dangerous situations. A
      silent, Cold War argument always ensues at this juncture of conversations
      between us, but I decide to dispense with it. “Heaven forbid, Azaka; I
      wouldn’t dream of it. But enough about that. What the heck are you doing
      over there anyway?” “Nothing that has anything to do with you, I imagine.”
      “Oh, I think you’ll find that it does. How do you think I should explain
      you trying to become a…what was it…sorcerer, mage…whatever you call
      yourselves! How well would that go over with dad, huh?” “Oh, so you will
      show your face in the house after all.” Damn. She’s got me there. She
      knows that I can’t go back to the house ever since the big argument
      between me and my folks, the little brat. “And anyway, there is a
      difference between a sorcerer and a mage, you know. You’ve been working
      for Miss Tōko for so long and you don’t even know that?” Hmm, now that she
      mentions it, I do remember Miss Tōko saying something similar. Like how
      it’s better to advertise yourself as a sorcerer to neophytes because it
      sounds mystical and they love that, but that the two are completely
      different things, or something along those lines. “Yes, I’ve heard her
      spiel once or twice before, but there can’t be that great of a difference,
      can there? Both use that suspicious Art that Miss Tōko always talks about,
      I think.” “No, they don’t actually. The Art is certainly a departure from
      consensus, but in the end, it’s only doing what was already previously
      possible, but doing it in ways that are logically impossible. For
      example—” She gets up and walks to Miss Tōko’s desk, retrieving a silver
      letter opener, a favorite of Miss Tōko’s and one she uses quite often.
      Spotting some useless pieces of paper, she traces something on them using
      the letter opener. In an instant, it starts spewing some amount of smoke
      as it slowly burns. I watch the entire display without saying a word. Miss
      Tōko had once done something similar (though on a larger scale), but I’m
      at a loss for words when I see my own sister doing it. I guess I’ve been
      imagining this moment ever since she said she’d become Miss Tōko’s
      apprentice. “I’m sorry, but I gotta ask…is there any trick to it?” “Of
      course. To someone who doesn’t know, it might look amazing, but it’s
      really nothing special if you think about it. You could do the same thing
      with a cheap lighter, after all. Whether it’s through a lighter or your
      fingertips, the fact that you set fire to something doesn’t change. Not so
      mysterious now, is it? That’s what the Art essentially amounts to.” I
      suppose then that the Art is like a substitute for technology. But from
      what Azaka is saying, it’s probably better to say that technology has
      overtaken it. “Rain-making, for another example,” she continues, “is
      possible with both the Art and technology. The only difference is the way
      they go about it, but the effort expended is almost the same. It might
      look like the mage is doing it instantly, but what they don’t tell you is
      that there is still a lot of preparation. Once it might have seemed like a
      miracle, but now that’s not the case, just like once it might have been
      unbelievable to reduce an entire village to ash, but now we have missiles
      to do the same thing. In fact, that might actually be more efficient. The
      Art is only doing something that you usually can’t do on your own, but is
      still very possible, which makes it very covert. It’s not miracle working.
      The only miracles are things that are still impossible for humanity,
      things that can’t be done no matter how much time and money you expend.
      The ones that can make that impossibility possible are what we call
      ‘sorcerers,’ and what they have isn’t just a simple parlor trick like the
      Art, but ‘sorcery,’ or real magic.” “Then there would have been more
      sorcerers than mages in the past, right? I mean, they didn’t have lighters
      or missiles back then.” “Correct, and that terrifying capacity is why
      people were afraid of them. But it’s different now, isn’t it? The
      consensus has changed. There’s little need for the Art, and sorcery is
      slowly disappearing day by day. I mean, think about it, there’s little
      that isn’t possible for humanity. That’s why there are only five real
      sorcerers remaining.” Her voice lowers in a sadness that is beyond me to
      understand. The only thing I can think of that’s still currently
      impossible to mankind is manipulating space and time, and maybe given
      enough time, even that will be possible, and magic just a fading memory.
      The way Azaka tells it, it almost seems like a boy that was once
      captivated by scientific wonders, then became a scientist and discovered
      the sheer banality of it all. “Then here’s hoping the last spell is the
      spell to make everyone happy.” Though I say it to break the mood, the
      effect is somewhat lower than anticipated as she becomes silent then looks
      at me like she one would look upon the village idiot, then quickly turns
      her face away from mine. She chuckles a bit. “Sadly, even if that were
      true, Mikiya, very little actually have the capacity for sorcery now. I
      never wanted to be a sorcerer. Just learning the Art for my own reasons is
      fine for me.” “Wow, settling for something lesser isn’t like you at all,
      Azaka.” Azaka shakes her head while emitting a vocal tut tut. “Let me
      remind you that the Art shouldn’t be underestimated. And besides, the Art
      was once part of actual sorcery too. It’s only because of human technology
      catching up that there is an Art in the first place. I should probably
      rephrase what I said earlier. It’s not that I don’t want to learn sorcery.
      It’s that I can’t. Mages are creatures of long, storied dynasties,
      starting out with some kind of scholarly past, and then passing what they
      learn of the greater mysteries to the next generation, which repeats in a
      never ending quest for ascension. As it happens, I am not a part of one of
      these dynasties. Miss Tōko said once that she was of her family’s sixth
      magical generation, and that her third generation produced a magical
      savant, so even discounting age, she has a huge head start just because
      she was born into a family with a tradition. For someone like me, it’s
      more difficult.” “Man. Rough and tumble world ahead of you, isn’t it?” So
      it’s kind of like how people with a lot of doting relatives and a
      truckload of inheritance money get to have the best opportunities.
      But—“Wait a minute. Then how’d you get to be a mage when I know for a fact
      that our family never dipped its toes into any sort of occult or mystical
      stuff?” “Yes, that’s what Miss Tōko said as well,” she says, sporting a
      pouting look on her face. “But she also said that I’m one of the few who
      get it just from chance. She said I was good at igniting things, so…” her
      voice trails off again. I have to wonder what the hell her “own reasons”
      are for learning to light stuff up. For all I know she could actually be
      the one who set fire to the dormitory “Didn’t you just tell me that you
      can’t build up so much proficiency with just one generation of learning?
      Then why don’t you just stop aiming to be a mage and try finding a real
      job?” Especially since today’s job climate is stricter than ever, I wanted
      to add, but hold off on saying so as not to antagonize her further.
      Azaka’s mouth starts to form into an attempt at shouting the rebuttal at
      me, but is interrupted when the sound of a crash and a series of footsteps
      leap into the room. “Oh, don’t mind him going on about the economy, Azaka.
      You’ll get job offers before you know it. Give it two years and you might
      even be a museum curator!” The crashing sound was the door opening, and
      the footsteps belonged to Miss Tōko, who had returned. Miss Tōko’s
      footsteps have such certainty of pace that you’d never know she was sick
      only yesterday. After taking off her coat, she heads to her desk and hangs
      it behind her chair, after which she takes her usual place behind the
      desk. Both me and Azaka see her eyebrows come close together in a frown
      when she looks at her desk and finds the letter opener’s position on the
      desk has changed since she last saw it. “Azaka, what did I tell you about
      relying too much on tools to channel the Art? It’ll dull your skills. Or
      maybe you just wanted to show off in front of Kokutō here and not fail,
      hmm?” A beat passes without her saying anything, and then “Yes, I’m
      sorry.” The fact that she can still answer faithfully even while her
      cheeks are beating red with embarrassment is one of my favorite qualities
      about her. “As for you, Kokutō, it’s kind of rare for you to be talking
      about that kind of thing, isn’t it? I thought you had no interest
      whatsoever in the Art?” “What, you have my sister make kindling out of
      paper and think I wouldn’t have some casual interest?” “Point.” Miss Tōko
      laughs. “Anyway, ma’am, do you remember anything about yesterday?”
      “Everything’s a blank after I drank my medicine. Don’t tell me I said
      something embarrassing now.” She takes off her glasses and cocks her head
      in curiosity. “Erm…no, nevermind.” “Suit yourself,” she says with a shrug
      before producing a cigarette and a lighter from her pocket and putting
      them to use. She allows herself one deep puff before she continues. “Now
      Azaka, we need to discuss you talking about certain topics with Kokutō.
      Covertness and concealment are the best tools a mage has, and don’t you
      forget it. Well, I guess I can let it slip this one time since it’s Kokutō
      were talking about.” “I’m not sure I like how that sounds,” I interject
      out loud. “Oh, hush,” Miss Tōko hisses while batting a hand in my
      direction. “I only meant that you know what to talk about depending on who
      you’re talking to. You wouldn’t talk about the Art with a normal human
      being, would you? See? Praise! Who would’ve thought, coming from me,
      right?” “Thanks…I guess? Anyway, from what you’re saying, it sounds like
      regular people knowing about the Art is bad for business.” “It’s far more
      than just that. The Art sort of…loses it’s touch. Or let me put it another
      way. Do you know where the word ‘mystery’ comes from?” She leans her head
      forward on her desk, cradling it above her entwined hands. Her eyes imply
      the air of mischief that is always present when her glasses are removed.
      “I’m not entirely sure, but I think it’s from Greek, right?” “Yep. It
      comes from the Greek verb ‘mūein’, meaning ‘to close.’ It further evolved
      into ‘mustērion’, which means ‘secret rite.’ Both imply a nature of
      secrecy and a sort of eremitic quality. It’s an accurate reflection of a
      mage’s best qualities. They do this because the fact that a mystery is a
      mystery grants it a value and meaning. Reality deals with beliefs. Enough
      people believe that magic is gone, almost dead, and so it is. The fact
      that mages know this, and yet pursue their craft is what gives them the
      power to reshape reality to their will. In the most crippling paradox for
      mages, they cannot allow the Art to die, and yet too many mages will
      deaden it, make it mundane. Without the mystery and interaction of belief
      and disbelief, both the Art and sorcery, drawing their power from the same
      origin, would weaken, and the same thing will happen with all the mages in
      the world.” While as usual I can’t grasp the entirety of what Miss Tōko is
      saying, I think I actually understand the gist of what she’s trying to
      say. If secrecy and concealment are their watchwords, then I can
      understand why she was kind of peeved at Azaka a while back for performing
      the Art in front of me. “Then surely you use the Art when you’re in a
      place where no one can see you, right Miss Tōko?” “Nope, not even there,”
      she says as she snuffs out her cigarette on the ashtray. “Well, if it’s a
      duel, then I probably have no choice in the matter. Still, a good mage
      knows how to use the Art without breaking his hands. A smart mage knows
      not to use the Art when there’s an easier way to do something, and there
      frequently is. Besides, mages are all organized about this. When the Ordo
      Magi was formed during the medieval age and started regulating the
      tutelage of the Art, they knew from the progression of science that magic
      itself would decay. So they hid the Art, made it even more of a secret
      than it already was so that only a select few could study it in their
      Collegium. They police any leak they discover with some stringent
      punishments: Collegium assassins are sent to kill you if you involve
      non-mages in performances of the Art, a probable source of that prevalent
      myth of a wizard losing his powers when revealing its nature to people.
      Every performance is a risk of discovery, and soon most mages learned to
      perform the Art only when absolutely needed. Because the Ordo controlled
      many of the hallowed grounds with rich mana leylines, and monopolized much
      of the materials a mage needs for any serious research, the few rogues who
      disliked the decrees were at a significant—and self-made— disadvantage.
      Power of the majority for you.” “Erm…Miss Tōko,” Azaka interjects with
      obvious trepidation. “Does that mean that I have to go over there to the
      Collegium someday?” “Well, it’s not like you have to, but you’ll
      definitely learn faster there, I’m sure. And even then, no one’s going to
      stop you if you eventually want to leave mid-way. Though they may act like
      it many times more than most mages would like, the Ordo doesn’t control
      your life.” “But then, doesn’t that sort of render their efforts at
      concealing the Art meaningless? I mean, any random mage could just get out
      and spread the word, so…” Though Azaka finishes with a noncommittal tone,
      Miss Tōko nods. “That’s true. In fact, a lot of people do indeed enter
      with the intention of learning a few tricks and then leaving for God knows
      where. But like anyone’s desire to watch corny soap operas ironically, it
      doesn’t last long. Usually the sheer volume of stuff that the Collegium
      offers is enough to make them stay. To the serious mage, scholarly pursuit
      of the Art is supreme. Actually using it is a last-ditch scenario.
      Studying is what leads a mage to the greater mysteries, and eventually,
      gnosis. However, you have a distinctly different goal than most mages,
      Azaka, so I suspect the Collegium would just be poison for you. Still, if
      you’d like to take all of this a step up, the Collegium’s not going
      anywhere.” Azaka exhales gratefully and lowers her gaze, which thankfully
      tells me that she too is not going anywhere anytime soon. Studying to be a
      mage is one thing, but to have her study it abroad in some kind of
      eccentric college is one thing I seriously wouldn’t abide. “Question
      time,” says a lazy voice from the sofa. “Do the mages there keep secrets
      from each other too?” Shiki, who up to this point, had been content to sit
      quietly and stare at the scenery outside (and is, as a matter of fact,
      still doing so now), suddenly speaks. I’d assumed she just wasn’t
      interested in the topic, but far be it from me to assume what she is and
      isn’t interested in. “Well…yeah,” Miss Tōko replies hesitantly. “It’s a
      very balkanized environment, where you don’t usually reveal what you’re up
      to or what you’re after until you pass it on to your successor—if then.
      Secrecy is in the blood, and secrets are power.” “So you study for
      yourself to gain power you can’t use? You study for the goal of…more
      studying? Guess I just can’t understand what meaning there is in that sort
      of life, Tōko. I mean, it almost seems like all of these mages are working
      towards a net goal of a big fat zero.” For a moment, Miss Tōko can only
      smile bitterly at what Shiki just said. “Funny you should say that, since
      in a way, that’s what mages are aiming for. Some call it the ‘spiral of
      origin.’ Others like the ring of ‘The Akashic Records’ better. That grand
      mass of nothingness. Whatever you want to call it, that’s what they’re
      after. It’s where everything came from. And if you know where everything
      came from, you know everything that comes after. It’s not even enough to
      call it ultimate knowledge. It’s something higher than that. All the
      different disciplines and paradigms of learning the Art flow from this
      single, indivisible source. Whether it’s astrology, alchemy, the Kabbalah,
      Shinsendō, or runes, all their practitioners harbor the same goal. The
      first fortunate souls that felt its presence dreamed of its potential. It
      isn’t to sponsor the quest for the meaning of man’s existence, because
      they already know it. It is to pierce the great lie of this world and find
      pure truth, whatever form it takes. Mages of the ideal sort cherish only
      themselves to live a life that will never be rewarded.” As Miss Tōko
      slowly relates this to us, the gaze in her amber eyes becomes more
      pointed, and the color flickers like the flame of old ambition. I ask a
      question on the only thing I could understand. “When you say that they’ll
      never be rewarded, that means nobody’s reached this origin yet, right?”
      “Some have reached it. It’s the only way we know it really exists. But
      those who reached it never came back. They disappeared the moment they
      attained it. Mages think they ascended. No one can really be sure until
      you reach it. Because performing both the Art and sorcery means you reach
      out toward the origin, many mages think we have them to thank for what
      little of it we can do on this world, since they think that the mages who
      have crossed over become some sort of anchor for our Art to that side. The
      bad angle to this is of course, they could never have passed on what they
      know to anyone. The only reason ambitious mages take on apprentices or
      spawn descendants is, of course, to ensure that someday, their line can
      produce the means to get to the origin. There’s no end to their ambition
      and to their eventual disappointment. Personally, I think it’s just a
      fool’s game now, especially now when there are mages that are happy to
      just get in the way of other mages’ work.” Instead of sounding spiteful in
      her last sentence, Miss Tōko says it with a little hint of enthusiasm, and
      I manage to catch a dry, silent laugh from her lips, as if delighting in
      the fact that these nuisances exist. “Even if one out of the current crop
      of mages managed to reach the spiral of origin, they’d never be able to
      pass it on, never be able to give us new things to learn about the Art.
      The entire matter is like a fish floundering on land,” Miss Tōko says and
      shrugs in conclusion. Only Shiki seems compelled to speak out on the
      paradox Miss Tōko has just presented. “Never heard of a stranger crowd
      than that. I have no idea why you mages still cling to that false hope
      even though you know it’s beyond you.” “Maybe because for people who can
      turn steel into rubber and spew fire from their hands, they word
      ‘impossible’ isn’t what gives them impetus in their lives, or they’re
      deluded fools who just don’t know when to quit. Who knows?” Miss Tōko
      couples it with an amused grin. “Well, at least you know, so that’s
      refreshing, at least,” she says with just a hint of surprise. An hour
      later the office returns to the usual peace and quiet, with everyone busy
      working, studying, or in Shiki’s case, performing the necessary task of
      slacking. With the clock having just struck 3 o’ clock in the afternoon, I
      decided to take a little break and make everyone some coffee, except for
      Azaka, who drinks Japanese tea. The orders Miss Tōko requested me to make
      are done, and so it is with happy thoughts of a secure paycheck that I sit
      back down behind my desk and take a sip off the mug. The sound of four
      people occasionally sipping and then putting the mug down on a desk
      punctuates the afternoon silence. Of course, leave it to Azaka to refrain
      from holding the peace by asking Shiki the most unexpected of questions.
      “Shiki, are you a guy?” My cup almost slips from my fingers at the
      bluntness of the question. Shiki on the other hand, finishes her sip of
      coffee. When the cup leaves her lips, I see a face of genuine perplexity,
      and yet she shows no immediate inclination to respond to my fool sister.
      Azaka, however, only interprets that as a signal to continue. “Silence
      means consent, as they say, and that means that you admit you are a man,
      Shiki.” “Azaka!” I say sternly. Goddamit. I can’t believe I’m diving
      headlong into this. While ignoring her is probably the best tonic for the
      situation, the tactlessness of the question and its delivery can’t be
      ignored. I stand up so fast I push my chair behind me in the spur of the
      moment, but without any words of scolding to throw at Azaka’s way, I end
      up sitting back down in silence. The whole act of sinking back into my
      chair feels vaguely like what I would imagine Napoleon felt like in the
      retreat from Waterloo. “You obsess over the most useless details, don’t
      you?” Shiki replies. Already she has acquired a sour look on her face. One
      hand rests on her temple in her usual manner of attempting to dispel
      growing anger. “Oh? But this is important and necessary information, my
      dear.” Just as Shiki attempts to maintain her composure, Azaka also gives
      back with composed placidity. With elbows resting atop the desk and the
      laced fingers hiding most of her face, she conjures the look of a chairman
      presiding over a board meeting. “Important? I don’t think it makes much
      difference whether I’m a man or a girl, and I’m pretty sure it doesn’t
      concern you. Or maybe you’re just trying to pick a fight with me, hmm?”
      “I’d have thought that seemed obvious since we first met.” Though they’re
      not at all looking or even seeing each other, their eyes might as well be
      staring each other down. While I’d certainly like to know what in the hell
      was “obvious,” this doesn’t seem like the right time to ask. “Azaka,” I
      interrupt them again. “While it’s a mystery why you feel the need to bring
      this up yet another time, I will state the answer yet another time.
      Clearly this time, so your head full of magic can interpret it right.
      Shiki is a girl. That’s it. The end.” However, the interjection seems to
      antagonize her more than placate her. “I know that, Mikiya,” Azaka says
      briskly. “Shut up for a second.” Well if you know then what the hell is
      this conversation even— “What I really want to know is Shiki’s gender
      mentally or psychologically, rather than physically. I mean, her
      appearance makes her look like a man, but…” As Azaka allows her voice to
      trail off, she risks a sidelong glance toward Shiki, whose consternation
      continues to build to easily observable levels. “Whatever. I am what I am,
      and my gender isn’t going to change that. On the other hand, what are you
      going to do if I were a guy?” “Oh, nothing really. Maybe set you up on a
      date with some of my friends from Reien.” I gulp, realizing I can do very
      little to stem the continual escalation of force. Their animosity toward
      each other started from the day they first met on the New Year when me and
      Shiki were still in high school. I invited Shiki back to my house for a
      while, and that day also happened to be the day when Azaka came home for a
      short winter vacation stint. It was Shiki she’d met that day, the other
      personality with his boisterous demeanor and rough speech (perhaps even
      more so than the present Shiki). It so surprised and angered Azaka that
      she decided to sleep the day through instead of talking to me. Though I’m
      not really surprised to see Azaka still carrying that animosity some two
      and a half years forward, this is probably the point where she crosses
      some sort of line. I wouldn’t even be surprised if Shiki just wanted to
      hit her now. I stand up and start to say, “Azaka, give it a re—” but am
      cut off by Shiki rising from the sofa at the same time, and saying: “Gee,
      thanks, but gotta pass on that one. Those bitches probably can’t take what
      I’ve got to give, anyway.” Shiki utters a final harrumph before she turns
      and walks towards the door and leaves the office, the sway of her indigo
      blue kimono and the sound of her boots echoing in the stair steps the last
      vestiges of her presence. I briefly entertain the thought of following,
      but knowing her, she’d just get angrier if I try to be diplomatic about
      Azaka. Already planning my later burnt offerings for the miracle that
      nothing happened, I sit back down on my chair so that I can, at least for
      the moment, enjoy my coffee. Damn, it’s cold already. Whatever. I finish
      it off. “Aw man, she got away from me again. I really did want an answer,
      even if that meant she would’ve hit me. But her leaving without giving me
      neither is just dumb.” She adds a click of her tongue to punctuate what
      she just said as she visibly does a stand down from battle stations by
      leaning back on her chair and stretching, making the entire thing look
      like just one fun exercise to her. I’ve long since learned to selectively
      ignore the bitch switch that turns on in Azaka’s brain whenever she
      strikes a conversation with Shiki, but this time was such a close call I
      feel like a chat is in order. “Alright, Azaka. Let’s have an explanation.”
      “What? You and Shiki aren’t making this any easier for me to figure out,
      you know? Or don’t tell me you haven’t devoted even a second of thought if
      Shiki is going out with you as a guy or as a girl.” Though her statement
      is spoken clearly, I have a little difficulty interpreting what she wants
      to say until I see the copious amount of red blush coloring her cheeks.
      “Because I think it’s stupid to think about, maybe? Besides, asking a
      person like Shiki what their gender is when they don’t want to is probably
      one of the most faux pas things ever. And again, for the nth time, what
      difference does it really make if she thinks like a guy but is, in fact, a
      girl?” Azaka narrows her eyes and glares at me with clear suspicion. “So,
      can I take that to mean that as long as Shiki is a girl then you have no
      problem, right, Mikiya? Then help me out with something. Say two people
      fall in love with you—” I can’t help but snort, trying to hold back but
      gusting laughter. “—one of whom is a man who underwent sex reassignment
      surgery for trans women, and the other is a woman who underwent the
      opposite process. If they both love you wholly, madly, deeply, truly, who
      do you choose? The transsexual woman, or the transsexual man?” Well,
      that’s…difficult. The more I think about it, the more I think this is some
      kind of trap. Impulsively, as a straight man, I’d obviously go for the
      girl, but there is no such clear cut choice. The physical girl in this
      case has had a sex change to a man. Maybe this just goes to show how I
      just haven’t truly grasped yet that love isn’t bound by gender? My mind
      starts suggesting to myself that maybe I only do care about appearances
      after all, and slowly, I start to feel really bad about myself. Wait, I’m
      operating under the false assumption that having a gay relationship isn’t
      allowed. If I let go of that, then maybe I go for the girl, who’s like,
      actually a guy, but…oh what the hell, I give up. Wait a minute. Isn’t
      there a paradox in the premise? Isn’t this really a trick question? If
      you’re stuck in the mindset of gay relationships not being allowed, then
      it’s a question you can’t win. When I notice this and look up with a face
      of consternation at the other people in the room, Miss Tōko has a hand
      over her mouth, snickering and likely trying to dam the floodgates of
      laughter. “Oh shit, Azaka, he’s malfunctioning. I can practically hear the
      gears whirring and smoke coming out of his ears.” “Yes, ma’am. A little
      Epimenides in discourse never hurts.” “Dear god, the two of you are never
      boring, I swear. I do hope the entire family Kokutō are as crazy as you
      two.” While Miss Tōko begins to laugh her ass off, Azaka looks at me with
      an entirely serious look on her face. Oh, so that’s what this was all
      about. Well, I guess it’s Azaka’s own trademark way of worrying about me.
      Now, seeing as Shiki wasn’t clear at all when she and Azaka were talking,
      I suppose the onus falls on me to at least be clear on my stance on the
      subject. “Whatever you’re trying to say Azaka, I appreciate the sentiment.
      It’s just that I truly don’t care what sex Shiki may be. Hell, I don’t
      think I’ll change my mind even if she was still Shiki.” I feign an itch on
      my cheek to hide my embarrassment, but Azaka seems to take what I said
      quite differently because she stands up from her seat in astonishment.
      “Wait, you’re saying that even if she was still that…creep Shiki
      personality, you’d still like her…him?” “Mmm…yeah, guess so.” Not a second
      after I say that, I feel the sharp impact of something quite heavy hitting
      my face, leaving me dazed and confused for quite a while, during which I
      only hear Azaka say: “Augh, you suck!” Then the sounds of her running, the
      door to the stairwell opening, then her fading footsteps again. Once
      everything in the world stops spinning and returns to their correct
      upright position do I realize that Azaka threw that thick book she was
      reading at me. Azaka is gone, leaving only me and Miss Tōko, now enjoying
      previously unseen levels of jocularity, alone in the office as I adjust my
      jaw and rub the blunt force trauma inflicted on my face. Two more hours
      pass after that embarrassing interlude and then it’s finally time to clock
      out. Shiki and Azaka never returned for the day, presumably too livid at
      each other (or in Azaka’s case, at me). As I brew the last coffee for Miss
      Tōko and myself before leaving, a practice which had long become part of
      the ritual of daily work, I consider whether or not I should pay Shiki a
      visit in her apartment. “Oh, I forgot to ask you something Kokutō. Mind
      doing some supplemental work?” Miss Tōko calls out after taking a swig off
      the mug of coffee I just made for her, which significantly lowered any
      apartment visit chances in one swoop. “What sort of ‘supplemental work,’
      ma’am? Is this another case similar to the Fujin—” “No, no, nothing like
      that. I say supplemental because this one’s not getting earning you any
      extra zeroes on the check. Remember this morning I went out? See, I heard
      this interesting story from my cop friend. You know the Ōgawa Apartments
      down in Kayamihama?” “Kayamihama’s the reclaimed land that’s been zoned
      for public and commercial high rises, right? It’s supposed to be a model
      district for future residential plans in the city, or so I hear.” “Yeah,
      and a convenient thirty minute train ride from here, too. They’re planning
      some real swank apartments there, the likes of which you wouldn’t see here
      downtown, but what we’re interested in is this apartment that I worked on
      for a short time back when it was under construction. Apparently at around
      ten last night, a white-collar stiff in her twenties was attacked in the
      street; probably an attempted rape. The guys doing it somehow botched it,
      resulting in the woman being stabbed in the abdomen and left there as the
      suspects ran. Without a cellphone or a single soul in sight at such a late
      hour, she dragged herself inside the nearest apartment complex—the Ōgawa
      Apartments—leaving a blood trail as she went. But the Ōgawa Apartments
      don’t house any residents on the first or second floor, so she had to make
      her way up to the third floor before anyone could hear her calls for help.
      She managed to operate an elevator to go up the third floor, but I guess
      she couldn’t move anymore. She kept calling for help but nobody in the
      units paid her any attention, and she expired around eleven o’ clock.”
      Damn. Guess that’s what happens when apartments and condos get bigger and
      the walls get thicker that you don’t talk to the neighbors anymore. Maybe
      you can’t even hear anything outside, even dying screams. Indifference
      becomes the nature of politeness. Reminds me of a story I heard recently
      from a friend, when every single resident from a floor up heard screams
      getting louder and louder from a unit a floor down. No one knocked to
      investigate, and in the morning they just found out that the parents
      killed their own kid. When the police asked them, the people said they all
      heard it but thought it was some kind of a joke. “Here’s where the problem
      starts,” continues Miss Tōko. “That woman was shouting so loud even the
      people in the next building over were hearing her. It wasn’t even just
      screams, she was apparently really shouting ‘help!’ The people in the
      neighboring apartments ignored it because they thought the people in the
      Ōgawa Apartments would help her out considering her spirited appeal.”
      “Wait, you don’t mean—” “Yep, the people in the Ōgawa building swore they
      never heard a single soul. I’d pass on this one of it was the first time,
      but my cop friend told me this is strike two. They had apparently had
      another similar incident, but I couldn’t check it out. Regardless,
      something is definitely up there, and my detective friend consulted me
      about it, so here I am.” “So what do you want me to do, ma’am? Investigate
      the place?” “No, no, we’ll case the place together at some point. For now,
      I want you to see what you can do about pulling up a list of residents
      from the Housing Bureau, previous addresses, employment, stuff like that.
      Again, it isn’t adding any zeroes on your paycheck, so you can take it
      slow on this one, but I’d like it at least by December.” “No problem,
      ma’am,” I reply, voice brimming with confidence. Yet I can’t shake the
      feeling, despite Miss Tōko’s earlier waving off of the comparison, that
      this is going to be another weird case like the Fujino Asagami one. I take
      a drink from the bitter coffee, the mug now nearing empty. “Anyway, to
      change the subject…Kokutō?” “Hmm?” “You really don’t care if Shiki was a
      boy or girl?” Fortunately, my well-rehearsed image of office composure
      holds in front of Miss Tōko, because if Gakuto asked me that question, I
      would’ve been compelled to spit the coffee in his face. “I like Shiki, but
      if I’m allowed to have my way, I guess I prefer her as a girl.” “Oh, well
      no problem then,” she says disappointedly and shrugs. “I think I need
      clarification on what exactly that means, Miss Tōko.” “I mean that she’s
      definitely a girl, physically and mentally. Shiki is long gone, so
      technically speaking, there shouldn’t be any male personality in her
      anymore.” I don’t know if I really agree with Miss Tōko since Shiki’s way
      of speaking is still quite masculine. two years ago before the coma never
      spoke like that. “See, you can compare Shiki to the Taijitu symbol,” she
      continues. “We all recognize it: a big circle, white on one half, black on
      the other, as if each side is trying to consume the other one. And inside
      each color, we find a small point that is the opposite color, a black
      point in the white, and a white point in the black. It’s a symbol that
      swirls and dances in conflict—a spiral of black and white.” “A spiral…of
      conflict?” My head throbs a beat. I feel like I’ve— “Yes. Yin and yang,
      light and darkness, right and wrong, man and woman. The original reference
      is to the Chinese cosmology of there once being one, but from the one
      comes two. In onmyōdō, the Japanese practice of divination, this essential
      divide is known as ryōgi, ‘the pair of extremes.’” “Ryōgi? But isn’t
      that—” “Yep, Shiki’s surname. Her life with a dual personality was long
      ago decided for her. Does she have it because she was born in the Ryōgi
      dynasty, or because the dynasty long awaited the day she would be born,
      the fruit of their decades of efforts? I’m guessing the latter. The Ryōgi,
      like the Asakami and the Fujō, are just one of the old dynasties bent on
      creating an ascendant being by passing on their lineage, long tampered by
      magic and ritual. They see ascension as their birthright, but their method
      is decidedly less scholarly. Among them, the Ryōgi dynasty is particularly
      interesting. They knew that having psionic abilities or the second sight
      and other supernatural abilities would make them stand out too much in the
      modern world, so they deliberately developed one that is hidden behind a
      façade of normality. Say, Kokutō, do you know the reason we have
      specialists in the world?” Taken aback by the sudden shift of topic into
      the question, I become unable to answer. To be completely honest, I think
      my brain has suffered enough for today, and the amount if information in
      my head is about to overload. Still, I’d heard a little about Shiki’s
      family before, but today was the only time Miss Tōko made mention of its
      similarity with others, some of which we’ve had a run in with in the past.
      “That’s because an expert, any true specialist, dedicates his mind for the
      complete and utter mastery of only one discipline. You pick the one
      mountain, and climb it until you can’t climb no more. You make it your
      bitch. The Ryōgi dynasty understands this, and so they found a way to put
      any number of minds in one body. Like computers installed with various
      software, they are enabled to excel in many, varied things. That’s why her
      name is Shiki. The same ‘shiki’ in ‘shikigami’, the goetic theurgy. The
      same ‘shiki’ in ‘sūshiki’, meaning ‘ritual.’ It results in people who, on
      a whim, can transcend their notions of morality, their knowledge and
      skills. Empty dolls waiting to be filled.” I didn’t like how Miss Tōko
      summed it up in her last sentence. It seems to me a disservice to the
      person that Shiki is. Still, Shiki knew, and still knows all of this. The
      constant shadow of her unnatural childhood and rearing in a suspicious
      dynasty is probably the reason why she doesn’t allow herself to grow too
      close to anyone. “It was Chinese philosopher Fu Xi from whom the idea that
      from the primordial chaos of emptiness, the ryōgi, the pair of extremes,
      is formed. And from the ryōgi come the shishō, the four phenomenon, and
      from that, the hakke, or the eight trigrams. This might be another way to
      illustrate what Shiki was meant to be. She’s trying to let go of her past,
      despite seemingly being called back to it time and again.” Miss Tōko
      lights her nth cigarette for the day with the flash of a lighter’s flame,
      then points the cigarette at me. “It’s you who broke her, really. Crazy
      people don’t think they’re crazy by their own. They need another person.
      It was you, inadvertently or not, that made Shiki think unnaturally of her
      own existence two years ago.” She thrusts an unlit cigarette toward me. I
      don’t smoke, but I take it anyway and let it kiss the flames of Miss
      Tōko’s offered lighter, and put it to my lips. Recently lit cigarettes
      always have a curious and mysterious taste to them. “Man, I didn’t even
      want to talk about the ryōgi anyway, but look where we always end up, huh?
      All this exposition might mean you die tomorrow, Kokutō.” Miss Tōko says
      with a warm smile. “Don’t worry. I’m looking both ways when I cross the
      road tomorrow, all so I can spend another day working my ass off for you,
      ma’am.” “Good to hear. Anyway, remember those two little opposite color
      points in the Taijitu? White on black, black on white? All that says about
      gender really is that we all carry a little of the opposite sex inside us.
      Just because Shiki speaks more masculine doesn’t mean she’s more yang than
      yin. We all have a little bit of each other. Shiki is female. Her
      masculine way of talking is, I think, just a way to compensate for the
      Shiki who died. You getting it? She at least wants you to remember him.
      Heh, she can still be cute in her own way.” Somehow, I understand. She
      might talk like a guy, but she never acted as much like a guy as the Shiki
      two years before. She’s still pretty shaken up by the loss of him, and she
      never really fully recovered from it. She might put up a good front of it,
      and other people might be fooled, but I don’t make the same mistake. She’s
      still wracked with a guilt and loneliness that’s eating her inside out.
      The vulnerability I sensed about her has changed very little since our
      high school years. I haven’t changed much either. I still can’t leave her
      alone. And it’s been two and a half years since she was last so close to
      asking it, but when the time comes, I’ll save her from that life.
