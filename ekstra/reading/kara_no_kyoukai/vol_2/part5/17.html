    <h1 class="title">Chapter 17</h1>
    <p>
      Tomoe Enjō leans on the cold walls of the confined, claustrophobic
      elevator as it slowly moves upward. He stares blankly into space even
      though his breath becomes more ragged every moment. Ever since he
      cauterized the stump of his arm to stop the bleeding, his arm nerves
      haven’t stopped sending signals of pain. Knowing that his mind and body
      are both in the worst possible conditions, he is unable to think straight,
      his mind hazy and blank. It takes him serious concentration to even keep
      his breathing at a manageable level. He’s only ridden this elevator one
      other time, but even now Tomoe can feel it moving slowly, taking its time
      climbing the chamber, and making him grow impatient. Carelessly, Tomoe
      drops the sword. The thud it makes hitting the floor wakes him back to
      concentration. It’s heavier than he expected, and only an hour or so of
      having it slung across his shoulder has already made his arm numb. Lacking
      a second arm, he can’t even draw it from its scabbard, let alone wield it
      effectively. So he takes out the knife in his pocket and grips it tight,
      thinking it a better weapon for his situation now. Finally, the elevator
      stops. It’s reached the tenth floor. When the door slides open, Tomoe
      steps outside and into the central lobby. Immediately in front of him is
      the corridor to the east building, and on the other side of the elevator
      chamber is the corridor to the west building, unseen from here. Tomoe
      starts walking towards the west building, where the lights are off and the
      real corpses are left in their places. He walks around the elevator
      chamber, sees and walks through the corridor, and comes out in the hallway
      that describes the circumference of the Ōgawa Apartments. In a few more
      minutes, Tomoe knows, it will soon be eleven o’ clock in the evening. Here
      in the hallway, the view of the outside world is quiet and lonely. All the
      apartments and condos surrounding this particular one all look about the
      same. Below, sporadic spots of garden greenery mixes with the dull dark
      grey of the asphalt. It makes the entire scene look less like an
      assemblage of high-rises and more like a cemetery and its gravestones writ
      large. Though his attention is facing the night scenery outside, he is
      certain he feels the presence of a person somewhere nearby. So with deep
      breath, a bout of concentration, and a grip on the knife, he slowly turns
      toward the direction of the elliptical hallway, unlighted save for the
      faint blue glow of moonlight. There, separated from him by a distance of
      two rooms, stands a figure wearing a black greatcoat. Though the light
      makes it difficult to make out, the person’s height and silhouette leave
      little room for doubt. A lifetime of anguish has chipped away at the face.
      Standing here now is the mage, Sōren Alaya. The moment Tomoe confronts
      Alaya, he freezes. For a moment, his breathing normalizes, his pain
      disappears, his consciousness is stilled, and all becomes silent. He
      stands there, unable to do anything. But he is glad for this because it is
      a moment of respite where he can redouble his purpose. “Alaya!” Though he
      cannot do anything, and his freedom of movement is stripped away and
      limited, Tomoe speaks with confidence, invoking his opponent’s name as a
      sort of proof of equality. Trepidation will not be his quality this time.
      Alaya’s features seem to darken at this brazen act. “Why have you
      returned?” the mage asks in his heavy set voice. Tomoe denies him an
      answer and only looks straight at him and his eyes that don’t seem to take
      in any light. It is all he can do not to look away. “You have no place
      here. Your replacement has been readied, and your return was not a
      necessity.” Why did I return? Tomoe thinks. Well, the first time was
      because Ryōgi brought me along for the ride. But now it’s— “To save Shiki
      Ryōgi, is it?” Alaya asks mockingly. “Fool. Do not think your heart is a
      thing that belongs to you. If you have not realized it yet, you are a mere
      puppet. Do you find yourself unable to live, separated from this spiral?”
      “Wh—” “It is true that you escaped this spiral of an existence. The Tomoe
      who died, died due to the actions of his family. But that was not for you.
      You thought you escaped. You despaired. You even contemplated the thought
      of suicide, and you would have done so, left alone as you were. But you
      had a role to play in this stage as well. A role you were designed for.
      Tell me, do you know it?” Tomoe wants to scream and cast off Alaya’s lies,
      but cannot seem to summon the strength to do so. Instead, he stands there,
      unmoving. The mage’s face is unchanged, the eyes still sneering and
      ridiculing his inaction as he continues. “It was the final throw of the
      coin for me. And I succeeded, as you fulfilled your role better than my
      wildest expectations. Without knowing me, you brought Shiki Ryōgi here to
      her final act. Though I had the lowest expectations for you, you defied
      them. And though I reward you by removing the leash, it seems you must
      still come back. Make no mistake; you have no agency that I do not
      ultimately shape. You did not crave Shiki Ryōgi out of your own will. I
      only appended one thing to your existence after your first escape: to draw
      in Shiki Ryōgi and bring her in clandestinely.” Unable to form a coherent
      argument against Alaya’s words, Tomoe finds it difficult to remain
      standing. Because after all, he knows inside that it is true. How can
      someone like Tomoe, who had never truly loved a stranger before, suddenly
      find himself in love with Ryōgi? Ever since he first met her, he had
      already felt some inexplicable impulse driving him, telling him to observe
      her, and take interest in her. “So you understand now, do you?” Alaya
      says. “You gave a reason for Shiki Ryōgi to come here, but the decisions
      were never yours. You are but a mere congregation of the memories of a
      single day in this pocket reality. Nothing before, and nothing after; your
      so-called will an illusion maintained by delusions. There is no other
      place for your simple life. For you are powerless, and as such, unlike the
      fantasies you entertain in your heart of hearts, you cannot hope to stop
      me.” Now, as before, the mage’s words are charged with the taint of magic.
      The facts of his artificial origins, the one day of life lived over
      hundreds of days, and the delusion of the past he relied on and a future
      that he could hope for all come crashing into Tomoe’s mind. His feelings
      toward Shiki, and toward his dead family, his humanity: all an artifice.
      Only the exits and entrances of the one day drama he had lived
      repetitively remains in a weak emanation. And even that, Tomoe
      wonders—even that cannot be trusted. “In the end, you are not even worth
      my attention in watching you expire pathetically. Disappear, and never be
      seen again,” Alaya says in a deep, commanding voice. He seems to lose
      interest in Tomoe after he said what he felt must be said, averting his
      eyes from the boy. But against the revelations that Alaya attacks him
      with, Tomoe offers only an unprecedented smile. “The fuck you blabbing
      about? That shit isn’t as important as you think it is to me,” Tomoe says,
      but if it dealt any crack on the mage’s demeanor, he does not make it
      visible. “Being here in front of you now, I get it. I didn’t want to admit
      I was weak like you, but now I know I gotta face it. ‘Sides, real or fake,
      doesn’t matter in the end. What matters is what comes after it. ‘Least I
      know that I’m Tomoe Enjō. Even if I got no past, what matters is that I
      think I do. And for me, it gives me all that I need.” He chews with an
      empty mouth, but finds it helpful to his concentration. “I really liked
      Ryōgi. Fuck the reason. The ride was fun while it lasted, even though I
      couldn’t give her anything. And if you say you’re the reason for the whole
      thing, then I gotta be a gentleman and thank you, don’t I?” Tomoe clicks
      his tongue, remembering what he can of Shiki Ryōgi. It seems like a
      different life now. At least every time he remembers her, the clicking of
      the gears and cogs that placed him in the circumstance of his life seem to
      fade away. That Mikiya guy was right, Tomoe thinks. It’s more important to
      think of myself sometimes. He needed to come here. Shiki is only part of
      the reason. He had to know all that had been revealed to him tonight. Own
      up to the cost. Maybe find his own redemption in what little he can do.
      But I still gotta do it. Sorry about this, Ryōgi. Looks like I’m not dying
      for you after all. I’m putting my life on the line for my own self. In his
      mind, the apology is a whisper, and with just that, the thought of Shiki
      Ryōgi departs from his mind. “Call me a fake all you want, Alaya,” Tomoe
      declares. Alaya’s expression finally changes, though subtly, with the
      slight quiver of his brow. “You would go against your nature? That way
      lies foolishness and hubris. It will never change the truth of you,” he
      replies with disdain. “Maybe. But at least my soul is true,” Tomoe says
      with a quiet murmur, carried on the wind and echoing out through the
      night. “The time for talk is long past.” Tomoe nods slowly and
      determinedly, secretly agreeing. The mage raises his hand in his familiar
      gesture, like a signal for his enemy’s imminent demise. As soon as Tomoe
      sees this, he holds back the chattering in his teeth. He knows he will be
      killed. But at the very least, he can pay him back a few for the trouble.
      This isn’t suicide to him. This is for the sake of his parents, and for
      the sake of the dead and dying in this spiral of a false world, and for
      his own sake as well. Tomoe doesn’t want to die. But there are some things
      worth dying for. Time to run. To run and face the truth. Run with the same
      joy in my memory. Run like the hands on a clock, or the changing seasons.
      Run so that I don’t end up in the same place every time. Whether it’s a
      dream that doesn’t truly exist, it drives a determination that I know is
      real. “Alaya, I will kill you.” Gripping the knife tight, Tomoe Enjō
      breaks into a sprint. Tomoe Enjō aims to hit only one target: Sōren
      Alaya’s heart. He’d seen Shiki strike the same place with a determined
      strike, and he thinks that repeating it might proffer the mage’s death.
      And so, aiming at this, Tomoe runs, attempting to close the same six meter
      distance that Shiki once closed in a mere two or three seconds. He kicks
      off the floor with an explosion of strength, remembering the sprints he
      repeated over and over in the track in school. He will make this his best
      time yet. In the space around Alaya, a circular perimeter appears much
      like the one he deployed in his fight with Shiki. However, unlike the
      threefold circular ward that he used with Shiki, he only uses one, perhaps
      to mock Tomoe. This particular one only spreads out a meter away from the
      mage. Tomoe knows no way to avoid it, and so he steps right into it. With
      an arrested jerk, his body halts in place. The power that only moments ago
      flowed through Tomoe’s legs is gone in one disorienting instant. He is
      immobile, unable to do anything. Frowning, Alaya takes one sluggish pace
      forward, impressing upon Tomoe the gravity of the situation. His
      outstretched hand slowly takes hold of Tomoe’s head. No good huh, thinks
      Tomoe as he closes his eyes. But he refuses to back down. “My family
      didn’t deserve to die like they did,” Tomoe struggles to say. “They
      weren’t so bad that they deserved to be killed!” he shouts. He fights the
      invisible chains that bind him as hard as he can, not caring even if his
      legs might be snapped in two, as long as it doesn’t end like this. I’m not
      worthless. “I existed! I’ve lived!” Tomoe cries as he pours his last burst
      of effort into escaping. He hears a snapping sound, then a sharp tear, and
      then the flash of pain of a leg splitting open. He starts to fall forward,
      but turns that momentum into his last attack. Passing under Alaya’s arm,
      he lets his hand that holds the knife fly to the mage’s defenseless chest,
      the steel glinting and seemingly leaving a cold, silver trail in the air.
      And it hits its mark. But that is the only thing that happens. “You fool,”
      Alaya says with a voice tinged with regret. He draws back his hand to
      seize Tomoe’s head once again, unfazed by the strike at his chest. This
      time, his hold is solid, almost crushing. “You are not Shiki Ryōgi, nor do
      you have her Eyes. You do not realize that the knowing of death is not
      enough, for there is value too in the seeing. You cannot hope to actualize
      my entropy without seeing it.” Now the mage’s muscular arm begins to crush
      the head which it holds. Tomoe’s hand that wielded the knife is now forced
      to withdraw it from the mage’s chest, slipping out easily and dropping to
      the floor in a clatter, the hand that only seconds ago gripped it tightly
      now losing its strength. “You never knew the reason you were chosen,”
      Alaya whispers sternly. Tomoe does not honor him with an acknowledgement.
      The hand seems to rob him of his last will to live. “In your last moments,
      you have earned this knowledge, so listen well. All things have an impetus
      that drives and shapes their very existence. A primal impulse contained
      and cycled in the Akashic Record we mages call an ‘origin.’ I knew you
      would murder your mother, and fall into despair because your origin is
      known to me.” Again, Tomoe does not answer. Alaya holds Tomoe’s body up
      high by the head, and with a voice far too chilling, speaks. “Know this:
      you were never capable of anything. For your origin was ‘worthlessness.’”
      In the flash of a moment, some arcane power, like a command, passes
      through Alaya’s hands. The power enters the body of Tomoe Enjō, and he
      begins to fade from existence completely, disintegrating into the air into
      nothingness. After the destruction Tomoe Enjō, the mage Sōren Alaya stands
      stock still in the tenth floor hallway. He knows the time is close at
      hand. He has prepared the body he will use, and his soul is ready to be
      relocated, and he will finally leave this inferior flesh. Unlike the
      puppet master he once knew, his soul will not move to something similar to
      his previous form. He has no need of one, for he has never known death. He
      has known rot and decay, but his soul presses him forward to some grand
      goal, and so he survives. And in the end, he stands alone. This body will
      either be his medium for ascension, or death; for there is no other. Due
      to this, his extreme attention to caution can perhaps be forgiven. Not
      much longer now until he leaves this false material world, his soul
      sublimated to the vessel of the girl connected to the spiral of origin,
      from where he can command reality itself. As above, so below. The process
      has already started. But before this happens, there is one matter left to
      settle. “So you have fallen, Alba,” Alaya mutters in a lifeless voice. He
      closes his eyes. At first he is in the unlit hallway, but with a single
      thought, he feels himself fall through the floor as if diving through a
      deep sea, and seems to descend into slumber. While Alaya’s body remains in
      the tenth floor, his consciousness travels downward. Without shape or
      form, he observes the state of affairs in the lobby on the first floor’s
      east wing. Present there is the mage Tōko Aozaki, as well as the boy
      called Mikiya Kokutō. Tōko is nursing the fallen boy’s wounds, but it
      seems Cornelius Alba cannot be found. It is just as he expected. He
      prepares to return his consciousness to his body, but something holds him
      back. “Where are you going, Alaya? Scrying is in poor taste,” Tōko says
      with a click of her tongue. Though formless, Tōko looks over her shoulder
      as though he sees Alaya. She is at the foot of the staircase, while he is
      observing from the top. As before, they find themselves confronting each
      other. Hmph. So you did indeed have a second puppet as I thought. And
      through it you have disposed of Alba. The heart I plundered from you was
      real, I know it to be. Does this mean you are a mere fake? Alaya’s voice
      echoes throughout the lobby. But there is no sound. It is a reverberating
      voice only Tōko can hear. Upon hearing Alaya’s question, Tōko sighs.
      “First Alba, then you. Both of you sure like fussing over the little
      details. Always asking ‘what’s the difference between then and now,’ and
      never anything productive. I wonder how long you plan to take the
      questions this time.” The propensity of your mouth to utter irritations
      seems unchanged, at the very least. Then will you duel with me once more?
      “No, thanks. I’ve got no chance of winning in this apartment building,”
      speaking frankly, Tōko turns her attention away from the mage’s presence,
      deciding that nursing the unconscious boy is more important than
      maintaining her conversation with Alaya. She produces a bandage from
      beneath her brown trench coat and begins to dress the wound in the boy’s
      knees. Is your decision true? The familiar you contain within that box is
      capable of defeating me. “I humbly decline. If I just cut this familiar
      loose, it might well consume the entire building. The Ordo Magi would
      definitely notice, and they wouldn’t let that slide. After all the trouble
      I went through occulting myself here, I wouldn’t want all of that to go to
      waste.” Tōko doesn’t look over her shoulder when she answers him. “I lost
      when I died. I accept that. Whether you acquire Shiki’s body and cast of
      your own or not, I don’t care. If there were someone able to stop you, it
      wouldn’t be me.” Do you still rely hopelessly on the Deterrent this late
      in the game? I have told you before that it will not function. Tōko shakes
      her head, in pity more so than repudiation. “Maybe so. Maybe you’ve
      actually won this time. I don’t know what you’ll do when you reach the
      spiral of origin. They told us that the mages who reached the realms above
      remained, never to return to the material world below, sloughing off their
      memory of it like dry skin. But you fancy yourself different, don’t you?
      You’d reshape reality, cast your shadow here on this side. As above, so
      below. You think you hate humanity so much that you want to save them. If
      that were true, you’d will yourself from existence after your ascension.
      But you don’t really hate humanity, Alaya. You only love the notion of the
      Platonic human you think you harbor within you. It’s why you can’t forgive
      the world of suffering you see. It’s hilarious, too, how you think you
      want to save them. But you only want to save your delusional self.” Alaya
      does not immediately respond. At this point, any common cause they thought
      they shared, and what Alaya thought he could appeal to, is now well and
      truly broken. When he speaks, he speaks in a tone of grief. Then there is
      little else to speak about. For I see only one way to salvation. Farewell,
      Aozaki. I cannot leave any proof of my arrival at the spiral of origin.
      Only content yourself with the knowledge that you were the one that
      endeavored to stop me, and find meaning in that. The mage’s consciousness
      starts to fade from the lobby and the senses of Tōko Aozaki. Back still
      turned, she suddenly remembers a certain doubt. “Wait, Alaya. I have one
      last matter to ask. You made this facsimile of the Taijitu to contain the
      Taijitu, didn’t you?” Of course. I made this pocket reality primarily to
      keep Shiki Ryōgi from escaping. Everything else is an addendum to that
      objective. Though Alaya replies with an air of composure, Tōko starts to
      snicker, initially trying her hardest to hold it back. Unable to calm
      herself, the female mage begins to laugh loudly, and with mockery and
      humor, unrestrained and even somewhat disconcerting. “Yeah, this building
      is just one big pile of sorcery, isn’t it? A closed realm to hide Shiki
      and your experiment from the Ordo, from me, from the consensus. A prison!
      A prison to keep the Deterrent from acting. Up until that point, your
      theory is watertight, Alaya. But what a pity! You have committed your
      gravest mistake yet.” Alaya is at a loss at grasping the meaning of Tōko’s
      words. I made no mistake. His voice is without hesitation, a
      self-affirmation. Tōko tries to answer as she holds back bouts of
      laughter. “Yes. True. Perfect weaving, for any mage’s spell. But think
      back, Alaya. What if your assumption itself was wrong? You isolated Shiki
      not in a room in this building, but within the building itself, didn’t
      you? A spell bordering on sorcery that cuts her off from regular space,
      trapping her in a lemniscate space, rendering anyone incapable of
      escaping. A prison that won’t break no matter which weapon one uses. It’s
      a finely woven pattern for one versed in the arcanum of the wards such as
      you. You think you have trapped her, and your guard slackens. But you see,
      Alaya, it is no proof against her. We mages might be an abhorrence of
      reality, a paradox on the pattern of the world, but Shiki is a reaper for
      beings as uncommon as us. Even now, she works against you!” Her words
      unsettle the observing mage, and he feels his mind seem to stop.
      Certainly, Shiki’s talent lies not only in the killing of physical things.
      The many weapons that humanity has created are tools enough for such
      purpose. It is her ability to bring entropy upon things that don’t even
      know the concept of “life” as we know it, concepts and thoughts without
      form, bringing the ultimate void to bear. The one that brings entropy to
      all things. That is her ability. She is contained in an infinite span of
      nothingness. Without form, Alaya thought the space would keep her safe
      from anything that would extract her physically. But the Arcane Eyes that
      Shiki Ryōgi holds grants her power over that formlessness as well. And so,
      Alaya realizes too late. “Now is your blunder obvious, Alaya? It might
      actually have been better for you to trap Shiki in a concrete cell. Matter
      with form takes its toll harder on her when she weaves entropy, and is the
      reason she uses a weapon. Though I doubt even a material prison would have
      kept her for long. But your flimsy cage is not so solid. You treated her
      as you would a mage, but now your oversight is costing you, as she now
      tears it apart tooth and nail slowly but with the ease of shredding meat.
      And soon, you will be witness to her escape!” With her final sentence,
      Tōko finally looks back over her shoulder at Alaya. Before he can
      comprehend what her eyes told him, his consciousness fades and is fished
      back into the body that contains it. As Alaya is pulled back into his
      body, he senses in it the rumblings of an irregularity. There is coldness
      in it that he has never before felt, and his fingertips grow numb from it.
      The sweat on his forehead mocks the chill running through his body, even
      as his insides seem to completely stop, shouting to him of some impending
      peril. It has been severed, he thinks in protestation, unbelieving. But he
      is now face to face with the truth of the matter. For he senses the place,
      somewhere in this building, where something has just torn its way free. It
      is the closed space he’d constructed, now destroyed in a single unwavering
      stroke. Though Alaya’s will controls his body, it also has sympathetic
      correspondence with the almost living properties of the building. The
      framework his flesh; the wiring his nerves; the pipes his veins and
      arteries. And the pain of it being cut reflects and finds its way back to
      roost in its owner, a pain so great that even Alaya cannot ignore it, the
      proof of it lying in the loss of concentration that forced him to close
      his scrying spell on the first floor lobby and return to his body, as if
      compelled by some forceful arm. “What is happening?” he murmurs as he
      wipes the sweat off his brow with an arm. Chills trickle down his spine,
      little spiders crawling up and down with their tiny legs. It is the herald
      of a nauseating emotion that he has not felt in many, many years. “Be
      still, Sōren Alaya,” he scolds to himself for his moment of weakness. But
      the phenomenon he feels doesn’t stop. The arcane power that only moments
      ago he channeled through every fabric of his body seems to grow dim, and
      he cannot bring his fingertips to change the threads of reality’s weaving,
      as mages do. He feels death given form draw closer and closer.
      Unexpectedly, a deep rumbling sound can be heard. It comes from beyond the
      hallway Alaya stands in now, echoing from the lobby. It is the distinct
      and familiar sound of the elevator in operation, bringing something up
      towards the tenth floor. It is not long before the rumbling noise stops,
      and silence returns, only to be broken again by the sound of the elevator
      door opening. Now a soft, dry noise, repeating. Footfalls from shoes
      resounding from the marble floor, their metronomic click growing louder,
      coming closer. Wasting no time, Alaya directs himself back to the lobby.
      And then, though finding it hard to believe, he sees who it is that comes.
      She appears before him, the light of the lobby behind her forcing the
      figure into a silhouette, but it is easy enough to see the white kimono,
      and the accompanying leather jacket that clearly does not match it. It is
      easy enough to see the raven hair, looking wet and unkempt as if its owner
      had just emerged from a long slumber in a lake. And the normally black
      eyes of the void, now burning with an Arcane blue. In one hand she holds
      the hilt of the sword being drawn slowly, lovingly from its scabbard in
      her other hand. Even in the oppressive dark of night, the blade glints.
      Sword drawn, she swings it lazily across her to rest at her side as she
      walks forward, gliding ethereally like a soldier in a bloody battlefield.
      Bringing the tranquility that heralds death in her presence, Shiki Ryōgi
      has returned.
