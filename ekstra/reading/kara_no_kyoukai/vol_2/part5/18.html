    <h1 class="title">Chapter 18</h1>
    <p>
      Shiki stops walking just outside the entrance to the corridor. Sword
      pointed downward at the floor, she sees the black-coated mage Sōren Alaya
      from afar, separated from each other by a distance of about ten meters. “I
      do not understand. How did you destroy my ward, Shiki Ryōgi?” Alaya says,
      his face grimacing in pain. It is the question that he has already
      repeated many times in his mind. And though he suspects knows the answer,
      he still asks it so that the gravity of it becomes more real. The girl
      before him now is the same girl that only last night suffered broken ribs
      and lost her consciousness at his own hands. In the closed space that lay
      between the walls of the building, she awoke, breaking the barriers with
      the arms she used to weave her own variety of sorcery. What is “ ” is
      antonymic to infinity. The concept of infinity is twinned with the concept
      of a finite existence. It is this finite existence, this end of all things
      that Shiki Ryōgi observes with her Arcane Eyes, and the same end that she
      cuts to make entropy act quickly, almost immediately. The prison she was
      contained in was made to be infinite, an inconceivable non-Euclidean
      space. But there is no true infinity. Only ends, driven by processes both
      mechanical and mystical. The only denial of the end that exists is the
      true nothingness of “ ”. To this girl, the space was nothing more than a
      room with its door unbarred and unguarded. It shames Alaya to admit it as
      such. “Someone must have made you aware of it,” he protests. “The injury I
      inflicted was far too severe for it to have healed already. Why does that
      body move? Why did you awake despite your wounds? Why did you not stay in
      slumber for only a precious few minutes more?” Alaya’s voice is rough, the
      only sign he has yet given of any anger he can present. The barrier never
      mattered, he thinks, but had she only kept her peace for a few more
      minutes, all would have been settled. Did she come back to life by
      herself, or did someone assist her? The question rings again and again in
      Alaya’s mind. Did someone wake her, make her aware she was imprisoned, and
      told her the secret to setting herself free? The damnable Art of Tōko
      Aozaki? No, she’d have had no time, having to duel me in the first time,
      and Alba in the second. His face shows him in deep thought, running over
      the possibilities. He looks at the palm of his hand, the same hand that
      wiped Tomoe Enjō off completely only minutes ago. Perhaps the most
      decisive minutes he ever gave. “It was Tomoe Enjō, was it not?” Alaya
      guesses, spitting out the name like a powerful curse. Shiki only shakes
      her head in disagreement. “Nah, Enjō didn’t have a thing to do with waking
      me up. No one did. Woke up by my own self. Enjō didn’t even need to come
      here,” she says quietly. The wind blowing from the open hallway behind
      Alaya makes his greatcoat ruffle, and Shiki’s hair sway. “But to give him
      some credit, he’s the reason you failed.” When Shiki says this, Alaya’s
      dark eyes narrow in curiosity as he ponders on what she said. Assuming
      something would be able to stop him, it would have been Shiki or Tōko
      Aozaki. Not the actor being pulled along on its strings. “Impossible,”
      Alaya declares. “He could not do anything. He played his part well as a
      puppet, to bring you here.” “True, he may have never had any real chance.
      But can you let go on the whole ‘he was always a puppet’ thing? You’re
      like the biggest guy in denial if you just keep saying it.” Alaya cannot
      reply, for he knows it is true. When Tomoe Enjō escaped from the cycle he
      had set, Alaya thought that he could be used. He integrated him into his
      plan, adjusting it to allow for what he would do. But his escape itself
      was never part of the original plan. Wouldn’t that agency go against what
      Alaya had been saying all along? And it had slipped past him, even allowed
      him to affect the plan that he had long drawn up. “You saw that little
      chink in your plan and decided to use it,” Shiki says. “But that one
      little mistake put a lotta holes in it. I mean, he’s the one that brought
      me here, wasn’t he? And guess who’s wrecking your party now? Just him
      escaping was already plenty significant.” She advances one step forward,
      sluggishly, almost drunkenly, and it throws the black-coated mage off
      enough for him to hesitate readying his arm as he usually would. Alaya
      senses something wrong, something different about her. He does not know
      where she learned the knowledge of Tomoe Enjō’s destruction, and can only
      guess. The emotion emanating from her is…hate? A trifling difference,
      Alaya considers. Mere change in her thoughts does not bridge the gap
      between our ability. And yet, Alaya cannot help but see her as an entirely
      different being. Shiki continues her ponderous advance. She doesn’t even
      look like she is ready to fight. She speaks again. “Honestly, I don’t give
      a damn about you. But you gave me a hard time a few days ago, and I’m
      thinking maybe it’s time to pay you back. And so you’ll die here,
      tonight.” Her gaze is sleepy, her eyes less sharp. “But you know what?
      This is the first time that I’m not really excited about killing someone.
      Even though I know this round’s gonna go down to the wire, I can’t even
      laugh.” The sword in Shiki’s hand clicks as her previously lax grip on it
      suddenly changes into a more firm, more secure purchase on the grip.
      Advancing slowly, she maintains her forward gaze as the sword rests beside
      her, hilt at waist level and pointing downwards. This finally makes the
      mage raise his hand, deploying the three circular lines that traditionally
      surround him in a perimeter. “Very well. If this is what you desire,”
      Alaya says as he readies himself. “Killing you will only delay me shortly
      in the grand scheme of things. I should never have hoped to capture you
      alive from the very beginning. I will find a way to revive you, and
      transfer my soul. Though this body may expire, it is a small price to pay
      to reach the spiral of origin.” Shiki doesn’t answer, but instead stops
      her advance when she sees the circular perimeter. The distance between
      them has closed somewhat. The outermost circle in Alaya’s threefold
      perimeter extends a four meter radius from him. Shiki stops two meters
      beyond the perimeter. Briefly, the mage can sense Shiki’s thirst for blood
      shift from winter cold to summer heat, feels it wrap around the corridor
      and make his hair stand on end. But even sensing this intimidating change
      in her, even knowing the age, quality, and pedigree of the sword she holds
      in her hand, he is confident in Shiki’s defeat. Her swordplay will not
      avail her today. But Shiki senses something different. If the mage no
      longer thought that letting her live would be an option, he would not have
      allowed Shiki to close the distance the way she did. No, he would have
      killed her from afar outright. Alaya still holds out hope that he can
      still take her alive, and it is that little detail, Shiki thinks, that
      gives her the advantage. Halted just outside the wards that Alaya
      deployed, Shiki readies herself. Her second hand grips the hilt of the
      sword. Her back lowers slightly, and her center of mass along with it,
      arching herself in a stance ready to spring. All traces of the languor
      that possessed her previously is now well and truly gone. She brings the
      sword front and center, pointing it angled with the tip leveled at her
      enemy’s throat. The most basic stance of any discipline of swordplay.
      Facing the mage, she closes her eyes and nods in understanding. “Now I
      know,” she says softly. “I don’t really want to kill you. It’s just that I
      can’t stand the thought of you existing.” Her last thoughts for Tomoe’s
      killer. The scent of murder is high in the air, and both Alaya and Shiki
      smell it, letting it pass over their entirety in one sweet instant. In the
      next, the invisible signal for battle is given, and the duel begins. A
      flash, then Shiki’s eyes open. Alaya channels his mana into his
      outstretched hand, his motivating force in this fight not the confidence
      which infused him in previous conflicts, but instead the rare, almost
      foreign emotion that gripped him since he saw Shiki walking the lobby: the
      emotion of dread. Which is why he feels he must kill her here, now.
      “SHUKU!” he roars angrily, clenching his hand into a fist, defining a
      space around Shiki that he would crush. The lag between the lorica and the
      weaving of the spell is so small as to be nonexistent, and one casting of
      it should be enough to dispose of the girl. But Shiki is fast,
      anticipating his spell. In a flash the sword is raised high above her
      head, the speed blindingly fast. With the swiftness with which she raised
      her sword, she lets it fly downward in a vicious slash. The spell
      manifests only for a moment, but Shiki kills it, just as surely as the
      ringing sound of her blade cutting air seems to cancel out Alaya’s booming
      voice. The mage attempts to repeat the spell. He need only open his palm
      again, and then close it. But it is too slow for him to react properly. He
      hasn’t even spoken, hasn’t even entered the spell’s weaving in his mind,
      when Shiki displaces from her position. She shifts the sword to her side
      at waist level—a side stance that allows for wide swings—and sprints to
      her target. Before the fight, Alaya considered the loss of one ward to be
      acceptable, thinking to take Shiki with the second. But now her blinding
      advance eliminates two of the wards in quick succession; two steps forward
      and two slashes swung gracefully from both flanks. And still she advances.
      She has just closed the previously six meter gap into zero. One more step,
      one more breath, timed with one more strike to end the game. The sword
      comes from Alaya’s right flank, and he sees the blade flow in a diagonal
      cut. Her speed almost seems to make time flow in discrete events rather
      than arbitrary measurements of seconds. The attack is similar to her
      previous two blows, and its telegraphed nature allows Alaya to dodge it by
      jumping back deeper into the hallway, widening the distance between the
      two. A brief pause as the mage studies his opponent with a glance. From
      Shiki’s lips, a single, straight line of fresh blood runs from mouth to
      chin. But Alaya knows she has taken no blow yet. Then it must be
      yesterday’s wound. The broken ribs, the internal organ damage. Still in
      their fragile healing state, they must have been reopened, and even
      walking forces blood from her throat. She is clearly injured, and yet she
      dances with such single-mindedness. Alaya lets the right arm rest at his
      side. That is, until he realizes there is no more arm. From the top of his
      shoulder all the way to his right chest, the clear traces of a clean
      strike can be seen, and on the floor lies his missing arm. His
      manipulation of space made the backstep he performed faster than any
      normal human, yet Shiki was still able to cut him with a strike so perfect
      that even the owner of the arm never noticed it until after the fact.
      “What manner of creature—” Alaya leaves the question unfinished. Unmindful
      of the injury, he focuses on his enemy. The strike could have been fatal.
      If his third ward had not been present, the slash would have dealt him a
      blow that would no doubt cut him in two. But it had instead slowed down
      Shiki’s strike enough to save him. But Alaya is instead simultaneously
      fascinated by Shiki’s complete difference from the night of their first
      duel. Is it anger from what he did to Enjō? No, surely not. He narrows his
      gaze at the girl in the white kimono. Suddenly, she straightens herself
      and recovers a hand from the grip of the sword, releasing her tensed
      stance, suddenly turning back into the girl of last night. The recovered
      hand cups her mouth, and she coughs twice. The hand drips regurgitated
      blood. If she did not have to fight such severe wounds, Alaya ponders, she
      would give me no respite. “You change with the weapon you hold,” the
      black-coated mage observes in astonishment. It is the reason she seems so
      different. Her extensive training in the dance of the sword changes her,
      forcing her into an almost trance-like state. Her mind compartmentalizes
      much like, as Alaya suspects, the past warriors did by training their mind
      to shape their bodies as a weapon. The fight was killing and survival,
      outside it was normalcy. “Hmph. A form of autohypnosis, as mages do when
      working the Art,” he mutters, his voice struggling to hold back the pain
      from his right arm. Shiki shrugs. “Whatever you wanna call it, I guess.”
      Alaya curses his own dismissal of her sudden shift in demeanor. When she
      opened her eyes; that’s when it must have occurred. To think the Ryōgi
      dynasty would still teach such vulgar disciplines. He knew too that Shiki
      bridging the space between them in what almost seemed like one step was no
      coincidence. Her movement, the sway of her sword, her attention, all
      focused and refined to make her a deadly living weapon, and she was the
      only one who knew about it. He had thought her tools to be only the Arcane
      Eyes of Death Perception and her knife, but in truth, her skill with the
      sword is far greater. “You have fooled me, Shiki Ryōgi. I had thought you
      had revealed all you could about your skill in combat when you danced with
      Fujino Asagami. But I see you have this one last trick.” Shiki shakes her
      head slowly in reply. Whether it is an affirmative or a disparaging
      negative, Alaya can’t say. “And so we meet properly at last,” he shouts as
      he pressed down on the gaping wound of his former right arm. The girl in
      the white kimono reveals a smile, the first truly gentle smile she has
      performed; a smile that signals the end. Returning to her original hard
      posture, she runs toward Alaya like a loosed arrow. He knows that Shiki
      can read him now, knows what to expect, and so he won’t be able to dodge
      this next strike. But he won’t allow her to press the advantage so easily,
      not here in his sanctum. He gambles his chances on meeting Shiki’s
      advance. He steps forward, and shouts. “DakatsU!” In time with this, Alaya
      raises his left arm in an attempt to block Shiki’s attack. He hopes that
      the sarira—the sacred remains of devout masters—embedded within, will ward
      away most of the damage the slash will inflict. Even she will not easily
      be able to see the lines of entropy. Shiki’s sword impacts his arm, and in
      an instant, Alaya can see that the blow has been checked. As soon as he
      realizes this, he wastes no time in his next move. He animates his severed
      arm with an improvised working of the Art, making the arm move toward
      Shiki with unnatural speed. It slithers along the floor until, when it
      nears Shiki, it springs up and grabs her by the throat, pressing hard and
      choking her. Shiki drops her guard at the move she couldn’t anticipate,
      and Alaya presses the advantage he has momentarily gained. He retreats one
      step to pull back the left arm that warded off Shiki’s previous attack,
      and extends it again with open palm right in front of Shiki. “Shuku!” He
      clenches his fist, and tightens space yet again. Shiki feels her body
      crumpling with a compelling force seeming to come from all places at once,
      and an audible grunt of pain finally escapes her lips. The leather jacket
      is torn away, and she is forced away from where she stood, Alaya having
      manipulated the space to compress to a size far smaller than it appeared
      to be. At first, Shiki actually looks like she will fall hard to the floor
      from the attack, but she catches her footing just in time. Quickly, she
      redoubles her attack, the corridor funneling her into a singular path
      directly toward Alaya again and again. For a moment, she seems to
      disappear from Alaya’s sight, but she has only bent low and run fast
      toward him, getting under his guard more quickly than he can react. The
      sword moves in a blur, and it instantly strikes Alaya right in his center
      of mass. The mage can feel his accumulated life ebbing away for only a
      fleeting instant. “Fool!” shouts Alaya as he attempts to deliver a kick
      towards Shiki’s midsection to ward her away. It’s an move easy to see, and
      so Shiki handily dodges it by jumping widely to the side, but the blade
      slides out of its shallow cut as she moves. Alaya now understands. If I
      want to stop her, the structure will have to go with it! The mage opens
      his left hand to crush space for the third time. Having gained some
      distance from the jump, Shiki easily sees the spell coming. A quick but
      violent slash prevents it from manifesting any further around her. But
      after the slash, she stands stock still. Alaya has completely vanished,
      black greatcoat and all. Nothing I can do about whatever magic he uses to
      move around, thinks Shiki. If he wants to run, I’ll let him run. She runs
      to the edge of the hallway, with the view of the outside, and puts a hand
      on the railing as she casts her eyes below to find her target. But he’s
      not gonna get away this time. Without hesitation, Shiki leaps over the
      edge. Away from Shiki, Alaya begins to crush the building itself. It might
      damage Shiki’s body, the same body he planned on using, but as long as he
      can still restore it to some semblance of a human function, then let its
      shape be damned. Even if the skull is shattered and the gray matter
      scattered, it can be replaced. What matters to him is that the body not
      expire completely until he works upon it, so that he can tap the soul
      connected to the spiral of origin. The loss of his arm and the stab on his
      chest are nothing compared to the ultimate goal, the ars magna to which he
      has struggled toward these many years. As long as he reaches the spiral of
      origin, where everything begins and ends, all is well. What he must do
      remains the same, only delayed now. This seems to be the only option now
      to prevent a stalemate between us, Alaya thinks. Had I only killed her
      outright, it would not have come to this. Still, it has come, and I must
      close this chapter of her life. Weaving the Art and relocating him through
      space, Alaya has placed himself in the garden outside the building, which
      as far as he is concerned, feels like stepping out of his own body. He
      sees the greenery that surrounds the building often, but it has been so
      long since he has set foot in it. Though a part of the grounds, the
      dominating will of his subjective reality that strengthened him so much
      inside has little effect here. After he emerges from his relocation, he
      wastes no time. He looks up and extends his remaining arm skyward to point
      to the very top of the cylindrical structure, opening his palm. The next
      thing he knows, a vicious cut goes straight down and through his left
      shoulder. The next thing he knew, a vicious cut went straight down and
      through his left shoulder. “Shiki…Ryōgi,” he manages to gurgle out with
      difficulty as he looks up at the night sky. “You damned…fool of a woman.”
      He coughs, and blood emerges red and blooming from his mouth. Not given a
      chance to land on either himself or Shiki, the droplets of blood are
      carried away on the wind only a few feet away, but now a distance he can
      no longer traverse. “All this…impossible.” Alaya had emerged in the
      grounds outside the building, looked up at the structure to work his
      spell, only to meet the fleeting sight of Shiki Ryōgi falling rapidly from
      the tenth floor. Which means there was little interval between the mage’s
      weaving of his relocation spell, and the girl’s thoughtless descent from
      the highest floor of the building. What confidence possessed her at that
      moment, he will never know. He suspects he would never be able to know.
      How could Shiki have known that he would appear in the grounds outside?
      And even given this, who would even think to jump off and think they would
      land safely? To aim and hit a lone man from that height at that nearly
      uncontrolled fall is an act that has gone well past recklessness and into
      the realm of some miraculous foresight. As if she’d known. And yet she did
      it. Without Alaya not having even completed the spell, having not even
      manifested in the garden yet, she jumped and did it. And at almost the
      exact same time as he appeared, he was struck by Shiki’s blow. The arm
      that he had extended upward very quickly became an improvised shield, but
      it was not enough to stop the slash from landing in his left shoulder,
      reaching all the way to his abdomen. Even the arcane shield that the
      sarira in his arm had afforded him was not enough to stop the sheer force
      of it. As for Shiki, she is unconscious and still, standing but leaning on
      the blade inside Alaya’s body. Ironically, for all the defenses Alaya put
      up—his arm, the protection of the sarira, and the last ward that he had
      managed to erect at the last moment—Shiki broke through all of them and
      they served only to cushion her fall. Without them, the fall would have
      been fatal at worst, or aggravated her internal damage and killed her
      eventually at best. Another miracle. Her grip on the sword is tight as
      rigor mortis. Alaya’s brow clouds his already anguished face as he looks
      upon the unconscious Shiki. “You were prepared to risk it all on one
      gamble to kill me. No, if not through this, than through another way,
      surely. You could kill me. Perhaps it was no risk at all. It is a poor
      sight to see Sōren Alaya defeated by a neophyte such as you.” His words
      this time finally ring without his previous posturing. Alaya’s left arm is
      virtually severed, and the right is long gone. The mage, still standing,
      kicks the unconscious Shiki away, striking her chest. Her body flies away
      from him and a few feet deeper into the grounds. But Shiki continues to
      cling tightly to the sword hilt, even as it is still embedded in the
      mage’s body. So the blade, having also been weakened by the impact of the
      fall, is now forced into two: one half remaining embedded in Alaya’s body,
      and the other half in Shiki’s possession. And with that, the four hundred
      years of its history come to an end. Shiki, now collapsed on the garden
      soil, remains unmoving. Looking at her with displeasure, he mutters. “You
      lie there finally wearing the look of a girl your age.” The mage, too, is
      unmoving as his face grows dark. The last bit of his energy has been
      expended in kicking Shiki away, and now he can’t do anything. For he feels
      that the slash has struck more than just the body: one of his lines of
      death must have been cut. “Through that appearance, I know we will never
      do battle again.” The mage dispels the ward that is already fading fast,
      and whispers to himself in a sort of prayer. “My origin is known to me. It
      is quiescence. Those whose origin is awakened returns soon to the spiral.”
