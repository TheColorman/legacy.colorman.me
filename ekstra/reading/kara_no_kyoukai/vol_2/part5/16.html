      “Spare us the hackneyed lines of ‘but you should be dead,’ Cornelius.
      You’re a mage. You know all about bodies. About containers. About the
      creation of life and the granting of sentience. Don’t disappoint me,” Tōko
      Aozaki says with a bitter tenderness. Alba is silent and has his eyes
      affixed only on her. On his hands can be seen a faint trembling. Tōko
      drops her bag on the marble floor with an accompanying “That should do
      it.” The bag is the only thing that proves to be different. Her face, her
      eyes, her hair, the smug smile she wears; all the same. Only the bag has
      changed. Yesterday it was just a smallish briefcase, but this one is far
      bigger. One you’d take on a trip, and where you could conceivably hide a
      small child in. “I came as fast I could,” Tōko says, “but from the looks
      of things, I guess I didn’t make it in time. I believe I made it clear
      that Kokutō isn’t my apprentice, but you just wouldn’t listen. Never
      taught him a thing about the Art. And in case you’re wondering, nope, I
      haven’t changed one iota.” “But—but you should be dead! I snuffed the life
      out of you with my bare hands!” Alba shouts, seemingly oblivious to what
      Tōko is saying. He curls his hands into fists to stop himself from
      trembling. In his mind he is equal parts unbelieving, mad, and fearful,
      though he tries his best to hide it. Tōko is placid and continues to
      refuse meeting Alba’s bloodshot stare, choosing instead to retrieve a pack
      of cigarettes from her pocket. Alba watches her every move from where he
      is. The more the figure before him continues to act like the Tōko he
      knows, the chill in his spine grows ever worse. Unable to contain himself,
      he cries out to Tōko. “You can’t be here. It’s a mistake. Yes! Some sort
      of mistake! You’re lost on the way to your next life. The dead should not
      linger in this world. Begone, spectre!” He raises a blood-soaked hand, the
      same hand that Mikiya stabbed. His blood and the blood of Tōko’s
      pulverized head are coming together in a mix of red for red. He swings
      this hand in a wide arc in front of him, splattering wet blood all around.
      As the scattered liquid flies through the air, they combust and burst into
      sizeable flames in flight like gasoline. All of his remaining malice, he
      hurls toward Tōko in that desperate weaving of the Art. The flames whip in
      arcs and try to wrap around Tōko, but in an instant, she moves her own
      hand, as if to pull the flames in. Sure enough, the fire is drawn to her
      hand, where it comes to a halt right before it. Palm open and the
      concentrted flame hovering above it, Tōko uses it to light the cigarette
      in her mouth, and by waving it away with a casual disdain, the flames are
      dispelled. “Hey, Cornelius, if you don’t want dead men and women in this
      building then I suggest you file a complaint with this apartment’s owner.
      Knock the act off already, can’t you tell I’m the real deal? Pretty big
      difference between the dead and the living. Like cigarettes.” She takes in
      a satisfied puff, and frowns. “For example, I can tell that this one’s
      some bad stuff,” Tōko chuckles. The casualness with which he throws away
      her comments finally makes Alba realize that the person before him is
      indeed a living thing, unchanged from the original. But that only makes
      him repeat the same question, not in disbelief, but due to being unable to
      understand. So he repeats. “But you should be dead,” he says, a note of
      dejection in his voice. The words force a frown on Tōko’s face, leaving
      unsaid her displeasure in the trite line, allowing her amber eyes to make
      her point. “Technically, Cornelius, I did die. Body virtually destroyed,
      soul severed from the flesh, the whole shebang.” “Then explain your being
      here!” She sighs. “I thought that would have been obvious. I’m the
      replacement, fresh out of the package,” she says, no absurdity finding its
      way into her voice. The statement leaves the red-coated mage blank, mouth
      half open. “What do you mean a ‘replacement?’ Are you a puppet when you
      can be revived so easily? Or maybe—” Alba starts to think of other
      possibilities, other well-kept lore and arcana of the Art. The puppets
      that mages create can never match with the human façade. It can move as a
      man would, but it will expose itself soon enough, through speech, or
      action, or appearance; something that seems off or wrong in its creation,
      something that exposes its true nature. That, and the parts that make it
      tick are not truly alive, only clever mechanisms animated by the Art. A
      loss of limb—exposing blood and muscle sinew—will reveal it. The Art
      cannot create an automaton that contains the spark of humanity. An old
      mage saying from the Middle Ages, passed down to become common knowledge.
      Eventually it became almost a rule. Yet despite this, the woman standing
      in front of Alba is certainly human. Certainly some kind of replica, but
      completely lacking the distinctive tell that gives away the fakery of all
      puppets. Which, to Alba, can only mean that this woman is the real Tōko
      Aozaki. “Now I see it! Then the one I killed is surely the fake!” “Just
      keep lying to yourself, Cornelius. That also means that the mage that
      bested you yesterday was nothing more than a pale imitation of me,
      correct?” “Hmph. Fine, then that was the real thing. But here we have a
      paradox. You’re saying both are real. How do you explain this
      inconsistency away?!” Alba cries out to Tōko. But from the look on his
      face after he says it, it seems he solved the answer by himself. He shakes
      his head rapidly, still doubting, still thinking it impossible. But how
      else can he explain it? Can it be possible? “Aozaki, don’t tell me
      you’re—” “Ding ding. Both the one you fought yesterday, and the me
      standing before you today, are fakes. I don’t even know the point that the
      real became the fake. I don’t even know if it matters anymore.” The mage
      in the orange trench coat dons a cruel grin. “Then what are you? Not an
      original? Was there even an original? But you call yourself Tōko Aozaki,
      don’t you? With a soul to work the Art, and granted sentience! But all the
      puppets granted fleeting sentience up to this point have been unable to
      grasp the existential dilemma of their artificial nature, and end up
      terminating themselves. How do you break the rules? How do you continue to
      function?!” “Everything before me was but second rate sentience, I’d say.
      I really don’t see the need for how scared you are right now, Cornelius.
      You call me fake, yet there’s only one Tōko Aozaki. As a parting gift,
      I’ll even tell you how that came to be. Maybe it’ll be a good learning
      experience.” Losing a bit of her calm façade, she finally meets Alba’s eye
      to eye. “Listen, Cornelius. The me you’re seeing right now is something I
      kept in my sanctum. It activated itself once you killed Tōko Aozaki. Only
      been an hour since. I am a mage that traffics in pawns and puppets, so I
      experiment on them as well. In one of these experiments, I crafted my
      foremost creation: a perfect puppet imitation of me. No more, and no less
      than myself. I looked on it, and allowed my thoughts to wander. I thought
      that having created such a thing, maybe there is no longer any need for
      me.” As the puppeteer relates the story to her like a layperson to a
      priest, Alba gulps. He can’t believe his ears. Heresy to the laws of the
      Ordo Magi, pure and simple. Why would she not be happy that she achieved
      this, instead of throwing away her existence? “Ridiculous,” Alba spits
      out. “In the end, what you created couldn’t be anything more than an
      automaton. Assuming you could even make such a thing as you described in
      the first place. And if you have indeed performed it, then why does it
      not…why do you not seek ascension? Why do you not aim higher? Mages are
      never satisfied by the status quo. We seek, manipulate, create, and
      destroy only for the final step in that ladder.” “Hey, you’re looking at
      the state of the art of the Art here, and even when I was gone, it still
      went on doing the same thing I did. How does that give any puppeteer hope
      for ascension?” “But it’s all just supposed to be theory! I wouldn’t allow
      myself to be cast aside for something new, yet similar to me. Even if it
      was an achievement that would make my name ring throughout the history of
      the Art, it is not enough. I must be there to observe it, or else there is
      no meaning!” Alba screams incoherently as he wraps his arms around himself
      as if it would protect him from something he didn’t quite yet know. Anyone
      can discern the difference now between the two mages; between the one who
      preoccupied himself on the matters of revenge, and the mage that threw
      herself away for the path of gnosis. But Alba refuses to acknowledge it.
      “Call it a difference of opinion and philosophy, Alba. Still, no need to
      blame yourself. To tell you the truth, I’m sort of jealous of you,
      actually. I don’t know when I became the way I am. I don’t even know which
      of me was real anymore. I just woke up when the previous me died. The soul
      remembers everything, and it’s all there in my head, everything I know.
      Determinism and entropy kinda says that I take the same action as my
      predecessor would. After all this, maybe I’ll make another puppet to
      convince myself that I’m the real thing. The real thing might be the one
      you killed. It might already be dead. But it’s all the same thing, isn’t
      it? No way to distinguish us. It’s a quantum superposition like that cat
      in the box problem. No one’s ever gonna know. But I think what’s important
      right now for you and me is the fact that I’m here, and that for now, for
      all intents and purposes, I’m Tōko Aozaki, and if it brings you any
      measure of comfort, you can think of the one you killed as the fake. We
      clear? Good! Now we can get down to real business.” She reaches down for
      the bag she’d placed on the floor. Alba stares at her opponent, more
      terrified of her revelation than if she had woven a dozen curses at him.
      “That’s right,” he says in a low voice. “That’s why Alaya kept you alive.
      As long as you remained alive, the next iteration of you wouldn’t trigger
      and come alive.” Tōko keeps her silence now, only maintaining her harsh
      glance at the red-coated mage. Alba had long since stopped trying to hold
      back his trembling. For him, the cold grows stronger as he looks into
      Tōko’s sterile eyes. He sees no warmth in that amber color, only an
      efficient intent to kill buried inside them. He never knew Tōko to look
      like the way she did now. Not even in their time in the Collegium did she
      show anything as bloodthirsty as she is at this moment. And Alba comes to
      the idea that, for him, the Tōko he had known until now was the only real
      one. Not this cold, standing figure that hides so many secrets even from
      herself. No, not this side of her that is the ruthless mage that is peer
      to none. And as he entertains such thoughts, he finds what reason for
      revenge he holds start to become less significant, less pressing. For he
      didn’t know what monster he had aligned himself against, or if he really
      hated it. Because, at the very least, the Tōko Aozaki he knew was very
      much different. “Are you real?” he whispers one last time like a
      confession. Tōko snickers. “Now what meaning does that question have on
      something like me?” she hisses, her face a portrait of sweetly ringing
      malice. Tōko brings the cigarette held between her fingers back to her
      mouth. “Now, let’s return to our more pressing problems,” she says as she
      puffs out gray smoke from her mouth. “You hurt my friend pretty badly with
      your teasing. Probably didn’t even notice the hour go by.” Alba, for his
      part, does indeed remember Tōko saying that it took her an hour to get
      here. He looks at the boy collapsed at the foot of the stairs. The wounds
      in his knees remain unchanged. But mysteriously, the wounds in his head
      and the blood that those wounds are supposed to have spawned are gone.
      “What—what manner of sorcery have you done, Aozaki?” Alba asks feebly. All
      the bluster of his earlier displays have left him, and whatever will he
      had left to attack Tōko is gone in the face of her greater proficiency.
      “Tsk tsk. We mages shouldn’t use that word so lightly. Remember: this is
      the third time I’ve been in this lobby. The first time I was here, I
      placed my own spell. On a delayed trigger, if you will. A little trick I
      placed in advance that I could play in tonight’s party. Think back to the
      time of your surprise when our boy Kokutō here lunged at you with the
      knife.” “That was the trick?” Alba moans in regret, remembering that exact
      time. There is a void in his memory, something missing that connects what
      happened before and after the boy’s attack on him. A momentary lapse? Some
      illusion the puppet master had set up beforehand that manipulated his
      perception? He laughs in futility. “So I was playing right into your hands
      from the very start, you witch. You must have enjoyed yourself immensely,
      Aozaki. Though I am loathe to admit it, I must have seemed quite the
      fool.” “Oh, don’t blame yourself overmuch. After all, I never thought I’d
      end up dying. Rest easy, though. I didn’t come here again to pay back that
      particular act, but for something else. That you and Kokutō happened to be
      here is a mere convenience.” Tōko gives a slight nudge to the bag placed
      beside her feet and makes it fall to the ground. Or roll over, more like.
      Its shape is approximately that of a cube, and its size intimidatingly
      large. “If you are not here for revenge, then what is your purpose?” Alba
      asks. “To stop Alaya’s mad attempts at experimenting with the Art, no
      doubt.” “Not by a long shot. Why should I when that thing takes care of
      itself? No, Alba. My business is with you alone.” As though he’d arrived
      at the same conclusion, Alba nods. But, he wonders, why him if Tōko says
      she bears him no ill will, or any intent to interfere in Alaya’s
      experiments? Why does she look so tensed and prepared on spilling blood?
      “Why? I’ve done nothing else to you,” he says in protest. “Nothing much
      more than a trifle. I mean, I’ve pretty much gotten over your irrational
      hatred of me. To tell you the truth, I rather preferred it that way ever
      since our time in the Collegium together. It was proof that I was always
      better.” “Then why?!” “Still don’t remember? It’s a very simple reason:
      you called me by a moniker far too old to be funny.” The sound of Tōko’s
      suitcase opening rings out in the lobby, and within it Alba can only see a
      dark mass which somehow remains untouched by all the light. And within
      that there are two things— “Come now, recall those words in the
      Collegium,” Tōko declares. “Recall the name “Wild Red.” Recall how I swore
      to destroy anyone who said it. And how I did.” —two lights— or two eyes.
      And upon seeing it, Alba finally understands. He chastises himself
      belatedly for not realizing it sooner. This is a box for sealing magical
      familiars inside, similar to what Tōko used before, only larger. And the
      creature in it now, whatever it is, emerges from the seemingly infinite
      depths of the box with baffling speed to capture Cornelius Alba with
      thorn-lined tendrils. He feels a thousand tiny mouths chewing and
      consuming him in small portions as he is dragged into the box, being eaten
      alive. When only his head and neck remain visible, Alba and the
      puppetmaster’s eyes meet for the last time before he is completely
      consumed. Her eyes are eyes of laughter. And he finally realizes his
      foolishness in ever thinking that he could rival such a monster. He
      remembers Alaya’s last words to him. Perhaps he should have seen this
      coming after all. The last thoughts in the mind of a mage slowly being
      eaten.
