    <p>
      Waiting until the time he and Enjō agreed upon, Mikiya Kokutō finally sets
      foot for the second time on the building’s grounds. The path that runs
      through the garden seems to be deserted. The grass in the garden
      surrounding the path is as rightly emerald green as grass should be, but
      strangely lacking its distinctive smell. He passes through it and into the
      lobby, bright with its electric lighting. Not a sound can be heard. The
      fluorescent lights make no reflection off of the immaculate surfaces of
      the singularly cream colored walls and floor, yet the entire place leaves
      no corner or nook left unlighted. When Mikiya last came here, it was still
      morning, and he had felt a sort of tepid disquiet. But this night visit is
      different. It’s almost as if the building is pregnant with a suffocating
      stillness. Every step he takes produces an echo: minute, almost unheard,
      only for the sound to vanish into oblivion less than a second later. Now,
      the silence is chilling, oppressive, and close to being physically thick,
      making Mikiya’s every step heavy. Like the building recognizes his foreign
      nature and works to expel him. Still, he is decided, and can’t back down
      now, not when there are people counting on him. Forcing his way through
      the thickness of the air, he proceeds through the lobby. “Guess I should
      start with the third floor,” he mutters. He decides not to use the stairs,
      as using the elevator would probably attract more attention, leaving Enjō
      to do the work he needed. So he pushes the up button beside the elevator
      door, and hears the low howling of the machine’s activation. The lights
      above the door indicate that it’s descending from the fifth floor. Before
      long, the door starts to open silently, quite a contrast to its noise just
      moments before. But even as the elevator door is starting to open, Mikiya
      already sees someone inside it. Without really knowing yet who it is, he
      gulps and takes a step back. “Ah, so you’ve come. What perfect timing,
      too. I was just thinking of paying a visit to your master’s sanctum,” says
      the man in the blood red coat as a smile slowly spreads across his face.
      He steps out of the elevator with teetering steps, and holds something in
      one hand. His attention is solely affixed on it, facing it with an
      expression halfway between dread and joy. Mikiya looks at it, only to find
      a disgusting lump rising up in his throat. But he can’t look away from it.
      “It is so perfect, is it not?” the man asks mockingly. “I think it has
      utterly captured my heart.” Now he laughs in apparent enjoyment as he
      flaunts the object he is holding. And still Mikiya can’t look away from
      it. For the object the red coated man is holding in one hand is the head
      of Tōko Aozaki. Tōko’s head is remarkably well preserved for the state
      it’s in. The flesh still holds some sort of living warmth, and it looks
      unchanged from when it was still alive. They eyes closed in seeming
      slumber, and the untainted face look straight out of a painting, like
      she’s returned to some purer state of being. Except of course for the fact
      that she’s lost everything from the neck down. With a hand pressed over
      his mouth, Mikiya tries to fight a losing battle against his urge to
      vomit, but it’s not going all too well. “How admirable of you to have come
      to take revenge for your mentor. Aozaki must have inspired great loyalty
      in such a lowly apprentice for you to trouble yourself so. To be honest,
      it makes me jealous.” The smile in Alba’s face seems warped and distorted,
      as though it was a smile carried too far in the service of showmanship.
      “Obviously, your mentor has passed from us. But not completely. Oh no. She
      yet has ears to hear, nerves to feel, and a mind with which to understand.
      It is a mercy, to be sure. I did many things in the service of destroying
      this woman, and I intend to express my gratitude to her. No, I will have
      her cling to life for a while more, at least.” He draws closer to Mikiya,
      each step a shuffle and a stomp, drunk in his own triumph. “Why, you might
      ask?” he hisses. “Because after years of defeat from this woman, it feels
      refreshing to finally become her better. Just killing her outright would
      be an insult to all the time leading up to this moment, an act better than
      she deserves. She will have to feel pain. Oh, don’t worry yourself,
      friend. She’s lost her entire body. She’s got much more serious problems
      to deal with than a little pain, I’m sure.” Alba then lays the fingers of
      his other hand in Tōko’s face in a gentle caress. Then he takes two
      fingers and, with a sudden thrust, inserts them forcefully into both eye
      sockets, forcing fresh blood out as he draws out the familiar eyeballs
      from their now open cavities. The cheeks of Tōko’s face are bathed in
      streams of red tears. Separated from their owner and soaked in her own
      blood, the eyeballs look different and alien to Mikiya now. Only two
      globular pieces of meat. Alba holds out the hand holding the eyeballs
      toward Mikiya, gesturing for him take it. “You see?!” the red-coated man
      says in a half-crazed shout. “That must have hurt, but she didn’t even
      make a sound! But worry not, for she still feels pain as surely as we do.
      Her mind tells her so. Aozaki was always a stubborn one, but I wonder how
      she feels about her eyes being gouged out? Does it hurt, Aozaki? Enough to
      make you cry blood, evidently.” He turns his attention away from the head
      and back to Mikiya. “You! What do you think? You’re her apprentice so you
      must understand how she feels. Well? Can you?!” Mikiya doesn’t answer him.
      The scene is enough to numb him to inaction, let alone think anything
      except how to process the spectacle before him and how to survive this
      encounter. Alba looks on, affirming his satisfied look with a chuckle. “In
      truth, however, I would have wanted to make her suffer not just pain, but
      the humiliation of being reduced to her current state. No matter. I can do
      something better anyway, but I need you.” He looks back at Mikiya again.
      “I wonder, how would you feel if something you’d built, cherished, and
      cared for is destroyed right before your very eyes, as you sit there,
      helpless and unable to even scream. If it were me, I certainly wouldn’t be
      able to take it. Not even killing the person who did it would be enough,
      oh no. Do you see it now, Aozaki?” He turns back to Tōko’s head. “I want
      you, who has only given me indifference, to feel enough hatred to want to
      kill me. The best revenge I could hope for. Though Alaya has robbed me of
      the role of plunging my arms deep into your breast and pulling out your
      heart, this opportunity is still more than I deserve!” As he continues to
      talk to the severed head, he suddenly grabs it with both of his hands, and
      returns his attention to Mikiya. “The moment I discovered Aozaki had an
      apprentice, I was so happy I couldn’t contain myself. I’ve had my eye on
      you since we met. Curse not me but your mentor for making you known to me.
      Ah, but worry not. You will not join her just yet in hell. Though I said
      this head yet lives, we have reached the point where we must first make a
      small adjustment—” He grins as wide as he can muster. Then, with a great
      force, he takes the severed head in between his two hands and squeezes it
      as a vise would. In only a few moments, the thing that was Tōko Aozaki
      compresses, blood pouring out of fissures in the skin from Alba’s strong
      grip, until finally it is shattered into an unrecognizable pile of meat
      and blood that falls to the ground. “—Tada! And now she’s dead! It’s
      magic!” And then the red-coated man laughs with a vigor that fills the
      once silent lobby. Without a word, Mikiya books it, the sickening display
      repeating itself in his mind and burning away any sense or reason he still
      clung to. Not thinking where to go, he directed himself to the east
      building’s lobby. His mind can’t bring up the memory of the last time he
      went there, or the details of the room. It is, in fact, a supreme effort
      for him to just keep from screaming. “It’s time to end this show, I
      think!” Alba calls after him. “Don’t worry! You will follow soon enough!”
      His laughter fades, and he starts to follow after Mikiya at a leisurely
      pace, the hands swinging at his sides dripping with fresh blood and scraps
      of meat. The sewer twists and turns, mazelike in its complexity. With no
      light in place to guide him, and only the steady flow of the sewage to
      return his mind to the passage of time, Tomoe wanders the dank passages.
      Luckily, Mikiya gave Tomoe everything he needed, including a map of the
      sewer infrastructure and a flashlight. Eventually, through these, he
      manages to reach the place where he’s supposed to be in. Above him now
      lies the manhole he needs. He turns off the flashlight and sets the duffel
      bag down leaning on the wall, careful not to let it be carried away by the
      stream of sewage. He fishes around for a crowbar from the bag, and then
      climbs the ladder steps embedded into the sewer wall, going up a height he
      can’t determine. Tomoe’s head hits something metallic, which is all the
      sign he needs. He feels around with one hand for the gap he needs to slide
      the crowbar into, then inserts the hook end into it carefully. Finding
      purchase, he pushes to open the gap wider. Then, with what strength he can
      muster, he pushes with his shoulder until the cover finally gives way,
      flipping across the floor with a hard metallic gong. He sticks his head
      out of the whole to find the entire parking lot similarly dark Satisfied,
      Tomoe goes back down to retrieve the bag, then climbs back up and tosses
      it up first. Next comes Shiki’s sword, then finally himself. Without a
      light to guide his bearing, he pauses for a moment to listen to his
      surroundings. A strange feeling steals its way into him: that of being
      there no threat to actually discover him even as he sneaks around. The
      feeling of complacency. Though with the vastness of the parking lot,
      coupled with the darkness, Tomoe should have every reason to be
      comfortable in that feeling. From somewhere nearby, he hears the sharp
      hissing of steam echoing through the vast emptiness. “The sound…of steam?”
      he whispers to himself as recalls something vague in his mind he thought
      he’d cast away. This particular darkness and the smell in the air are both
      known to Tomoe. Worse, they are familiar, tinged with the feeling of
      stepping over the threshold of one’s house. His bones ache as if in
      response to that familiarity, and the sound of their trembling is worsened
      by his mind, replaying them over and over again. He studies his perimeter
      yet again, and this time finds a beacon glow in the distance, a warm
      orange light that calls to him. When Tomoe sees it, he suddenly feels hot,
      as if his mind just caught up to the real temperature of the room. His
      feet draw him closer to the orange light in the center of everything, and
      he starts to hear the faint sound of the hissing noise he’d heard before.
      As Tomoe edges deeper into the room, his eyes start to adjust to the
      darkness. Along the walls to his side are large canisters, arranged in an
      order he can’t yet discern. The floor is littered with long, narrow tubes
      that lead to somewhere undetermined. And still, not a soul makes its
      presence known. The company Tomoe keeps now is only the sound of rising
      steam, and the noise of water boiling, both of which are getting
      increasingly louder with each step toward the center of the room. Both
      noises echoing in the confines of Tomoe’s past. Saying nothing, he walks
      with a heavy pace that matches his body’s sudden weight. He is nearing the
      limits of his stamina. He is closer to the glow now, now able to see where
      it emanates from: a glowing hot metallic plate. Every so often in regular
      intervals, an amount of water is set to pour on top of it, boiling it and
      turning it instantaneously into a mist of steam floating up to the
      ceiling. The ceiling itself, as far as Tomoe can see, is filled with a
      complex series of pipes absorbing the steam and funneling it into the
      canisters in the sides of the room through which they are connected. A
      respiratory system. Tomoe unconsciously does a nervous laugh as he sees
      this, and his curiosity takes him to the prominently displayed canisters.
      There are countless numbers of them, each about a head big. Though he
      can’t see them just yet, Tomoe notices that something is floating within
      the formaldehyde solution contained within the canisters. And finally he
      sees them. Brains. Human brains. The tubes he had seen before on the floor
      are the same ones in the ceiling, spreading their length around the room
      but all ultimately connected to one canister, and all ultimately leading
      upwards and through the ceiling of the underground parking lot. Probably
      connected to all the other rooms in the apartment buildings, thinks Tomoe.
      “Like a cheap dime novel horror,” he remarks quietly with a smile, and
      then walks along the perimeter of the wall. He should have thought of it
      before. There was no way the people here lived the same yesterday, down to
      the detail, every day of the month. It’d only be cause for suspicion to
      anyone outside looking in too closely, which Alaya obviously didn’t want.
      Instead, they will have small changes, little details that change every
      day. But the day, for the most part, progressed in a similar spiral. A
      time to wake up, a time to eat, a time to play, a time to work, and a time
      to die and live again. And for this, they needed them to be, on some
      level, alive. Though Tomoe finds it hard to conceive of the
      situation—bodies animated by remotely stored human minds—that is what he
      beholds before him. Every day these minds are forced to live a closed loop
      of impermanent death and uncertain rebirth, living only to die in the
      night, experiencing it with the disconnect that comes from the mind and
      body being separate. A particular brand of hell if Tomoe ever saw one: A
      prison for the soul made to resemble some crude facsimile of life that
      didn’t get the point, repeating the same dream until the sleepers can no
      longer distinguish dream from reality. Like the nightmare that kept
      plaguing Tomoe Enjō every night. Tomoe brushes his fingers lightly on the
      cold surface of one of the canisters. “Hah…I see how it is now,” he
      mutters, as the canister sends a chill running from his arm to his body.
      At that moment he hears a voice—no, not a voice; more akin to a
      communicating consciousness, emanating from the object. Did he imagine it?
      Regardless, it communicates only one thing. Save me. Tomoe chuckles
      despite the intrusion in his mind. After all, what could he save? Does it
      want to return to its original form, or perhaps escape from the cycle it’s
      trapped in? Either way, both are impossible tasks. “All I’ve proven I can
      do is kill,” says Tomoe, amused at his own irritatingly cheerless
      observation. “Besides, even I wanted to be saved. Problem was, I didn’t
      know what I wanted to be saved from. Probably better that way, since there
      was no way to save me in the end, even if we stretch the meaning of the
      word. I’ve had the impulse to kill boiling up inside me from the start,
      and now I’m past the point where saving mattered,” he utters almost
      apologetically. Now, Tomoe sets about rummaging among the canisters
      scattered along the wall, trying to find the one that curiosity and logic
      tells him he should be able to find. The lack of it would be even more
      strange than its presence. The mage Alaya didn’t kill anyone to procure
      these brains for his sick experiment, only harvested them after their
      owners all did the deed to each other. That’s why the one thing that is
      the source for Tomoe Enjō’s repeating dream—or the reality that occurred
      half a year ago—should lie somewhere in this pile. And sure enough, within
      a few short minutes, he finds the canister he was looking for. He didn’t
      want it to exist, but everything pointed to it, and now, he doesn’t know
      what to feel. He smiles a twisted smile as he touches it gently,
      fascinated as one would be when looking at a mirror that reflects him
      twisted and wrong. Finally, the proof is laid out before him. He looks
      upon himself. Two tubes extend out of it. One reaches upward to the
      ceiling, but the other is cut. A faulty machine, a discarded piece of
      equipment thrown out from the comforting safety of the regularity it once
      knew. At that point, almost on cue, a sharp sound breaks through the
      repetitive sound of the steam, and Tomoe looks to its source: the left
      elbow that had pained him most among the other parts of his body since
      yesterday. From there, he casts his eyes downward, and he sees what made
      the sound. His left arm, elbow to fingertips, fallen to the floor. He
      never felt it slough off. Blood red liquid oozes and drips from the newly
      torn limb. He looks inside the cavity of what remains of his arm, and sees
      that among the things that look like skin and bone contained within, it
      also sports objects seemingly shaped like cogs and gears. They tick,
      louder and more incessantly now, like an annoying clock, the sound of them
      strangely familiar, and almost comforting. A sound he has heard on many an
      occasion beforehand. Tomoe hears the ticking as some old memory, like
      another name for him, asserting what he really is: the person who killed
      his mother to ward off a nightmare, and, dancing to the invisible strings,
      ran from his act in shame is “…me.” Tomoe’s mind blanks, and he cannot
      prevent himself from falling to the floor on his knees. He giggles
      quietly, privately, but then it builds to the boisterous yet disturbing
      laugh of a madman, reverberating across the expanse of the empty parking
      lot. “This is ridiculous,” Tomoe says with difficulty. “Right from the
      start, right from the fucking start, I was already a phony.” He cannot
      think of anything else. Only the revelation that, on some level he had
      always known, fills him with a laugh of self-ridicule he can no longer
      contain. It’s was all bullshit, Tomoe thinks to himself. I…me and my
      family had zero chance of avoiding that tragedy, even if we repeated the
      damn act a million times. We had no way of changing how it all would end.
      We’re all just fakes, manipulated by Alaya. He knew I couldn’t do
      anything, and let me run. The ceaseless ticking in his arm and the
      multitude of ethereal voices from each mind crying out to him for help are
      all infuriatingly annoying. Irritating. Making him lose concentration. A
      maddening cacophony forcing him to slip away from the solid truth that he
      had just learned, the truth he sought for so long: that everything is a
      lie. In desperation, he edges closer to the glowing metal plate in the
      center of the room, the voices getting louder every second. He raises his
      torn off left arm and presses it onto the searing hot surface of the metal
      plate. Tomoe screams an animal scream, a guttural noise of anguish beyond
      comprehension. The stump of his left arm sizzles and smokes. The blood
      stops flowing, the wound cauterized. The ticking fades. The voices are
      slowly silenced. The pain shoots well through his entire arm and fires up
      seemingly every nerve in his body. But it is only for a few precious
      moments. Afterward, he raises his arm from the metal plate, traces of
      burnt flesh coloring its edges. He may have already gone mad. But—at least
      for now—he finds resolve, and remembers the real reason he has come back
      to this place of madness. Gasping for breath and sweating harder than he
      ever had before, Tomoe searches desperately for the elevator and finally
      finds it in a corner of the room. The light indicates it has stopped in
      the first floor. He pushes the up button and calls the machine down.
      Double checking the knife in his pocket, and slinging the sword over the
      shoulder of his good arm, he goes inside. He looks back over his shoulder
      at the room that challenged him, the room now filled only with the
      disturbing regularity of the sound of the water and the hiss of steam, and
      blanketed otherwise by silence so total that no one except the sleeping,
      dreaming souls wrapped in their lie of a life may hear the final moments
      of one who would die here. Which is the real spiral: the never-changing
      life, or the never-ending life? This building is a machine that is wrapped
      in both sides of infinity, where even dying isn’t a permanent setup. You
      just get free do-overs the next day. It’s a perfectly maintained cycle. I
      wonder if the cycle had some kind of flaw, would my mother still have
      killed me? Would I still kill my mother? It’s an impossible question to
      answer. It wouldn’t be the same life. This entire place is built on the
      death of others. Without that, this place has no meaning. Still, how I
      wish this spiral had a paradox. He makes an impossible wish with no
      answer. Tomoe feels his entire body screaming towards its final hour, but
      he still manages to push the button to take him to the tenth floor. Mikiya
      Kokutō keeps running as hard as he can, past the point where his breathing
      can keep up. He spares no moment to look back and see if Alba is following
      him. Finally, he finds that his feet have taken him inside the east wing
      lobby, and he stops. A dead end? He thinks, incredulous. Sure enough,
      aside from the stairs that leads to the second floor balcony, the place
      has nowhere else to go except where he came from. Stopping here, and
      realizing that Alba isn’t following him with the same urgency with which
      he is fleeing, gives him the moment he needs to collect himself and focus.
      Crap, why did I have to up and panic like that? Though he thought he was
      prepared for anything they might throw at him, he was evidently not
      prepared for the sight of the head of the very friend he was joking with
      just yesterday to be destroyed right in front of him. Relatively speaking,
      I handled that much the same way anyone would. Still, both his knees are
      trembling not just from nervousness but the strain of having to run at a
      pace he wasn’t used to, and he has to press down on them with both hands
      to calm down. For now, I need to find some way to get away from him. He
      quickly scans the lobby, turning in all directions. As he does this, he
      hears the heavy echo of footsteps coming from the corridor he just went
      through. This is bad. Mikiya starts running again, more composed this
      time. He makes a break for the stairs, having nowhere else to go, but no
      sooner has he climbed three steps when he hears a sharp, keening sound
      that lasts barely a second. At almost the same time, his feet lose their
      purchase on the floor, somehow deprived of what strength he had forced
      into them and forcing him to fall on the stairs on his knees. He reaches
      out with his hand toward the railing, seeking to use it to raise himself
      up, but fails. He slips downwards, back to the first floor, and collapses
      side first on to the staircase. Quickly, he looks at his legs and finds a
      dark red stain spreading downward in his slacks, originating from his
      knees. They’ve been pierced by something from behind, he observes now with
      a kind of detachment, as though it is another person’s knees he is
      examining. He feels no pain. Not just yet. The adrenaline is working its
      magic, so the wounds feel more hot than painful. “Easy now, young man.
      Can’t have you breaking your neck falling on the stairs, now can we? I
      have plans for you. Fortunately, that spell was only enough to stop you,
      and not burst your knees open at the seams.” Alba comes walking, arms
      spread wide in a sick sort of welcome. Mikiya says nothing, only trying to
      crawl his way up the stairs even as the wound has his undivided attention.
      Despite what Alba said, the blood is pouring out of the wounds as fast as
      spilled drink. Slowly, though he doesn’t realize it yet, Mikiya’s
      consciousness is fighting a losing battle. “You are a conjurer, or
      summoner, or a worker of familiars much like your mentor, are you not?
      Then call your pets forth, or suffer the shame of being unworthy of the
      moniker of a mage.” When Mikiya does nothing, Alba frowns. “Hmph. It seems
      our dear Aozaki was not as good a mentor to you as I thought. But I
      expected nothing less from her, as she is full of such flaws. The story of
      how she the Ordo granted her title is one such example. The Ordo grants
      the titles of color to the mages they deem with the most potential. I know
      that ‘Ao’ in Japanese means ‘blue,’ and true to her surname, Aozaki
      desired this rank, this highest of honors. But the Ordo judged her
      unworthy of it, instead granting it to her younger sister, who was deemed
      her family’s rightful successor, and snatched everything away from her.
      Aozaki entered the Collegium to best her sister in the Art, but even here,
      she is defeated. Ironically, she was given the title of ‘Red.’ But because
      the ‘Tō’ in her name means orange, I think it is even more appropriate for
      her! A color that seems completely unable to own up to her title of Red.
      It was perfect!” Alba reaches the foot of the stairs looming above the
      immobile Mikiya while wearing a smile of supreme satisfaction. “Count
      yourself lucky that you meet your end in the same place as your mentor.
      Being Aozaki’s apprentice, I thought that you would make a sport of
      yourself. Alas, you were nothing but a disappointment.” He takes a knee
      beside Mikiya, and extends a hand slowly towards his face. In contrast to
      Alba’s leisurely movement, Mikiya’s arm suddenly springs into action.
      “Wha— ” Alba’s surprise lasts for only a moment. But it is the only moment
      Mikiya needs to exploit. His upper body moves, bringing a hand from under
      him, brandishing a silver knife that he had hidden beneath his jacket. It
      is the silver paper opener of Tōko Aozaki, brought by Mikiya just in case,
      but thinking he would never need to use it. Now he closes his eyes shut
      and thrusts it toward Alba. It’s the first time in his life he’s ever had
      any murderous intent and actually carried it out. It is a feeling foreign
      to him, and for that reason he closed his eyes so as not to see the entire
      thing directly. The solid feeling in his hands tells him that the knife
      has struck home against…something, certainly. For sure, he knew the
      red-coated man was unprepared, then cursed but was cut short. He couldn’t
      have dodged a strike at such close quarters. Hoping that he hadn’t
      inflicted a wound too serious, Mikiya opens his eyes. His fading
      consciousness blurs his vision for a moment until it resolves into a
      coherent image…of Alba looming before him with his outstretched hand, the
      knife stuck quite deeply and straight in the center of that same hand’s
      palm. His grin is wider than ever. ------------------------------------
      ---------------------------------------------------
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      It is only a small moment of incredulity for Mikiya. But it passes like an
      hour. “What a bad boy you are to do such a thing to me,” Alba spits out
      mockingly. “It’s only fun until someone loses an eye.” As he says this, he
      extends his other hand to Mikiya, this time with haste. He grabs Mikiya by
      the face, holds it tight, raises it slightly, then slams it down onto the
      steps of the stairs. The back of Mikiya’s head makes a dull sound in the
      impact. Losing no time, he raises Mikiya’s head again, and slams it back
      down again. And again. And again. Each time, repeating the same phrase.
      “Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!” Each accompanied by
      the same dull thud, both sounds resounding in the vastness of the lobby.
      Mikiya’s grip on the knife loosens as he loses consciousness. Eventually,
      even his breath falls lighter and more desperate. At this, Alba finally
      stops and stands up. “Ah, what a pain. A pain such that would have made me
      cry. I would have wanted to let you live, but I’m sure you wouldn’t be
      able to bear the shame of it.” He extracts the bloodied knife from his
      hand as if brushing off a leaf, and nods to himself and his own words in
      approval. “Well, I do believe I’ve done what I’ve set out here to do.
      Though I do have a passing interest in Alaya’s little experiment, I do
      believe I should be getting back to Germany. The air here in Japan is not
      good for me, you see,” he says to the unmoving Mikiya. Alba turns away
      from the body, and starts walking away, heading for the corridor that
      leads back to the central lobby. But before he is able to do so, he hears
      something he doesn’t expect. Another set of footsteps echoing from that
      same corridor; high-pitched falls, the sound of which is recognizable to
      him. He, in fact, heard them only yesterday. “Impossible.” But he has no
      time to think, and soon enough, the origin of those footsteps stands in
      the lobby, large suitcase in tow. Now, as before, Tōko Aozaki blocks his
      way.
