    <p>
      I hear the sound. An ominous metallic click, coming from the other room.
      The time must be almost ten ‘o clock. Dead tired from working my job into
      the late hours of the evening, I immediately resigned myself to the safety
      of my mattress after I got home. But it isn’t even a few minutes before I
      am stirred from sleep by the sound. I heard it only once, but that is
      enough. The door to my room opens, letting a slit of white light into my
      darkened room, widening slowly with each inch of the door that is parted.
      A shadow occludes the light, and I turn to towards it only to see my mom.
      It’s always around this part that I realize, and wish that I could never
      see this scene again. The light makes it difficult to make out any detail
      on her figure save for the fact that she is standing. However, what little
      I can see of the scene beyond the doorway is clear to my eyes: my dad,
      collapsed over the dining room table. It isn’t clear at first whether he
      is merely unconscious or dead, but it isn’t long before I see what I first
      perceive to be some sort of spilled coffee. It slowly dawns on me that it
      is blood, dying the varnished brown table into a deep red. It is then that
      the shadow in front of the door speaks. “Die, Tomoe.” I remember what
      comes afterwards. My mother advances, kneels in front of me, raises the
      kitchen knife high above her, and brings it down on my chest, then up,
      then down again, too many times for me to count. Then I see her taking the
      same knife to her throat, then in a single, determined motion, plunges it
      deep into her neck. All of my nights are bookended by this nightmare, the
      worst I ever have. I hear the sound. An ominous click, through which I
      wake up. I turn my eyes toward the bed, only to find Ryōgi gone. I lift up
      my bruised and battered body to observe where I find myself in: a house in
      the nook of the second floor of a four-floor low rise, the house of the
      kimono wearing girl. Well, better to call it a room than a house, really.
      A one-meter long corridor barely deserving the label separates the front
      door and the small living room, which, seeing as the bed which she slept
      in is also there, probably also doubles as her bed room. Flanking the
      corridor to the right is the door to the bathroom. Another door in the
      living room leads to another, presumably unused, room. She led me to this
      place last night after an hour’s walk. The name plaque that rested beside
      the entryway bore the name “Ryōgi”, so that must be her last name. That
      girl—Ryōgi—never said a thing when we entered her room, only taking off
      her leather jacket and heading straight for her bed to fall asleep. Her
      apathy almost provoked me to protest, but the last thing I wanted to do
      was mouth off and have the neighbors be curious. After some consideration,
      I took a cushion lying discarded on the floor and used it as a pillow,
      then slept away. And now I wake up with her nowhere to be found. I wonder
      what she could be up to. It looks like our ages are quite close.
      Considering her age, maybe she went to school? And yet, that wouldn’t be
      at all fitting for such a drab room. The sum total of things in her room:
      a bed, a refrigerator, a phone, a coat rack with four leather jackets, and
      a closet, which I assume is for clothing. No TV, no radio, no throw-away
      magazines, and consequently, no table to read them on. I suddenly remember
      what she said last night. When I said I’d murdered someone, she said she
      was the same. I only half-believed her last night, but seeing her room, it
      might actually be true. Her pad seems to be set for functionality, like a
      room designed not to be lived in, but instead for someone who could
      suddenly be on the run at any time and could leave the room behind.
      Thinking about what she said makes a chill run up my spine. Did I think
      luck would allow me to draw the ace of spades, but instead brought me the
      joker? In any case, I don’t plan on staying any longer than I have to. I
      want to at least give a word of thanks to Ryōgi for helping me out in a
      pinch, but since she’s out, there’s really nothing I can do. With silent
      and careful steps more befitting a burglar than a visitor, I make my exit
      from the mysterious girl’s room. Without heading toward any particular
      place, I loiter around town to kill the time. Initially I am hesitant,
      even a bit scared, trying to make myself as inconspicuous as possible, and
      think at first that I made the wrong decision. But it soon becomes
      apparent that the world is turning like it always did, with no one giving
      me a second glance. The days go on with all the haste and weight of the
      hour hand on a clock. Somewhat disappointed at the realization, I make my
      way to the main avenue. It is here in the main avenue that I expected to
      find cops asking around for a Tomoe Enjō, or at least people that might
      throw me the “I saw him on the 6am news” look, but there are none. Maybe
      the bodies haven’t been found yet. Still, maybe I give myself too much
      credit. There’s no way someone like me can affect people’s reactions to a
      noticeable degree with such a half-baked murder. Either way, it seems, for
      the time being at least, I’m not a fugitive. That being said, I still
      didn’t feel like going back. Noon comes and passes, and I find myself in
      Hachikō Square, right next to Shibuya Crossing. I find a bench to rest on
      and feel content to spend an hour or two just looking up at the neon
      lights set upon the buildings stretching high into the sky. When the
      lights turn green, the cars stop to give way to the mad press of people,
      flowing like water from a burst dam across the large avenue. I can’t even
      imagine what it’s like when it’s a holiday. The people are mostly
      teenagers like me, happily smiling and with a levity to their walking
      pace, looking like they’re the most blessed individuals in the universe.
      It’s the face of people in their world: a world where they don’t aspire to
      anything anymore, or need to live for a good future. There’s no need to.
      Their life is all laid out for them, and they know that’s all they need to
      get by in their world. So how many of those smiles are real? All of them,
      or only a handful? I keep looking at their faces, trying to figure out,
      but it’s impossible to tell the real from the fake. I should have known
      better than to try, since that realization comes from your own self. Tired
      of looking at all the people moving to and fro, I instead cast my eyes
      toward the sky. Let’s be frank. I’m as much a fake as the rest of them.
      Maybe at some point in time, I thought that my life was good and real, but
      reality soon stripped that away. Junior high school was my time. I was a
      sprinter in the track and field club, and I kicked ass in it. I
      participated in all of the inter-school competitions and I never, ever
      lost. I never even saw anyone’s back. No one could say anything about my
      skill. All I cared about was cutting my time, and even a few milliseconds
      difference was enough to make me happy. I was an engine built for the
      sport, and I cherished it more than anything. It follows, of course, that
      all this came to a screeching halt. My family was never one blessed with
      an abundance of money. Dad lost his job back when I was still in grade
      school, and never got one back again. Mom was born into a rich family, but
      had a falling out with them after she ran away to marry my dad. Her world
      didn’t teach her anything about what happens after that. I think that
      broken family did only one thing right for me: force me to grow up faster
      than other kids. I had to juggle jobs after school, lying about my age
      just to get in, all so I could scrape out money to pay the tuition I
      needed. I stopped trying to care about the antics of my parents, and began
      to focus only on what I could do right by myself: sustain myself, go to
      school, and work my ass off for tuition. I thought of running as my only
      release from both the constant problem of living expenses and my parents
      who to me no longer seemed anything of the sort, the only reason I kept
      paying for school and going to the club activities without giving a heed
      to how tired I was. Our troubles only truly began when my dad took the car
      out without a license one day. He was never really good with driving, but
      it had never bothered him before if he had to take his time parking or
      maneuvering the car. That day, however, whatever luck that had compensated
      for his skill ran out, and he got involved in an accident. He ran a
      pedestrian over. It was apparently a quick death for the unlucky guy. It
      forced my mom to go back to her family, head bowed and pleading for money
      just to pay the cost for indemnities. To me it was yet another fuckup that
      I needed to look away from, and so I refrained from prying too deep. What
      eventually concerned me is the fallout from all that. It didn’t take long
      for everyone at school to find out about the incident, and though I
      thought nothing of it at first, I found that the attitude of everyone at
      school had changed. My coach, who had always been more helpful than anyone
      I could remember, suddenly started to ignore me. The upperclassmen who
      were so proud to have me as the rookie star of the track and field team
      pressured me to quit. All because of something I had no part in; all
      because I was their son. My family was the real problem. Losing what
      little money he’d saved over to help pay for the accident, my dad was far
      from fit to keep a family together. Mom started to work part-time in jobs
      society hadn’t prepared her for and she had no real idea how to do, but
      even that only paid for a portion of the gas and electricity bills. Rumors
      about the accident began to infest my neighborhood, growing and catching
      its own embellishments, to the point that dad couldn’t even get out of the
      house without so much as an angry neighbor trying to give him a piece of
      their mind. Mom still tried to work, but the rumors always caught up to
      her, and it never made her stay in one place for too long. I remember one
      time I was just walking around when some random nobody threw a rock at me.
      And always, there were the threats. Yet even though the abuses got worse
      and worse, I never could muster the motivation to be mad at them. After
      all, the one driving the car, the one really at fault then was my dad.
      It’s all his fault. But then it’s not like I hated my folks in particular
      back then either, because it’s when I realized that whatever you do, even
      if you try as hard as you can, no matter how fast and how far you run,
      it’ll all be the same. You can’t escape your family, your past, or what
      you are. I mean, my folks walked their own path, tried to live a life as
      best they could, and look where it got them. That’s when I stopped trying
      to fight it. I figured if I just accepted it, then I wouldn’t have
      anything to cry about. It’s the moment when you’re a kid and you throw
      away your fantasies because they’re useless, and in its place grows a kind
      of new, self-crafted wisdom. After that, feeling that there was little
      else it could teach me, I quit school. Besides, I had to work whole days
      now for the money. If you aren’t picky there’s plenty of work to be done
      even for people my age. Being someone still straddled with at least half a
      conscience, I couldn’t completely abandon my family, and so I had to put
      money in the house. Still, that didn’t mean I needed to talk to them. I
      never did after I quit high school. Slowly, like a poison, the joy and
      exhilaration in running and sprinting that I’d once found essential faded
      into dim memory, along with the faces of the people who once cheered me
      on, and the cold wind whipping past my face. It was something I’d thought
      I couldn’t ever live without at one point, and to find that I’d
      essentially thrown it away gave me no small measure of surprise. My mind
      made its customary excuses: I didn’t need it anymore, there were more
      important things. But they were only excuses. I lost. I gave up. That’s
      the proof that I’m fake. If “running” was some sort of origin, a cosmic
      impetus laid out for the boy known as Tomoe Enjō, then I had failed it.
      And maybe, my mind thought, things would have turned out better if I had
      just indulged that call. My parents took me to see a stud farm once when I
      was little. There I looked at all the nameless horses, whose lives were
      bred and figures built solely for the singular act of running, and I
      cried, thinking that if such a thing as a previous incarnation was truer
      than a tale spun for the naïve idea of destiny, then I must surely have
      been one of those beautiful beasts. My passion was born there. And it was
      killed by the weight of the real. I ultimately amounted to nothing more
      than a sham, imbued with dreams that only lie. And in the end, I became a
      murderer. I laugh, though there is nothing truly funny about it. The sky I
      look at hardly changes, and I turn my eyes back to the spectacle of the
      city, where at least the people move, never stopping, with their smiling
      and content faces, all of us dolls as fake as anyone else with no real
      purpose. Or maybe they do have a real purpose: to fool around. They are in
      Shibuya after all. That’s the brand of reality I can’t really tolerate,
      though. The collective footsteps of the throng bring me back to reality.
      Positioned above the entryway to a nearby building is a clock, showing the
      time nearing evening. Not wanting to loiter here any more than I’ve
      already allowed myself, I push myself up and out of the bench and leave
      the mass of people, heading for no particular direction. Even here in the
      housing district the streetlamps shine no brighter than in any other part
      of the city. I’ve been walking aimlessly for the past three hours, and the
      autumn sun has long since set, reminding me that I still need a place to
      stay for the night. Without thinking about it, I find myself back in the
      familiar façade of Ryōgi’s apartment building. Though I always thought
      that I could let go of lingering affections easily when the situation
      demanded it, judging by where my wandering feet took me, it seems that’s
      not the case. I look to the second floor, and find that her window is
      dark. Looks like she isn’t home. “Well, since I’m here anyway…” I mutter
      under my breath as I start to climb the stairs to the second floor,
      squaring myself with the fact that the only reason I’m doing this is to
      hang on pathetically to the last person that helped me in my life. The
      metal treaded staircase rings a harsh sound as I ascend as if to announce
      my presence. Confronting the door of Ryōgi’s room, I find that the
      newspaper that was slipped under her door as I left this morning is
      nowhere to be found. At first I think that she’s inside, but when I rap on
      the door, no response follows. So she came home at least once. Deciding to
      leave if the door is locked, I reach for the doorknob and turn it. But it
      moves unhindered, and the door slips ever so slightly open. As I saw back
      in the street, the lights inside look like they aren’t turned on. In the
      silence, even the mechanical clicking of the doorknob is audible, and for
      a moment, it freezes my hand and blanks my mind in hesitation. Thinking
      myself ridiculous for standing there doing nothing for such a long time, I
      slowly widen the opening I’ve made and creep inside. I probably would
      never have thought as a kid that I would be committing trespass after
      killing someone not a few days earlier, and yet here I am. Well, she did
      say I was welcome in her house, but I don’t know if this is what she meant
      by that. While my mind is busy making excuses, my body is creeping
      forward, closing the door, going past the entrance, past the short
      corridor, and finally into her living room. It’s black as pitch in here.
      Nothing can be heard except my muffled footsteps and my suspiciously rough
      respiration. Man, this makes me look like any random break and enter.
      Fuck, I need a light. The lights, where the fuck are the lights? I start
      to take a hand to the wall and feel around for the switch. At that point,
      I hear the distinct sound of the front door opening. The person turns on
      the lights faster than I could even begin to consider who it is. As the
      fluorescent lamp casts a warm glow over the room, she looks at me with
      slightly surprised eyes that blink twice before she starts talking. “Oh,
      you’re here. I hope you weren’t doing anything inappropriate, what with
      lights being off and all,” she says in the manner of someone just berating
      a classmate. She closes the door and takes off her jacket, then sits down
      on her bed, rifling through the plastic bag she’s holding and producing a
      small cup. “Wanna eat it? Cold things just don’t do it for me.” She tosses
      the cup toward me, and up close I can see that it’s a cup of Haagen-Dazs
      strawberry. Why she doesn’t care about my trespassing is as much a mystery
      to me as her buying something she doesn’t even like. Taking the cold cup
      in my hands makes me think. She knows I’m a murderer, though I don’t know
      how seriously she takes it. And yet she offered her room to me. I remember
      what I thought this morning: that her room looked like she was some sort
      of fugitive ready to run at a moment’s notice. “Square one thing with me,
      Ryōgi,” I say to her. “Are you someone I should be keeping one eye open
      for when I sleep?” Contrary to what I expect, she laughs quite heartily at
      my question.”You’re a strange one, aren’t you? A nice way to phrase that
      question, I have to say,” she says in between bouts of raucous laughter
      that throws her already mismanaged hair into even greater disarray. The
      sight only tells me to be more cautious than before. At length, her
      laughter finally starts to die down, and she exhales one long breath
      before she continues to talk. “Hah, well, it’s true that this place has a
      shortage of people that can carry themselves in a fight better than I can.
      But hey, you’re here aren’t you? Since we’re both stuck with our
      respective pieces of wood in each other’s eye, let’s just leave them in
      there and keep our peace. Is that all you wanted to talk about?” The
      kimono-clad girl looks up at me with a dangerously calm countenance of a
      child expecting to get a new present, her grin laden with meaning. “No,
      there’s something else I need to ask. Why did you help me?” “’Cause you
      asked me to, that’s why. I wasn’t doing anything at the time anyway, so
      hey, what the hell. By the way, you don’t have a place to sleep right? I
      meant it when I said you could use my place for now. Not like Mikiya’s
      going to come by in a while, anyway.” Because she wasn’t doing anything?
      What the hell kind of reason is that? My brain might be a bit frazzled
      lately, but not to the extent that I’d believe what she just said. I glare
      at her, which seems to garner no reaction. She only ignores me, not—I
      sense—out of indifference, but of a dignified sort of oblivion that just
      comes naturally to her. It’s an alluring paradox. Still, I realize that
      Ryōgi hasn’t given me any real reason to lie to me. Maybe she does have no
      particular reason to take me in. She could have invented any number of
      excuses to leech money from me by doing this, but she didn’t. But even so…
      “Are you serious? You take me in no questions asked without even being
      suspicious of me? You sure you aren’t high?” “You are seriously damaging
      your goodwill here, buddy. And to answer your question seriously, no I
      don’t take drugs, and to answer the question percolating in your mind, no
      I didn’t report you to the police this morning. Although I will if you
      tell me to.” Well, nothing to worry about on that front. Besides, just the
      thought of this person talking to the police in polite tones seems like an
      impossible picture to paint in my mind. “Then what are you after? Is it a
      quick fuck, because—” “Huh? There’s far better places a man can go to for
      sex in this town than my place, that’s for damn sure.” “Well, see, what
      I’m saying is—” “Alright, fine, whatever man! If you don’t like it here
      and you’re just gonna stand there and criticize me then you know the way
      to the door, buddy. I absolutely do not understand why you feel the need
      to judge every word out of my mouth, you know that?” Her words brook no
      refusal. A silence hangs between us, but is broken by her rummaging
      through the plastic convenience store bag again, pulling out a
      triangularly-shaped tomato sandwich. Well, if I had any doubts about
      whether or not she thought nothing of me before, I don’t now. “Well…then
      I’m sleeping over! You said it was fine, didn’t you?” I say maybe a bit
      too loudly. Ryōgi, for her part, doesn’t even seem all that angry, even
      though her words seem to indicate otherwise. “Yeah, go ahead. I’ll be sure
      to tell you if your asshole glands are working up again,” she says while
      nibbling on the sandwich. At that, I suddenly realize how tired I am and
      promptly sit myself down on the floor. Time passes, but I can’t seem to
      give a mind to how long or how short that lasts. I turn my thoughts away
      from my little spat with Ryōgi to more practical matters. I’d found a
      place to sleep, if only temporarily. The 30,000 yen in loose change I
      hastily took with me should last me the month for food, but finding some
      way to work so I can survive while still hiding from the cops is going to
      be key. Wait. Now I remember what I was supposed to ask Ryōgi. How could I
      forget? “Hey,” I call to her. “Why ain’t your door locked?” “Lost the key,
      obviously.” Her answer is almost like a blow to the back of my head. “I
      only lock the door when I’m sleeping, and I just close the door when I’m
      out. Works for me, and as you can see, not much here for a burglar to
      burgle.” So my attempted trespassing wasn’t just some lucky coincidence.
      Her not locking the room might even be the reason for why she barely has
      anything in the room. Some regular thief could be slipping in and just
      stealing what isn’t nailed down. It’s too much of an assault on my regular
      sensibility that I have to tell her off. “Christ, girl. You could at least
      ask for a spare one from the landlord.” “Lost the spare too. C’mon, it’s
      not as if you have to worry about it, and it’s not as if I need one.” It’s
      really starting to grate on me how she just takes everything in stride. I
      can’t have any sort of peace of mind without a key. Meanwhile, Ryōgi here
      seems to lack the part of your brain that’s supposed to sound warning
      alarms when you aren’t secure even in your own home. I forget about my
      anger toward her some minutes ago and replace it with worry for this
      reckless girl. “A house without a key ain’t a house. Just you wait; I’ll
      get you a new key.” An idea suddenly forms in my mind. I remembered the
      last job I managed to hold down, until two days ago at least, was in a
      moving company. I got to learn a few things about fixing some household
      related stuff, so a simple doorknob replacement wouldn’t be beyond me.
      They must have some kind of regular doorknob in that warehouse of theirs.
      “No, scratch that. I’ll replace the whole damn thing.” “Well, whatever
      floats your boat. Do you have money for it?” “Of course I do. It’s the
      least I could do for you. In fact, I’ll even do it tonight, so you’ll have
      no problem tomorrow!” And on saying that, I stand up immediately, filled
      with a force of will whose origin even I couldn’t even begin to guess. I
      run towards the entrance, twist the doorknob, swing open the door, and
      break out into a run into the city canopied by night, barely allowing
      Ryōgi a word in edgewise. Here I am, a wanted (or soon-to-be-wanted) man
      sprinting to a moving company I planned to rob in the dead of night,
      putting some serious thought into how I could slip in without getting
      caught. Forget Ryōgi. Going on this little excursion for a girl whose
      first name I didn’t even know pretty much makes me the certified crazy
      one.
