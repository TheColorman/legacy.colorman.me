    <h1 class="title">Paradox Spiral - I</h1>
    <p>
      In the first few days of October, the streets already blow over with the
      bitter cold. Winds with fingers of ice grant gentle caresses to the lamp
      posts and dumpsters. Usually, the city still looked alive at this hour, at
      10 o’ clock in the evening. But tonight is different. Tonight, scattered
      pools of light in the streets, from display stores to the street lamps,
      only serve to accentuate the little shadows and silhouettes playing across
      them. Winter is coming early this year, and considering the temperature,
      it wouldn’t be at all out of place to discover snow falling tonight. The
      silhouettes of people exiting the train station, jackets worn and collars
      fluttering in the wind, lack all the life they normally have. Like
      automatons, they walk at brisk paces to their homes, not stopping for a
      look at a display window or a warm cup of coffee. They hurry because they
      all want the warmth and familiarity of their homes. From the wave of
      people, to the heat that refuses to gather, and even the shops whose
      lights seem just a little bit dimmer; the boy witnesses all of it. He sits
      beside a vending machine situated in a little nook beside the avenue, idly
      watching the people exiting the train station. Almost as if to hide
      himself, he sits hugging his legs to his chest, and he cuts a pitifully
      thin figure that makes it hard to determine his gender from afar. His
      hair, arranged like a bundle of unkempt straw, is dyed red. He looks to be
      around the age of sixteen or seventeen. His eyes are narrowed, yet they
      don’t seem to be particularly interested in anything. He shivers under
      strange clothes: dirty jeans and a blue jacket one or two sizes too big
      for him, with nothing else to cover his top. It isn’t surprising to see
      him with teeth chattering. He sits there for a long time, and just when
      the number of people exiting the station begins to thin noticeably, he
      finds himself surrounded by a number of other people. “Yo, Tomoe,” says
      one of them, not even attempting to hide the scorn in it. The red-haired
      boy doesn’t respond. “Ah c’mon, Enjō, don’t be a dick and ignore us,” he
      persists. Lifting the boy by his jacket, he forces the boy from the
      ground. The boy saw all of them now, five people surrounding him, stand at
      almost the same height as he does, and it is easy to tell their ages are
      not so far apart. “What, just ‘cuz you stopped going to school, we
      strangers now?” The same person continues. “Oh, now I get it. Our little
      Tomoe is a fucking grown up now, so he don’t talk to kids like us anymore,
      eh?” The rest of his companions all snicker in response. But when the
      noise dies down, Tomoe continues to ignore them. Frustrated, the boy
      holding Tomoe by the jacket lets it go with a grunt, only to bring his
      hand back up in a fist, punching Tomoe in the face. He collapses back to
      the ground, and he hears a distinct clinking sound of something metallic
      falling out of his pocket. “Hey, don’t even think about sleepin’, man.”
      More laughter. Hearing that clinking sound seems to jolt Tomoe Enjō from
      whatever state of shock he had been suffering up to now. He whispers his
      own name, like some sort of resuscitative ritual, remembering who he was,
      why he was here. With senses regained, he looks at the boys surrounding
      him, finally remembering them as his classmates, former “friends.” Normal
      students who played at being adult. Preying on weak people like me, Tomoe
      thinks. “Aikawa, right?” says Tomoe. “Hell you doing here at this hour?”
      “Right back at you, man. We all been worried you be suckin’ dick behind
      the restaurants just to get by. I mean, seeing as you’re such a girl. Am I
      right?” He gestures and looks over his shoulder toward his compatriots.
      Because of his overly thin build, Tomoe has been called a girl in school
      for as long as he can remember. He never paid any heed to it, and that is
      largely how he reacts now. However, he does pick up the empty aluminum can
      he had been drinking from some minutes ago. “Hey, Aikawa,” Tomoe calls.
      Aikawa returns his attention to him. “Wha—“ As soon as Tomoe sees that
      pimple-ridden face turn towards him, mouth half open to speak, he thrusts
      the can violently into it, twisting the can as deeply as he can inside
      Aikawa’s mouth. He quickly follows it up by slapping the can as hard as he
      can muster. Now it is Aikawa’s turn to collapse. Tomoe’s slap partially
      crushed the can, causing the surface to bend sharply in places, and when
      Aikawa coughs it up on the ground, both the can and his mouth are dripping
      with blood. Aikawa’s companions are dumbstruck. They thought they would
      just mess with their former classmate, maybe even take some of his money.
      It never occurred to them that it would turn to violence. “Still shit for
      brains, I see,” Tomoe remarks wryly. Then he kicks him sharply and
      repeatedly in the head, almost like he wants to kill him, a stark contrast
      to his seemingly uninterested demeanor earlier. Aikawa doesn’t move an
      inch, though whether it’s because he’s unconscious or his neck is broken,
      Tomoe doesn’t know. After a few quick kicks, Tomoe makes a break for it,
      before Aikawa or his cronies can come to their senses. Thinking the crowd
      will just slow him down, Tomoe turns instead towards one of the side
      alleys where he can make good his escape in the sharp, confusing turns.
      It’s only a second or two after he starts running that the group he left
      behind start to process what just happened before them. He hears their
      angry calls as they start after him. “Asshole thinks he can just do this
      to us? Let’s kill that son of a bitch!” says a voice echoing in the
      alleyways, whipping his companions into a frenzy. Through the capillaries
      of the city, they chase Tomoe like live game, baying for blood. “Kill that
      son of a bitch.” I let the words bounce around in my head, and I laugh
      heartily to myself. I heard the verve in their voice, heard how serious
      they were, and they would probably follow through on it when they catch up
      to me. But they’re faking it, as much as anyone else who says it jokingly.
      They don’t know what happens to you after you do it for the first time.
      They don’t know what killing someone does to a person. But see, I do. I
      killed someone, just before I went to the train station. I remember
      gripping the knife, and feeling the tenderness each time I stabbed. Just
      thinking back on it makes me shiver and want to throw up. My teeth start
      to chatter again, and my mind recoils on the memory with the force of a
      hurricane. Those guys don’t understand how far it removes you, and that’s
      why they can say they’ll “kill” as if they’re just going for a little
      walk. Guess I’ll be the one to teach them, then. I focus my mind and allow
      my laughter to recede into a little smile. I don’t consider myself a
      particularly violent guy. I believe in an eye for an eye, but tonight’s
      the first time I’ve ever busted someone up who just hit me.
      Disproportional response. It ain’t like me, but I did it. Maybe because I
      actually liked the feeling of not holding back. I come to a narrow alley
      sandwiched between two buildings, far from the main road and any curious
      eyes or ears. I stop here, right at the corner, thinking it a prime spot
      for the act. Before long, they catch up, and things happen in snapshots of
      time. One of them, ahead of the others, rounds the corner of the alley,
      and I take a fraction of a second to confirm it’s who I want it to be
      before I spring on him. The palm of my left hand shoots up to connect with
      his jaw. I think fast. In an amateur fistfight, it often comes down to
      endurance in an exchange of blows. I know I don’t have a hair’s breadth of
      a chance winning like that, especially outnumbered, so if I’m going to do
      this, I do it to kill them one by one, without hesitation, before I’m
      surrounded. The guy I just hit tries to return the favor, but before that
      happens, I thrust a finger into his left eye. It feels kind of like
      slightly hard jell-o when I twist my finger around. His scream is enough
      to send a chill down anyone’s spine. Before he has time to regain their
      composure, though, I grab the guy’s head and, putting my whole body behind
      it, finish him off by slamming the head into the wall. A dull thud as it
      makes impact with the concrete, and when I let go of him, his body slides
      against the wall towards the ground, the back of his head leaving a lazy
      blood trail on the wall and his left eye a dripping, bloody mess. Still,
      he’s probably not dead from just that. I pull my eyes away from him to
      meet the other four still coming, and if I’m lucky, they’ll be just that
      little bit hesitant after they heard their friend screaming his guts out.
      When the rest of them turn the corner, they are immediately taken aback at
      the sight of their friend. Just as I thought, they are unprepared. They’ve
      probably seen their share of accidentally spilled blood in street fights,
      but they’ve never seen a body that looks like it’s bleeding its life out
      on the asphalt. Wasting no time, I attack the nearest guy, slapping him,
      and then grabbing him by the hair. I lower his head fast, then bring my
      knee up to his kindly waiting face. A low crunching sound tells me that I
      may have broken his nose. I give him three more kneeings for good measure,
      then bring my elbow down at his skull. The impact is a painful shockwave
      traversing my arm for a brief moment. Two down. My knee is a dark red,
      soaked in the second man’s blood. “Enjō, you motherfucker!” That last one
      finally pushes the rest of them over the edge. Without any sense of reason
      or forethought, they jump into the brawl all at the same time. That’s when
      I know I’m done. I can’t take on three guys at the same time, and they
      prove me right. They lash out punches and kicks, pushing me back against
      the same wall I slammed their friend against not moments ago until they
      force me to the ground. I feel the knuckles digging into my cheeks, and I
      reel from every kick that lands on my stomach. Nevertheless, they’re not
      fighting the same way I did earlier. No ferocity. They’re not gonna kill
      me. They don’t want to. And yet, if they keep this up, they will
      eventually kill me. They won’t know that they’ll break bones, cause
      internal bleeding, and make it more difficult for me to breathe. The fact
      that my death will be a slow slide into nothingness instead of a quick and
      easy one grants me a measure of anguish. See? Even if they don’t mean to,
      people still end up killing other people. As the hits continue to land on
      my body, I wonder: Between people like me who truly seek to kill, and
      people like them who will just commit an unintentional homicide, who
      carries it heavier in the end? My body is already covered in bruises, but
      the pain is becoming routine, almost welcoming now. I’m sure that bunch
      are getting really into it in their own way, too. It won’t be long before
      they start to enjoy it, and they won’t be able to stop themselves. “Now
      don’t we look cute with that face, Enjō?” says one of them. He thrusts his
      foot keenly into my chest, and my violent coughing immediately afterwards
      leaves the taste of blood in my mouth. I’m down for the count, and I
      realize I have maybe a precious few seconds before they completely beat
      the life out of me, the same life that I never valued as anything above
      expendable. A fist hits my eye, and half my vision goes dark. At that
      moment, I hear a faint sound. Then a beat of silence. Another beat. They
      don’t seem to be moving. The noise resounds again like a bell: the
      singular, clacking tone of wood. With pained eyes I see the three guys,
      heads already turned towards the sound emanating from the alley’s
      entrance. I train my vision to the same direction even as the swelling in
      my eyes grow more painful as I move them. My mind stops. Silhouetted
      against the mouth of the alley is a person who clearly doesn’t belong
      here. The clacking sound we’d all heard earlier comes from the person’s
      wooden geta footwear; the dark finish, red strap, and oval shape clear
      even from this distance. A woman’s geta. The clothing on the figure is
      peculiar to say the least: a red leather jacket atop a dead plain orange
      kimono. The shadow advances, each step like a reverberating wooden bell.
      The person’s movement is a hypnotic sway of clothes and carelessly cut
      ink-black hair that invite surrender, and I almost forget myself.
      Wraithlike white skin, and eyes of clear void. Surely not the usual
      everyday sight in a backlane filled with scattered bottle shards and
      discarded syringes. A woman…a girl. I almost can’t tell her gender, but
      somehow, I know she’s a girl. “Hey,” she calls out, continuing to venture
      deeper into the alley and closer to us. The three who had surrounded me
      now break off to meet her. It’s painfully obvious what they’re planning on
      doing to the girl. “Ain’t nothing for you here, lady.” The trio flex their
      fingers for a new round of violence, the excitement in their gait barely
      contained. They move to surround the lone girl. Unable to move more than
      an inch, and with my speech coming out as strained gasps of air, I can do
      nothing except to curse them in my mind. I chose this place so as not to
      involve anyone else, and yet here she is in defiance of all probability.
      And now, no doubt only because she chose to turn the wrong alley for a
      shortcut home, she’ll be a victim as well. “I ain’t playing, girl!” one of
      the three shouts. “Don’t you got ears to hear what I just said?” The girl
      is silent again now, but in a flash, she extends a hand, using it to grab
      the arm of one of the approaching boys. She pulls. Her posture changes
      subtly to one that puts her entire weight behind the action, and her
      purchase on the boy’s arm then forces him to the ground in one violent
      motion. Watching it from where I lie, the entire thing seemed to go
      frame-by-frame, as if I was turning the handcrank on an old viewing
      machine. The remaining two attempt to close in on the girl, and she
      immediately strikes the closest one in the chest with her palm, causing
      him to crumple like a ragdoll to the ground, unconscious. It amazes me
      that she knocks them out of commission with such ease, all in the space of
      about five or so seconds, while I exerted so much effort to take out an
      equal number of people. The last one must have realized this fact as well,
      since as soon as the second man is down he starts to turn on his heels and
      run screaming. She soon ends that with a swift roundhouse kick delivered
      straight to the guy’s head, with barely the noise of rustling clothes to
      its credit. Like the previous two, he is rendered unconscious. “Ouch.
      Literally hard head on that last one,” she grumbles as she fixes the
      creases on her kimono. I keep my eyes fixed on her, wondering if she’s
      even going to talk to me. It’s strange but not altogether uncomforting
      that I can still slightly distinguish her form in this isolated place,
      even in the absence of light. “Hey, mister punching bag,” she calls out as
      she turns to me. I try to speak but it only results in me coughing. She
      reaches inside a pocket in her leather jacket and pulls a small object
      out, throwing it on the ground within my reach. “Dropped it back there on
      the street. S’yours, right?” I turn my eyes sideways to look at it, and
      see a single, shining key. It must have fallen out of my pocket when the
      guys were roughing me up. My key to a house that I’ve already tried to
      stop caring about. She must have come here just to give it back to me. She
      turns her back on me without a single word and starts to make her way back
      out of the alley with all the airiness of her previous entrance: the
      relaxed gait of a casual night stroll, leaving me lying on the ground to
      fend for myself. “Wai—,” the word comes half-formed out of my mouth, and I
      reach out my hand towards her. Though I’m hesitant to call more attention
      than I needed to from a girl who just took out three guys in the time it
      took me to take out one, I couldn’t stand just being left here like a fake
      toy, lost among the refuse of the city. “Wait.” The word comes out, though
      in a weak breath. I try to redouble the strength in my voice and shout.
      “Just wait, for crying out loud!” I try to stand, and every bone in my
      body throbs with pain from the attempt. I end up having to support my
      half-standing posture with a hand on the wall, itself aching from having
      to exert pressure. At least my noisemaking manages to stop the girl, who
      now directs her cold gaze in my direction. “What now?” she says, her voice
      still as calm as before. “Look, if you dropped anything else, good luck
      finding it.” “Are you just going to leave these dudes here?” I manage to
      protest in between bouts of labored breathing. The girl in the kimono
      takes in the scene around her, casting her eyes downwards almost as if
      it’s her first time looking at it. Her sight lingers on the two persons
      who I took care of in my haphazard, improvised fashion, then finally looks
      back at me with upturned eyes and a curious sigh. “You don’t have to worry
      about them. That one,” she says, motioning her head towards the first of
      the two, “will probably get an eyepatch and be doomed to do pirate
      impressions for the rest of his life. The other will have trouble
      breathing with his nose for a while. But no one’s dead. I’d be much more
      worried about what the first guy who wakes up will do to you. And yet,
      here you are, implying that we should get them some help?” “I…guess?” I
      respond. “Well see, that puts us in a pickle. Who do we call, hmm? The
      police? An ambulance, maybe?” Her eyes narrow with each sentence that
      prods me. I wasn’t thinking about calling the police. Maybe the hospital.
      But they’d ask questions. If I mentioned self-defense…maybe the police
      would be faster, but— “Five-oh are out of the question.” “And why is
      that?” she asks, but it feels like she already knows the answer. Her eyes
      continue to bore into me. There’s no use in hiding it anymore. She’s got
      me, and if I tried to hide it, she’ll just ask more questions. And so I
      say it. “Because…I’m a murderer.” As I say it out loud, as much to myself
      as to her, time seems to stop and all things grow silent. Far from my
      expectation of her being shocked, however, she only walks toward me. Her
      eyes scan me up and down. “Well, you don’t look like one.” She looks me
      over, an eyebrow cocked and a hand on chin and lip paused in pensive
      observation. Overtaken by the moment, and feeling quite shocked by her
      doubt, I feel compelled to explain. “It’s true! It weren’t a few hours
      ago, I swear. I took a kitchen knife and stabbed her over and over in the
      stomach until everything was all wet and mushy, then I cut off her head.
      You can’t tell me she ain’t dead after that!” I start to snicker in spite
      of myself. “The five-oh are all probably in my house wondering where the
      fuck I’ve gone, all scratching their heads ‘cause of another late night
      job. Just you wait, I’ll be all over the morning news tomorrow!” It took
      me a while to notice that I was making a sort of strange laugh after I
      said that, the kind of noise that lies somewhere in that ambiguous space
      between laughter and sobbing. The kimono-clad girl gives me time to calm
      myself down before talking again. “Right,” she says, unsurprised. “Well,
      cool, I guess. You’ve convinced me. Let’s put off contacting anyone unless
      you want your mornings to have significantly more iron bars than usual.
      Guess that explains why you’re shirtless. I thought that was what all the
      cool kids run with these days.” Her cold fingers brush over my chest with
      a light, almost curious touch. “Hey,” I say, but with little force behind
      it. She was right. I dumped my shirt since it was covered in so much blood
      I’d get noticed easily. I just grabbed my jacket to compensate as I ran
      out of the house. “Ain’t you even gonna say something about me? I really
      did kill someone. You think I’m just gonna let you go, knowing what you
      know? Ain’t no difference between killing one person or two.” That seems
      to grab her attention. She brings her face closer to mine, eyes
      half-closed in disappointment. “Yes,” she sighs. “There is.” “There is
      what?” “A difference.” Her presence is almost overpowering, even though I
      stand a head higher than her and she’s the one looking up at me. Her empty
      eyes never stop staring at me, and I gulp involuntarily. I’ve never seen
      anything like them before. The black irises are a tempting well that
      threatens to drown you endlessly. In my seventeen years, I’ve thought
      people can be many things: cruel, deceptive. But never beautiful. So
      overwhelmingly beautiful that I almost forget myself. “I’m…a murderer,” I
      declare again. I feel that there is nothing more to say. The girl casts
      her bewitching glance away from me and lowers her head. “I know. I’m one
      of those, too.” She doesn’t explain further. There is no need to. She
      turns on her heels, and with the wind ruffling her clothes and the sound
      of her geta on the asphalt she starts to leave. I didn’t want her to
      disappear. Not tonight. “Wait!” I run to catch up to her, but with my
      injuries still getting the better of me, I fall to the ground. I stand up
      again, and look straight at the girl, unwavering. “If we really are the
      same breed of person, then help me,” I yell with such uncharacteristically
      reckless abandon, casting away reason and shame. The girl’s eyes open in
      surprise. “Same breed? Well, I certainly know what it feels like to have
      that empty space in your chest. But what do you expect me to help you
      with? The crime of your murder, or taking care of your wounds? Either way,
      I can’t do anything for you.” “Sooner or later, someone will spot us here.
      Maybe you could hide me.” She ponders the suggestion with a scratch of her
      head and annoyed grumbling, probably the most human thing she’s done so
      far. “Are you saying I should help you go find some place where you can
      hole up?” “Yeah, someplace no one would think to try and find me.” “It
      isn’t like there aren’t eyes all over this city, man. The only place
      you’re really ever likely to find any privacy is your own home,” she says,
      making a perplexed expression. “Aren’t you fucking listening?” I
      inadvertently shout. “I’m asking you ‘cause I can’t go back to my house!
      Maybe you could, oh, I dunno, take me to your house, asshole!” The words
      are out of my mouth before I can stop them. The pain is making me lose my
      temper. At first I think I’m going to regret saying that, but the girl
      just nods in understanding, letting the entire thing slide. “That it?
      Well, that’s a simple request. If my house is fine with you, then you’re
      welcome to stay.” Without even helping me to stand up by myself or
      offering a helping hand, she starts to walk again, the movement of her
      back telling me to keep close and follow. With renewed strength to my step
      that I didn’t know from where in my battered body I obtained, I pursue
      her. The sound of her clacking steps, and the sensation of the asphalt and
      broken bottle glass beneath my feet seemed to make both the pain on my
      body and mind ebb. Though I haven’t even asked her if she lived alone, or
      even what her name was, I think it too insignificant for the moment. I
      only see her silhouette, dimly lighted, guiding me like fate. It is the
      only thing I can see.
