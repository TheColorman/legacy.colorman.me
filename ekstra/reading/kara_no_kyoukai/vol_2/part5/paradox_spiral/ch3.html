    <h1 class="title">Paradox Spiral - III</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve been living with Ryōgi for close to a week now. Over time, we’ve
      established a simple pattern to our lifestyle. She wakes up, sometimes
      going out earlier than me. Sometime later, I go out for the day as well,
      and we only really see each other’s faces again when I come back to sleep
      at night. It’s strange business to be sure. At some point, we gave each
      other our names, thinking that it’d be quite strange to not know each
      other’s names when it’s obvious I’d be over for some time. Shiki Ryōgi. A
      repeating high school student…well, on paper at least, considering her
      current truant history. That’s pretty much the sum total of what I know
      about her. She calls me by my last name, Enjō, which is why I might be
      given to referring to her similarly as Ryōgi. She’s said more than once
      that she didn’t like being called by her surname, but I can’t bring myself
      to call her Shiki. It’s a pretty simple reason. Calling someone by their
      first name has always seemed to me to be like some stamp of permanence,
      but this daily life right now is as temporary a setup as I can imagine,
      which means someday, me and Ryōgi will part ways. At any given time I
      could be actively hunted by the police. I could be forced to run. Calling
      her Shiki, with all the baggage that the first name tends to give you,
      will just weigh me down when that day comes. “Don’t you have a girlfriend,
      Enjō?” On this night, like all the other nights, Ryōgi sits cross-legged
      atop her bed, and as always, asks me a question that seems to come
      straight out of nowhere. As for me, rolling around on the floor right next
      to her bed, I’ve long become accustomed to them. “If I had one, I wouldn’t
      need to swing by this dump every night, would I?” “That’s kind of strange,
      considering you’re not all that shabby looking.” “That actually sounds
      more like an insult than a complement, coming from you. And besides, I’ve
      had enough of women.” “Interesting. Why, I wonder?” She lies down on the
      bed, which from my position on the floor next to it, makes her temporarily
      unseen, though she soon pops her head out directly above mine. She’s
      actually kind of cute like this. “Are you gay?” I take that back. Seeing
      her as anything resembling cute must have been a trick of the mind. “No
      way. It’s just that, well…I’ve got a history with girls, and it didn’t
      work out too well.” Before I know it, I’m already reminiscing with her.
      “Back in high school, I went out with a girl for two months, and we spent
      most of that quality time arguing. I didn’t want anything special from the
      relationship, but she certainly did. She wanted all the cool, fancy things
      that also happened to be expensive. I could practically hear my wallet
      screaming at the time, but I still did it for her. When I could buy her
      things, she was happy. When I couldn’t, she complained. That didn’t warm
      me to the experience. And the sex wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be,
      honestly. Besides, I could’ve just jacked off if I wanted to feel good.” I
      thought this story would bore Ryōgi, but she actually seems to be hanging
      on every word, so I continue with a sigh. “Eventually, I started to
      dislike her. All the money and affection I gave her slowly looked more
      like a waste of time. Maybe if I was a normal student, I could’ve given
      her more of my time, but as it stood then, I didn’t have that kind of
      freedom. The hours I spent with her started draining any hours I had left
      for sleep. Without the free time, I guess it was doomed from the start.
      But, stupid as I was, I never tried breaking up with her. I never liked to
      hurt or get hurt, and it was definitely one of those times where I
      could’ve made her cry.” “But you did break up with her, didn’t you? How
      did you do it?” Ryōgi asks, intrigued. “Hey, I ain’t the bad guy here. She
      dumped me. One night, after we had sex at a motel, she turned towards me
      on the bed and said—and this is a direct quote I swear—that I never really
      looked at her. That I only looked at her appearance and not her heart. Now
      that was a real sucker punch right there.” Before I even finish talking, I
      already hear the spasms of laughter from Ryōgi going from chuckle to
      guffaw. When I shrug my shoulders as I finish my story, her head
      disappears back toward the bed, and she finally lets the suppressed
      laughter out. “Wow, you are a piece of work, Enjō! ‘Didn’t look at her
      heart?’ That was a girl with a lot of baggage, I can tell you that.” I
      hear the springs on her bed creaking as she rolls to and fro in her bed,
      laughing accusatorily. “Well, at least I never made the mistake of making
      fun of children’s love. It ain’t funny.” I stand up, indignant, which
      makes Ryōgi restrain her laughter by degrees. She rubs her eyes before she
      sits up and looks at me straight. “But it is funny, Enjō. You just don’t
      see it. I mean, look, what’s the only thing people can see of other
      people? Their appearance! She thinks her appearance is so insignificant,
      and yet she forces you to buy all that flashy bullshit. And then she asks
      you to somehow look at her ‘heart’ or something, which no one can really
      see? Shit ain’t right, man. So you see, it’s funny! If she wanted to you
      to see her heart, she could’ve been better served writing some literature
      down on paper. Breaking up with her was the best thing that ever happened
      to you, Enjō.” She returns to lying down on the bed, facing away from me.
      There is a beat of silence before she looks back at me again, her catlike
      eyes staring into me. She starts to open her mouth somewhat pensively, but
      hesitates and looks away, then looks back again before she finally speaks.
      “Well, just so you know there’s no hard feelings, I’ll tell you something
      someone once told me. He said that ‘it’s those unseen, unvoiced things
      that form love. And it isn’t right to give voice to them, or else they
      might turn into lies.’ That’s what he said anyway.” At that, she turns
      away from me again, and I know then that she’s already closed her eyes to
      sleep. With that abrupt end to our conversation, I turn off the lights and
      lie down on the floor to sleep as well, letting the rare silence engulf
      the room and allowing myself to think. I accept that I might have slipped
      up with one girl, but my mind entertains the thought. What if—what if it
      was this girl? Would the same things still apply? Or would she, as she
      always seems inclined to do, just laugh it off and accept it? I come back
      to Ryōgi’s room one night on the second week of my extended stay. I plunge
      the key inside the lock, turn it, and open the door. I walk inside to find
      Ryōgi already sleeping. Though the noise I’m making just stepping into her
      room is probably enough to wake her, she doesn’t. She must be sound
      asleep, or else ascribing my footfalls to a category of acceptable noise
      not worth waking up to. Either way is good. I hold a palm to my cheek,
      still smarting from being hit, as I approach my usual spot on the floor
      and sit down. The clock on the desk beside Ryōgi’s bed ticks the time away
      as the second hand moves to the next mark, and the next, on and on in a
      circle. At the moment, both the minute and hour hand lie at peace pointing
      at twelve. I’ve never liked the analog ones. Staring at them, I always
      feel like I could slowly lose myself in the rotating, spiraling hands. The
      pain from the kicks I received in my leg flares up again, and I utter a
      low grunt of complaint in spite of myself. Ryōgi however, still remains
      unmoving, allowing me to look at her face deep in her deathly, petrified
      sleep. In two weeks of staying in this empty room, one thing always
      arrests my vision. When Ryōgi sleeps, she looks almost like a doll, a
      lifeless thing sleeping atop the bed; so much so that when the sun rises,
      she doesn’t “awaken,” but performs something I liken to an act of
      resurrection, as if life has been breathed into her for another day. At
      first, I thought that she woke up early for school but I soon realized
      that was not the case. It’s always a phone call that gives Ryōgi the
      impetus to actually go out. She waits for it everyday. If no call comes,
      she confines herself here, consumed again by the doll-like languor.
      Needless to say, while I didn’t know the subject of those calls, they were
      no doubt about something dangerous, something that excites Ryōgi enough to
      have the willingness to go outside. The interminable ticking of the clock
      burrows its way deep into my head as I ponder on the simplicity of Ryōgi,
      her beautiful life devoid of any sadness, returning only to a joyous
      vitality when she does whatever it is she needs to do. The perfectly empty
      life without overindulgence, the existence of the “real” that I never
      thought I would find. The sort of Platonic ideal of existence that I
      wanted to become. “Shiki.” The word escapes my lips, more silent than a
      whisper and seeping out like a silent exhalation, and yet, seemingly at
      cue, Ryōgi chooses that exact moment to wake up. A crease forms between
      her eyes as she looks me over. “What the hell happened to you?” she asks.
      Guess she noticed all the bruises on me. “Had no choice,” I sigh. “Two
      guys I didn’t even know tried to jump me, and since they were spoiling for
      a fight, it got messy. Not really good at this whole fighting business, so
      there you go.” “You must have studied something, at least. And yet, you
      still have trouble beating on two guys. What, does getting hurt turn you
      on?” Ryōgi observes wryly as she pushes herself up from the bed. “Don’t
      assume anything. I’ve never taken any sort of class in a martial art.
      Still, if it comes to a fight I can give as good as the next guy.” “Which
      is to say, not much at all. I thought for sure you learned something,
      since I saw you use the palm of your hand to fight when we first met. So
      where’d you learn that?” “I heard somewhere that for someone who wasn’t
      used to it, using your fists would just hurt you as much as you hurt them.
      So it’s better for people like me to just use the palm. Besides, isn’t the
      palm harder? I mean, look at cans. No one punches a can. Everyone crushes
      it with their palm, right? There’s something there, man.” “It’s cause it’s
      easier that way, dumbass,” she says with the usual calmness in her voice.
      This time though, I detect a sense of faint praise from it as well. Her
      eyes are as intense as they ever are, and it makes me break eye contact
      with her from embarrassment. “How about you, Ryōgi? You must have studied
      aikidō or something.” “Just a passing interest in aikidō, actually. I’ve
      only been really serious with one style that I’ve been into ever since I
      was a spoiled brat.” “Since you were a kid? No wonder you could plant a
      roundhouse in the back of a running guy’s head. I’m guessing that’s not
      all there is to your style, though.” Though I only intended it to be a
      casual statement, Ryōgi takes my last sentence to think on seriously.
      “Kind of. It’s sort of a style of my own. The key to it is the mindset.
      You rethink everything about yourself. Your breathing, your footwork, your
      perspective, how you think—even the way you move your muscles changes, and
      it’s almost like becoming someone else. All of it is honed towards taking
      down your enemy as economically as possible. I mean, I suppose all martial
      arts touch on it to some extent, but I guess we…I mean, I took it too
      far.” She spits the last words out as if she hated the entire concept, to
      which I have to react with some amusement. “What’s so bad about that? At
      least you don’t get hit like me, and you get to take out two dudes in two
      seconds. It’s one cool self-made style if you ask me.” Her eyes wander
      away from me, and seem to hint at some heavy disquiet before she replies.
      “Weird thing about that self-made style: I learned it by sort of watching
      someone else do it.” When she immediately plops back down on the bed, I
      get the feeling she doesn’t want to continue the conversation anymore. As
      she goes back to sleep, I’m left to contemplate what exactly her last
      words meant. In a room in a slice of nothingness, dull gray steam rises,
      the hissing sharp enough to pierce the ears. There is a heat here enough
      to make anyone break into sweat in moments. The room is unlit, save for
      the dim orange glow of something burning on an iron plate. All around me,
      there are large canisters lined up one after another, and on the floor, I
      feel countless amounts of narrow tubing brush against my legs. Not a
      single soul can be found in the room. Only the hissing of the billowing
      steam and the useless sound of bubbling water keep each other company. I
      wake up violently to a cold, dead night. A dream. It was a dream. A
      nightmare maybe, different from the usual one. Still, there was little to
      like about it. The second hand on the clock ticks away as if to mock me,
      and when I turn to look at it, I see the time has not even passed 3:00am.
      Still quite a while before I usually wake up. The next thing I notice is
      that the familiar shape of Ryōgi lying on the bed is gone. Must be another
      one of her strolls. She does them every so often. Why they need to be done
      at an ungodly hour when even the fauna sleep is beyond me. I worry about
      her sometimes. Even though she can fight, that doesn’t make it all right
      for her to take a walk so late alone in a city full of people ready to
      take advantage of that. I briefly think about going out to find her, even
      though I know full well that not messing with each other’s private lives
      has become some sort of unspoken rule for me to live here. Ah, fuck it,
      I’ll go. She’s pretty enough that it’s going to be hard for all the thugs
      down in Shinsen to just let her pass by without incident. I rise, and as
      I’m about to open the door to go out into the hallway, the door
      unexpectedly opens with to admit a girl dressed in a familiar kimono and
      leather jacket inside. Ryōgi promptly closes it with as little sound as
      she made opening it. “Hey, you’re home,” I say. She casts her glare
      upwards to look at me. And in that moment, I feel something. She could
      kill me. The lights in the hallway behind her are turned off, and only
      Ryōgi’s eyes shine a frighteningly deep blue in the darkness. My breathing
      is cut off, and for a while, my mind spaces out and I stand stock still
      unable to do anything in that moment of pure dread. “You won’t do either,”
      Ryōgi says, not even trying to hide the consternation in her voice. When
      she speaks, I snap back to normalcy. She brushes past me, taking off her
      jacket and flinging it across the room toward her bed in anger. She takes
      a seat on top of the bed and lazily leans back on the wall behind her,
      offering an upturned head and a blank stare towards the ceiling. Trying to
      ignore the chill that is still running the circuit of my spine, I make an
      awkward about-face from the door and return to the living room to sit down
      in a random spot on the floor. The invisible third inhabitant of this
      room—the unseen and heavy silence that blankets everything— again passes
      between us, as it does so commonly, until she breaks it with her monotone
      words. “I went out to kill.” Unable to form any sort of appropriate
      response to her, I only nod my head to acknowledge what she said. She
      seems to take it as a sign to continue. “Useless. I couldn’t find anyone I
      wanted to kill. When I opened the door and you were there, I thought that
      you could satisfy me for a time, but you couldn’t. Killing you would’ve
      been meaningless.” “I honest to God thought you were going to kill me
      right then and there,” I reply hesitantly but truthfully. “I want to feel
      like I’m alive. But I know a simple murder has no meaning. It’s why I
      drift aimlessly at the late hours, trying to find a reason to live. It’s
      almost like being a ghost. One day…I just know I’m going to kill someone
      for no reason.” The words come out like a conversation thrown toward some
      unseen presence as much as it does a disclosure confided in me, almost
      resembling the torpid speech of a junkie on withdrawal. This is the first
      time I’ve seen her like this. The first time we met was during one of her
      nightly strolls, but she didn’t seem to be spoiling for a fight back then.
      “Get a grip on yourself, Ryōgi. You’ll manage,” I tell her, as I stand up
      and place my hands on her shoulders. Shoulders that seem so unnaturally
      slender for someone as dangerous as her. “I am managing. This is how I do
      it. I got this feeling back in summer too, and that time when—” her speech
      trails off, like she just remembered a memory she’d like to forget. I sit
      back down on the floor, and Ryōgi takes that as a sign to abandon her
      position on the wall and collapse on top of the bed sideways. “Hey,
      Ryōgi,” I probe, not really expecting any further clarification. She’s the
      one that said to me that the heart is unvoiced and unknown to all except
      you, lest it turn into a lie. It’s easy to understand. She’s all alone. I
      was once like that, but at least I had, if not real friends, then just
      people who I could distract myself with so that the problem wouldn’t be so
      obvious. But she doesn’t have that luxury. She had no need of them. “Hey,
      Ryōgi,” I repeat, letting my back rest against the bed so I wouldn’t see
      her. “Do you have any friends?” Some seconds pass to delay her response
      before she speaks again. “Yeah. I think I do.” “Wait, you do?” I say
      incredulously, expecting a completely opposite answer. In contrast, Ryōgi
      just nods calmly. “Then there’s an easy solution! Just go to them and dump
      all your problems on their lap so they help you. It’s the best and easiest
      thing to do in your condition. Even just small talk is usually enough to
      make you forget all about it.” “Well, he’s not here now. He’s out of town,
      doing God knows what.” I fall silent listening to the echo of loneliness
      in her words, but then, as if to say that the spirit of her solitude was
      only something I imagined, she starts to hit the bed violently with her
      clenched fists. “I mean, that guy just barges in here without so much as a
      warning, and how does he return the favor? Oh, nothing except a freaking
      phone number, is all. He even had to take a nappynap in bed for a whole
      month while I took care of business last summer. Why do I have to be
      constantly irritated at him? I mean, what an asshole, right?” The sound of
      her fist hitting a pillow repeats itself, and her voice grows increasingly
      louder with each new sentence of her spontaneous rant. I almost can’t
      believe that Ryōgi is getting this much of a rise from a single question.
      Now the dull thuds turn into sounds of sharp stabbing, almost like Ryōgi
      is piercing the pillow with a knife. I don’t think I really want to know
      exactly what she’s doing so I restrain my curiosity to turn around and
      look. In a little while, the tearing sounds stop and she finally calms
      down. As for me, I kind of become envious at this friend who can raise her
      to such heights of emotion (for her at least), and at the risk of further
      reaction, I decide to ask her about this person. “Say, Ryōgi…” No answer.
      Guess she must still be mad. I pay it no mind and continue. “This friend
      of yours from your school or something? What’s he like?” “Yeah, from high
      school,” Ryōgi responds nonchalantly. “Guy with a name like a poet.” I
      decide not to puzzle out the meaning to that just yet. “So this guy is the
      reason you go out at night, isn’t he?” “Nah. My urge to go out at night
      and kill is just me being me. What’s the matter? You really wanna find out
      what could possibly make me scary enough for you to practically wet
      yourself when I went in?” “What, me, scared? I’m not—” “You’re the one
      that said you thought I was going to kill you.” Her voice is a cold
      sing-song tune that latches itself onto the nape of my neck, tracing a
      chokingly smooth line around it, and for a moment, I am forced to wonder
      if the person lying behind me is truly human. “See? You’re thinking it
      again. But rest easy. It’s the danger that really pumps those pleasure
      chemicals for me, and killing you wouldn’t be so dangerous now, would it?
      Still, it would probably be best for you to find a new place to hide,
      Enjō. In the end, the pleasure I get from murder is going to bite me in
      the ass, and you with it.” Her intonation falls to the volume one expects
      of an act of contrition. Goddamn it. The only thing it does for me is make
      an already distant woman even more distant and inscrutable. I understand
      now; that easily as much as I am terrified of this implacable person— —I
      have fallen for her just as much. “Dumbass. That’s not like you and you
      know it,” I say. “That’s just you being upset. You’ve got two options
      here: mope, or call that friend of yours and go through it together.
      That’s what friends are for, and if you don’t do it, you’ll just cut
      yourself off from socie—” Awkwardly, my words cut off at that point. Like
      Ryōgi a few minutes ago, my mouth was starting to take over my mind and
      spouted the first thing that came to mind. With both of us noting the
      strange pause, I decide to end the conversation. “Well, that’s all I
      wanted to say. Good night, Ryōgi.” I then proceed to lie sprawled on the
      floor, still not permitting myself to look at her. She says something to
      me, but I ignore it as I try to sink into slumber from the embarrassment.
      For tonight at least, I’ve lost all confidence to talk with Ryōgi. It’s a
      pretty simple reason. When I was saying those words, when I don’t even
      have a friend to call my own like Ryōgi does, I felt like the biggest
      hypocritical bastard alive.
