    <p>
      Back when I was a kid, I used to hold on to this little piece of metal all
      the time. It was an ugly little thing, with these dull, jagged teeth that
      started to dig into your skin if you held it tight enough. A lot of times,
      it felt like holding all the loneliness of a cold December day. Still, I
      loved that little thing. I loved the way it made a click every time you
      turned it around, a chime for each day’s beginning and another for its
      end. The sound made me so proud every time I heard it, but it was also
      twinned with something strangely melancholic. But in time, I soon found
      those spiraling days coming to a close. The only thing that remained is
      the silver glint of the metal, and the chill of its surface. There was no
      joy when I held it now, only blood that sometimes oozes when I grip it too
      tight. There wasn’t any sadness either. Maybe there never had been. It’s
      just a simple scrap of metal, nothing more. And when I grew older still,
      even the glint of it—which once seemed so magical—disappeared. It was then
      that it finally hit me: growing up is throwing away fantasy for the
      cunning of survival. And for realizing that, I praised myself for my own
      cleverness. This is the year when autumn went as fast as it came. Having
      just entered the departing days of November, and with winter already well
      underway, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department found another strange
      tale adrift on its shores. To be fair, ghost stories and the like were
      never out of season for the Crime Investigation Section, a trait it
      lovingly shares with hospitals all over the city. It’s practically a
      year-round campfire, huddling together in a dark corner of the human
      experiment to share what new stories the city decided to churn out the
      murder mill. Which is probably why when Detective Akimi, who is as natural
      a police as they come, actually gets interested in a case of his own
      accord, it is a case of some deserved curiosity. Akimi built his career on
      stone whodunits, a man who loved the mystery. Combine this with him
      hearing gossip about a very peculiar report, and you have him phoning the
      relevant stations for the very same report in no time at all. So far
      however, reading the plainly written report held little for him. It told a
      story of a bizarrely failed burglary that took place in some residential
      high-rise a small ways away from downtown in early October. The perp was a
      joe with a previous record, an all too common caper: burgle the apartments
      of people who’d just left it unlocked. Simple, old, but still effective.
      The day of the incident, he stole into just such an apartment after
      staking the place out and waiting for someone to leave, which was probably
      the extent of his planning. What came after was what made this report
      interesting. Apparently, the same guy came running to the nearest police
      station yelling for help. The on-duty officers eventually got a story out
      of his hysteria: that he saw the dead bodies of the family that lived in
      the apartment he broke into. An officer escorted him back to the apartment
      immediately, only to find that the family he spoke of was indeed there. On
      the other hand, they weren’t dead. Instead, they were in quite good health
      and in fact enjoying a family dinner. This understandably disturbed the
      burglar, though the officer really cared only about the fact that the man
      had exposed himself to breaking and entering, and thus, took him into
      custody. Leaning back on his squeaky pipe chair, Detective Akimi offers an
      incredulous “What the fuck?” at the air, directed at no one. The suspect
      tested negative for alcohol or drugs, and didn’t suffer from any glaring
      mental health problems. Certainly a strange and curious report, but
      otherwise, there didn’t seem to be a case here, if it was worthy of even
      being called one. Hardly a case to stand beside the current investigation
      that’s got half the section in a rustle: four missing one after another,
      with no clue as to their whereabouts, and four families that they needed
      to shut up while they worked the case from an angle that benefitted from
      their silence. Much like the serial killings three years ago, it’s
      resulted in many a sleepless night for him, and he certainly didn’t need
      this case to add more. Still, he could feel the hairs on his back rise
      when he read the report, a feeling that he’d learned to trust as the
      instinct that something was there, waiting to be discovered; maybe even a
      report that could be turned into a case with legs to spit shine the
      clearance rate. “Worth a call, at least,” Akimi says as he picks up the
      receiver on his desk phone and puts it to his ear. He dials the number of
      the station where the report came from. Before long, an on-duty officer
      answers and Akimi starts to inquire for details on the report. Did they
      check with the other tenants for anything out of place? Did they find any
      inconsistency with the suspect’s description of the family? But it becomes
      fruitless as the answers fit his expectations, that they had indeed asked
      the neighbors, and no there was nothing out of place, and that the
      description of the perp was spot-on except with regards to the family’s
      state of being. With quick thanks, Akimi puts the receiver back. At that
      instant, a voice calls him from behind. “What are you on the phone for,
      Daisuke? You need to get rolling. The second guy’s body’s just been found,
      and you’re the primary on the case.” “Fuck it, another one? Don’t tell me
      it’s another partially eaten body.” Akimi’s friend only responds with a
      curt nod, which is his cue to drop his curiosity and get out of here. No
      one’s going to care about the report, but it was all tumbleweeds when he
      read it anyway. And nothing takes priority over this new serial murder
      case. With that, the report goes back into file in a cabinet somewhere to
      be forgotten, even by Detective Akimi, the CIS’s lover of mysteries.
