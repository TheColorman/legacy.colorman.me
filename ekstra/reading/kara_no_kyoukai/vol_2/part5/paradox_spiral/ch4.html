    <h1 class="title">Paradox Spiral - IV</h1>
    <p>
      Here, back in the dilapidated back alley where I first met Ryōgi, even the
      buzzing sounds of the city streets turn into nothing more than distant
      echoes coming from everywhere and nowhere at once. I can remember the
      blood here so vividly that I can even recall their bitter smell. But
      they’re gone now, swept up, like everything else, into the alley grime and
      the cold of the late October morning. Even the white puff of air that
      quickly disappears as I exhale is a testament to this phenomenon. From the
      same everywhere and nowhere that the flood of people are located, I single
      out the sound of a clock and its ticking, imagining the hands going round
      and round. It’s now been a month since I threw away my home and my
      livelihood and ran away. And yet, there is still no visible indication
      that the police are after me, or even actively investigating what I did.
      Every day, I pass by the window of a nearby electronics store with a
      display television tuned to the news. I watch diligently, but up till now
      it has not reported anything on the murder I committed. The story is the
      same for the newspapers I can spy or steal from the stands. What I did was
      far more than a simple, random murder. No, it’s the kind of thing that
      journalists can’t resist putting up on the 6:30 news for the public to go
      crazy about, no matter what police embargo they were under. Maybe they
      haven’t found it? No, that can’t be possible. Still, the thought of the
      bodies not being found after a month makes something churn in my stomach
      in a feeling almost like nausea, and engulfs me in a sense of melancholy.
      I briefly entertain the idea of checking to see if they’re still there,
      but pass on it because I don’t have the guts to, and the possibility of
      any five-oh staking the place out to see if I’ll come back. I suppose
      there’s nothing else to do except sit here on the sidelines and wait for
      any sort of sign. Still, at least once…at least once I want to see it on
      television so I can finally have an excuse to disappear from Ryōgi’s life.
      Once the name Tomoe Enjō rings out in society as a the name of a murderer,
      I’ll only cause trouble for Ryōgi, and that’s when I can finally cut what
      little ties we have and make my exit from this wretched city. But maybe
      that’s already too late for me. The clock echoes from its indeterminate
      location, and the wind seems to grow in strength with each recurring tick.
      Following the course of the cold north wind, I walk away from the alley.
      As I exit the maze of back lanes, I notice a familiar figure come into
      view in a far pedestrian crossing. Who else could it be in a kimono and a
      leather jacket except Ryōgi? And yet, even further away from her I manage
      to see another faintly familiar face: one of the guys present on that
      violent night when me and Ryōgi first met. With well-practiced steps, he
      lurks a ways behind Ryōgi, trying not to draw attention to himself. This
      could get bad. I stand there for a moment debating what to do, but the
      ticking of the clock forces me to action. I make my way into and through
      the press of people and stalk the man stalking Ryōgi. It doesn’t take very
      long and far for another of his number to join the man, the same person
      that Ryōgi delivered a roundhouse to. It doesn’t seem like they plan on
      doing anything to her, or they’d have done it already; there were plenty
      of chances for them in the past few minutes to do so away from prying
      eyes. Instead, they seem to be content in keeping watch on her for now.
      Surprisingly enough, they seem organized and rehearsed, with not a single
      step out of place or fumbled. After an hour, the front-and-follow show
      comes to an end with the two breaking off their tail. Curious as to their
      destination, I continue to shadow them as they quicken their pace to head
      into— —the same alley I was in an hour ago. This looks like a trap, but if
      it’s for me or for Ryōgi, and for what purpose, I can’t know. The disquiet
      in me grows. I slip beside the entrance to the alleyway, where the space
      is graduated into a narrow passageway, and stop to listen. I turn my head
      little by little around the corner to sneak a glance at what the two could
      be doing. As my vision pans over to what little I can see inside, I freeze
      at what I see. A man in a vivid wine-red long coat, whose silhouette tells
      of long, tall, and slender features, stands in the middle of the alleyway.
      His hair is a long, blonde fall from head to back. Even from this
      distance, I can see the condescending, almost pitying expression on his
      face as he opens his mouth to speak. “■■■■■■――――――――” He speaks in a
      language that echoes out in power, and magic, and ambition. And though I
      don’t understand it, I somehow understand the fluency with which he wields
      it. I feel someone’s presence behind me and quickly turn to meet whoever
      it was, but find no one there. I swing my head back to look at the
      alleyway, but in that small span of an instant that could not have been
      more than a second, the man had vanished. The north wind blows through the
      alleyway, passing through me, seemingly more frigid now than before. I
      shiver in spite of myself, and hold my arms close to my body. The shiver
      starts to intensify uncontrollably, and for no particular reason, an urge
      to cry takes over me, and I barely resist it. In that urge, I feel in my
      skin a tremble of entropy, the end of an autumn, and in my bare face I
      feel the very end of me. When night falls and me and Ryōgi are back at her
      room, I tell her all about what happened this morning. As usual, however,
      her reply is concise to the point of unhelpfulness. “Really?” She draws
      the word out with a barely suppressed yawn. “And?” “Don’t fucking ‘and?”
      me! Those guys weren’t the only one watching you. Do you remember seeing
      any foreign dude with a red long coat?” “Hmm, guy sounds like a ball to
      hang out with. But no, I don’t.” She quickly loses her interest in the
      conversation, just as she always does in anything she deems of no real or
      immediate consequence. I have a feeling that even if you falsely accuse
      her of murder, she’ll pay it no real heed. To her, the weight of external
      events is far less important than her own feelings. Sometimes, I almost
      feel like I want to emulate that state of mind, but this was a moment of
      exception. That man was as real as anything I’ve ever seen, containing
      something like a purity similar to Shiki Ryōgi, and beyond my reach. “Can
      you just listen for one second to what I’m saying? It’s not like this is
      someone else’s problem. It’s yours!” My yelling somehow gets Ryōgi to prop
      herself up on the bed and sit atop it with crossed legs. She looked at me
      as I tried my hardest to show a stern face. After staring each other down
      for a brief moment, she speaks. “Alright, I get it, it’s a problem. What I
      don’t get is why you’re so worked up about this, Enjō.” “I worry because
      you’re an idiot and wouldn’t know better.” A brief pause. “I don’t want
      you to get hurt or anything.” A gulp, a moment’s glance away from her, and
      then, “because I love you, goddamit.” The bickering atmosphere seemed to
      evaporate in an instant. There, I said it. The word that should never be.
      Even though I promised not to say it on account of me leaving eventually.
      Ryōgi, for her part, looks at me with cocked brow, as if observing some
      quaint curiosity. Several seconds pass in this way until she finally…
      …bursts out laughing. Her first laugh was so sudden that she would have
      spitted out milk if she had any in her mouth. “What—” She tries to stop
      herself from laughing but can’t. “What the hell, Enjō? Shit ain’t right,
      man. You’re not in love with me. You’re just—” Another fit of boisterous
      laughter. “You’ve just been hypnotized or something by that guy in a red
      coat. Take a flashback, I’m sure you’ll remember a pendulum dangling in
      front of you!” So even this is a matter to laugh off. Her disbelief only
      agitates me further. “No, it’s the god’s honest truth! When I saw you, it
      was the first time I saw anyone so real, and someone so like me. But
      you—you’re not fake like everyone else. I’d do anything for you to believe
      me.” I draw closer to Ryōgi and put my hands atop her shoulders. That
      reduces her laughter to a giggle, and finally stops it altogether. I see
      her shift her eyes to look at my arm, and then back at me. “I see,” she
      says dryly. Suddenly, she grasps my shirt collar with blinding speed. With
      one smooth movement, she throws me like paper over and atop the bed,
      leaving me looking upwards with her face looming close above mine as she
      lies on top of me. I have no idea when she had the time to produce the
      knife that she is now holding in her free hand. “Then will you die for
      me?” I feel the tip of the blade prick my neck ever so lightly, and see
      Ryōgi’s eyes narrow into a sinister glint. I know at that moment that her
      question isn’t whether I would die doing something for her, but if I would
      allow her to kill me for her own pleasure, nonchalant and indifferent as
      she always is. The only way she can show any real affection. I’m scared,
      so scared of death that my body is paralyzed by it. And yet, I don’t have
      long for this world anyway. One day, the police are going to come
      knocking, and then there’ll be no going back. And it is with that
      consideration that I say: “Yeah. I’d gladly die for you.” There is the
      tiniest shift, the smallest movement on Ryōgi’s brow, and it lets me know
      that I said something she didn’t expect, and for a moment, she hesitated,
      and her eyes slightly return to familiarity. “Do it. Kill me. It’s not
      going to be long now anyway. I killed my parents, and that means the death
      penalty. I’d rather have you kill me than the law and a noose.” “You’re a
      parricide?” I can still feel the knife tip keenly on my neck, but the
      strength behind its grip has ebbed noticeably. There, before I die, I
      decide to lay bare the horrible memory that haunts me, just to convince
      myself I took my one last opportunity at penance. “Yeah, killed both of
      them. They were no good—kept racking up debts that I didn’t know about and
      wasting all of the money. Had enough dealing with their bullshit, so I
      took a kitchen knife to their guts and stabbed them over and over, to make
      sure I didn’t make any mistake. That night was cold as hell, but those
      organs and intestines…they were all so warm. Like you could feel the heat
      going up from their spilled guts and it wrapped all over you. It almost
      made me go numb and crazy. My fingers wouldn’t let go of the knife, and my
      arm just kept going up and down, up and down by itself. You couldn’t tell
      whether I took a knife to them to kill, or if I just wanted to go crazy
      and mix up some human insides; you couldn’t even tell whether a person
      killed them, or an animal.” I think that it would only be appropriate for
      me to break down in tears now, but the tears won’t come. Instead, I feel a
      strange sort of relief, as if killing my parents truly did make me find
      freedom. “Tomoe, why did you kill them?” Her voice hangs on the border
      between inquisitiveness and pity as she asks the question I know would
      come. What was the answer, then? Was it because I hated them? Because they
      were more trouble than they were worth? Only lies I whisper in silent
      nights to salve the memory. The truth, the real reason is, “I was
      scared…of a dream. A dream where I come home from my job late at night and
      lie down on my bed. I can hear the shouting match between my mom and dad
      from the other side of the door, but the noise stops. Soon after, the door
      opens, my mother standing in the doorway, and beyond her, my dad covered
      in blood and lying dead. Then my mother kneels down on top of me, brings
      up a knife to stab me over and over before she slits her own throat. The
      dream is so real, I thought I’d really died. But morning came and I woke
      up just the same. That’s supposed to be the end of it, right? Just my
      desire to kill my parents manifesting itself one night, right? But when I
      started to see it every single fucking night, every time waking up
      breathing hard, almost screaming, I couldn’t stand it. I was scared of
      that fictional night where the dream would come alive. And one night, I
      decided I couldn’t stand to experience it one more night, and I broke. So
      I killed them, before they could kill me.” I remember that night as
      clearly as a happy memory. I’d hid the kitchen knife beside the mattress,
      and when mom opened the door for some reason or another, I charged her,
      knife out and straight towards her chest. I stabbed her over and over, as
      if to make up for all the times I had been stabbed myself in my dreams.
      And with that, I was free from my useless folks, free from that ominous
      dream, with nothing to tie me down. A dirty, bloodstained freedom. “You’re
      one goddamned idiot, you know that?” says Ryōgi frankly, with a lack of
      restraint that snaps me out of my reverie. She’s right, more resoundingly
      and more profoundly than probably even she knows. I’m one hell of an idiot
      to have not thought of any other way out of my situation except to kill my
      own parents. But even now, I don’t regret it for a second. I’d sooner be
      caught by the police and be put behind bars than to have endured another
      day of my former life. But I did realize one thing when I was explaining
      my crime to Ryōgi: how can a boy who has only ever looked out and cared
      for himself start to care about a stranger like Ryōgi? It seems like some
      sort of fallacy, a lingering paradox, an act to which I do not have any
      right to perform. Knowing this, it’s probably no mystery why she just
      laughed off my proposal. But that doesn’t sway my love for her, the one
      thought that I find in me to be truly real, if still regrettably tainted
      by my sin. When I realize this, the fever of passion that had seized me
      minutes ago began to subside. But even in this paradox, I still consider
      the murder a necessary action, and for me there are no regrets. Ryōgi’s
      eyes hanging above me are distant and unclouded as they stare into me,
      studying every quiver of the lip shaped by spoken words and every crease
      and line formed on my face from unspoken emotion. “You misunderstood your
      choices. If your parents were like that, and you’ve lasted until now, then
      you could have borne that pain a bit more, like you always did; chosen the
      easier way. But in the end, you had to make it harder for yourself. When I
      first met you, I thought you were trying to deny who you were. You were
      empty. So here’s the question: did you change since that night? Or do you
      want to die now just as much as you wanted to then?” asks the girl who
      would kill me on a whim, the girl I had surrendered my life to. She is
      right again. Another contradiction. I tried to cast my life away on that
      night, thinking it alright to murder someone in a deserted alley, but also
      thinking it wouldn’t be so bad for the same thing to happen to me. Just
      continuing to exist aimlessly, like a wind-up doll conducting some bad
      facsimile of humanity, seemed like a burden with each step. And yet, I
      didn’t want to die, didn’t even want to kill myself. That cruel paradox
      seized me as if to tear me apart, and the same thing is occurring now:
      facing Ryōgi now with my sins bare before her, and still not completely
      embracing the death that is staring into my face, even though I know life
      is just a slow slide to the eventual end. My end will just be a little
      earlier, a little stupider, and a little more worthless than other people.
      It’s the worthlessness that I can’t seem to bear. If that’s the way it’s
      going to go, then… “…dying by your hand would be more worthwhile, more
      real.” “Maybe, maybe not. The only thing I know is that you’re not dying
      tonight. Not because of me, anyway. I don’t need to take your life.” Ryōgi
      lifts the knife away from my throat, and then puts it away. Like a cat
      losing interest in a toy, she gets up from the bed and walks away from me,
      retrieving her jacket from the coat rack as she does so. Looks like she’s
      about to go out somewhere. I can’t stand to look at her anymore. “Tell me,
      Enjō. Where’s home for you?” Ryōgi’s voice reverts to the coldness I
      recognize since the first night we met. Funny question to ask. Me and my
      folks kept moving, never staying for more than half a year in any one
      place; I assume either because of the unpaid rents, or the collection
      agencies would come knocking. Ever since that started happening, I’ve
      hated the setup and wanted a real, normal house. Like the one we had when
      I was a kid. “A dump called unit 405 in an apartment somewhere. Why are
      you asking?” “That isn’t what I asked. I’m asking about the place you
      really want to go back to. Well, if you don’t know, can’t say I didn’t
      expect it.” Ryōgi opens the door leading outside, and without turning to
      face me, she says, “Ciao, Enjō. Come by any time you feel the need.” She
      goes out the door, and with a turn, she disappears from view, seemingly
      taking all of the color of the room with her, leaving everything with an
      air of dreariness. For several minutes, my rust-tainted soul looks over
      the room where I’d spent the last month of my life, before I decide to
      depart and separate myself from the dull monochrome.
