    <p>
      That which is discordant. <br />
      That which is hated. <br />
      That which is intolerable. <br />
      Accept these things and all others, and never know pain. <br /><br />
      That which is harmonious. <br />
      That which is desired. <br />
      That which is permitted. <br />
      Reject these things and all others, and know nothing but pain.
      <br /><br />
      One affirms, one denies. <br />
      Between two hearts lies the hollow. <br />
      Between two minds lies emptiness. <br />
      Between two souls, I reside.
