    <p>
      The miracle of Shiki’s recovery happened only a scant few days after that.
      According to the new hire, Shiki’s parents had not even been allowed to
      talk to her for some reason, which meant that visits from him would be
      decidedly impossible. Because of this, the boy seemed to dive into the
      paperwork a little more readily, a little more fervently than Tōko had yet
      seen, perhaps as some means to distract himself. “It really is far too
      dark in this office,” Tōko mentions, to break the silence they had kept
      since the start of the day. “Well, I could get a light for you, if you
      want, ma’am,” he replies, monotone, without sparing even a glance to Tōko.
      She got the sense that he was thinking of something with the kind of anal
      diligence that were allowed only to absurd thoughts; half-baked ideas that
      one leaves to linger in the mind long enough to entertain the notion that
      they might actually be halfway sane. With this in mind, Tōko finally spoke
      to him frankly. “You’re free to stop looking so glum about it anytime, you
      know. Shiki, I mean. And don’t even think about sneaking in there at night
      just to see her.” “I’m not thinking anything of the sort, ma’am. Besides,
      there’re far too many guards around that place: a pair in the front door,
      and a handful patrolling the grounds.” Mercy me, thinks Tōko, incredulous,
      he’s already counted the guards and patrol routes. I just took him under
      my wing, so far be it from me to allow him to be a criminal overnight.
      With a shrug of resignation, Tōko spoke. “I was going to play this one
      close to the chest, but you’re leaving me without much choice here. I’ve
      pulled what strings and favors I can to get hired as a temp therapist in
      the hospital where your friend is. You hear that? I’m going to find out
      about Shiki Ryōgi for you, so don’t you go running off doing something
      that’ll get you arrested. It’s the least I could do after hearing you tell
      that story when you didn’t want to in the first place.” She sighed in what
      might have been an attempt to place a last bit of indifference to the
      whole situation. The boy, however, stood up, walked towards Tōko, and
      grasping each of her hands with one of his, he shook them up and down. Not
      realizing this was his way of expressing his gratitude, she gave him an
      awkward look, saying, “Right—weird. Gotcha.” “This is so surprising, Miss
      Tōko! I didn’t think you’d have it in you to possess the compassion of the
      average person, ma’am!” “Now see, you could’ve taken this in quiet
      celebration. But instead, you had to go and destroy your chances of ever
      having a raise.” “Oh, sorry, slip of the tongue,” he says quickly, trying
      to gloss over it as fast as possible. “So that’s why you’re wearing a
      fancy suit today. Yes, quite stylish. It looks so good, I almost don’t
      recognize you.” “Um, well I always dress this way, but fine, feel free to
      keep up the compliments. Lord knows I don’t get enough of them.” Sensing
      that the boy would barrel right on through whatever she said, Tōko quickly
      tried to get back on track. “So, with that business out of the way, I
      expect you not to do anything as stupid as your age might imply.
      Something’s not right with that hospital, and I’m not sure what, but you
      don’t need to get involved in it. You just stay here and do some
      crosswords or something while I’m out.” Those last sentences put a damper
      on the boy’s otherwise infectious enthusiasm, and when he finally calmed
      down, he asked, “What do you mean something’s not right?” “I can feel the
      resonance of magic there, a ward maybe, put up by a mage other than me.
      Whoever it is, his or her objective probably isn’t Shiki, or they wouldn’t
      have waited so courteously for two years for me to pop into the picture.”
      A lie and Tōko knew it. The machinations of mages were often marked by
      their forethought and patience, and there wouldn’t have been a reason for
      any mage to act before Shiki awakened, but now she has. The boy need not
      know all of that, and fortunately, it seemed that Tōko bluffed it well
      enough for him to be satisfied. “Um, ma’am, when you say a ‘ward’, you
      mean something like what you’ve set up on this building, right?” “You got
      the gist of it. Wards are nifty little spells centering around controlling
      a slice of space. Some mages like to conjure up actual physical walls, but
      others are a bit more subtle, veiling a place to induce a mental urging on
      anyone that doesn’t know or have business with the mage to go away. Best
      part? People never notice it. To them, it’s just some gut feeling that
      they should stay away. The perfect spell to hide the fact that this place
      is the sanctum of the best mage this side of Tokyo,” she said with a
      flutter of her hand, the boy reading no irony into what she said. “Of
      course, you managed to get through and find me and I didn’t even know you.
      But hey, that’s why I hired you, didn’t I?” “Then is the ward in the
      hospital a dangerous spell or something?” “Read between the lines, friend.
      Wards are rather benign as spells go—by themselves anyway. It’s always
      been used to protect hallowed ground from the prying eyes of the outside
      world. It originated from Buddhist thought, as far as I know, but now it
      refers to spells that act as an occultation to the mage, making him or her
      extremely difficult to find. Good ones don’t get noticed. The best ones
      just go out-and-out creating a small demarcated space that’s removed from
      all normal perceptions of ‘space’, essentially a small, temporary—yet
      functioning—pocket universe. But that’s some straight up high-level
      thaumaturgy, done only by archmages; though as far as I know, there’s only
      one such individual in Japan.” Now that Tōko was talking about the Art, a
      subject she rarely tackled in the presence of the boy, she took on a
      pointed countenance that looked even more serious than her usual
      expression. Being a mage was her other job—her real job, if one could even
      call it that. She continued: “Still, while it may not have been that
      extreme, that ward in the hospital is still very well woven, whatever
      effects it may have. I almost didn’t notice it at first. I knew someone
      once that could have worked something like it, but it really could have
      been anyone deft enough in that aspect of the Art. I guess it fits their
      specialty, but mages who specialize in wards do tend to distance
      themselves from most outside affairs, so I can’t imagine someone like that
      meddling in this.” That ward in the hospital wasn’t just some cheap spell
      from an amateur, though, thought Tōko. It was different, pointed inward
      maybe. Maybe to veil the hospital from any unwanted attention? The mental
      urging telling those inside to ignore anything abnormal, so someone could
      operate with free rein? Tōko told none of this to the boy. He still needed
      to be kept out of any unnecessary meddling from things beyond his ken. She
      mentioned only enough to be polite, and make it clear to him that this was
      a matter far above him. Tōko took one glance at the wall clock and stood
      up. “Well, guess it’s about time I showed my face over there,” she said,
      and started to walk towards the door. “Miss Tōko, please just take care of
      Shiki for me,” the boy says behind her. Without turning to look at him,
      she gave him a grunt of acknowledgement and waved a hand in goodbye, but a
      last question from the boy gave her reason to hold her steps for a moment.
      “Oh, just a trivial question, ma’am, but who was that expert in wards that
      you knew?” She dug into her memory for a moment, then looked over her
      shoulder and answered. “Oh, just an old friend. A monk. There’s really no
      need to worry about him. The last time we met was on long-past times, in
      different continents.” It has been six days since Tōko first filled in as
      a speech therapist for Shiki’s case. She had just come back to the office
      from the hospital, and she was about ready to just sit down and relax
      until the day ran out. She looked out the window, the setting sun outside
      baking the walls of her unlit office into a crisp red, forcing her to
      slacken her orange necktie; a sign of the coming summer heat. Each evening
      she returned to the office with an update on Shiki’s progress, an act the
      boy learned to be thankful for. “She does PT two times a day, and a
      battery of brain examinations after that, and both leave her pretty spent.
      You don’t need to be troubling her further by going there, so have the
      patience to wait a little longer and you’ll be able to see her then.”
      “Will she be fine with just two physical therapy sessions a day? I mean,
      she was in a coma for two years after all.” “I’ve heard that they
      exercised her joints everyday while she was in a coma. These are trained
      professionals, friend. Trust them to do their job. Hers is a
      ‘rehabilitation’ in more than one sense, as she needs to realign herself
      with society as well. How she recovers physically is only a question of
      time.” Tōko paused to produce a cigarette, promptly putting it into her
      mouth and lighting it. Shiki Ryōgi, was, to her, an enigma, a puzzle to
      relish the formulation of a solution. And every time she talked to Shiki,
      every time she came back to the office to tell the boy, she found herself
      pondering the greatest puzzle of all: Shiki’s identity. “Her mind,
      however…well, that’s an entirely different story. She’s drifting farther
      apart from her previous self each day, I suspect.” “It’s the amnesia,
      isn’t it?” the boy said hesitantly, but also with conviction, as if he’d
      been preparing himself for this revelation for the past two years. “I’m
      not entirely convinced it is. I don’t see anything wrong with her
      personality. It’s just that...well, I don’t know how you’ll react to this
      so—” “Don’t worry, ma’am. I think you’ve inured me to these things by now.
      Please, spare no detail on my account. What exactly is wrong with her?”
      Ironic, then, that sparing details was exactly what she had been doing in
      the last few days. But, she thought, perhaps it’s best that he know now.
      “Her other half that you told me about, the other personality known as
      Shiki she kept inside her, has vanished. She probably can’t even be sure
      herself whether she’s or Shiki. When she awoke, Shiki was already gone.
      And maybe, that’s why her soul now feels empty, like a sinkhole. We mages
      know better than most the consequences of the soul, and the hollow she
      feels now is a hell of a burden, inexpressible but keenly felt.” “But, why
      did Shiki disappear?” he inquired calmly. All told, he’s taking this quite
      well, thought Tōko. Maybe he really has steeled himself for it. “I’m only
      speculating here, but if you’ll entertain it: Two years ago in that
      accident, the girl you know as Ryōgi died. But Shiki took her place and
      died in her stead. ‘Reborn’, such as it was, in her mind was a wholly new
      individual, molded by her memories and experience but unable to truly feel
      them. She still probably spends her nights there in her dilemma, unable to
      grasp the sensation that she is someone that is more than the sum of her
      parts.” “If she’s a different individual like you said, does that mean she
      can’t remember anything that happened before?” “No, no, she remembers just
      fine, with the exception of the memories that Shiki himself made. She
      suffered what might be called a ‘death of the mind’. Think of it as her
      taking a little trip and gaining new experiences. She’s still the Shiki
      you know, but changed somehow by the journey of her soul. I suspect that’s
      why her growth stopped when she slipped into the coma, as she entered a
      liminal state of being alive and dead, due to the dual existences of and
      Shiki: a paradox that reality couldn’t resolve. Her memories will be a
      source of continued anxiety, I assure you, as she will be unable to
      remember many of what made her dual existence unique, and what she does
      remember she can’t process as her own. Her personality is one of
      synthesis, of the past and the present mixed together.” I make it sound
      like it happened involuntarily, Tōko thought, but it probably wasn’t; to
      compensate for the one she lost, as a way to retain her identity as a
      Ryōgi, she changes herself. If that’s true, then she’s a fool. She needs
      companionship, not mimesis, to fill the hollow that Shiki left behind,
      even if she doesn’t know it yet. Tōko let this remain unsaid, and
      continued. “But even if we hypothesize that she’s a different person, the
      truth is that she’s still Shiki Ryōgi, even if she can’t feel the same
      way. Time will pass, and with time, her soul’s wounds will heal, and
      she’ll eventually recognize that fact. A rose by any other name and all
      that jazz. See, a rose doesn’t change just because you put it on different
      soil or water it another way. So don’t start slashing your wrists in the
      bathroom because of it.” She added in a whisper, “In the end, a hole has
      to be filled with something. For her, the memories won’t do. She needs to
      make new memories, new experiences; a new hallow for her soul that she
      herself can create.” Tōko looked squarely at the boy, ensuring there was
      no mistaking who she was referring to. “And it’s your job to get her
      there. You just go do your thing, make contact and conversation. It’s the
      thing she needs the most after she gets out of the hospital, which should
      be soon.” She chucks the cigarette she had been smoking violently out the
      window, and then raised her arms to stretch her back, the bones producing
      a satisfying cracking sound. “I really shouldn’t have bought a brand of
      smokes I don’t know. That was a horrible smoke right there,” she said to
      no one in particular. The boy couldn’t figure out if the long sigh she
      made afterwards was caused by her hatred of the cigarette or of the
      difficulty of her job, and decided that it was perhaps best not to ask. As
      my usual morning examination comes to its usual boring close, I glance at
      the desk calendar beside my bed and realize it’s the 20th of June. That
      makes the duration of my stay here a mere seven days, counting tomorrow
      when I get out of the hospital. With the gradual recovery of my body, they
      saw fit to finally cut me loose. And that includes the bandages on my
      eyes, which will come off early tomorrow morning. It’s amazing how little
      of importance you can gain, and how much you can lose in as short as a
      week’s time. Akitaka and my parents probably haven’t changed a bit, but
      they feel like strangers. But it’s me that’s changed, and with it,
      everything. I can only lie here and watch as it happens. I let my hand
      brush lightly over the bandages covering my eyes. For all that I lost,
      this is the only thing I gained. Death: Maybe it’s a time and a place. But
      it’s also a concept, formless and shapeless. I lived through it, and now I
      can literally see it. When I opened my eyes for the first time in two
      years, the first thing I took notice of wasn’t the nurse who rushed to my
      side in astonishment. It was a line, running across her throat. It only
      took a moment for me to see the rest: a line in every person, in every
      wall, even in the air itself, all of them across everything I could see.
      They were never still, always flowing and slithering in accursed serenity.
      Then I realized that these weren’t just lines. They were cracks and
      fissures to that oblivion of nothingness I had been in. I was filled with
      an irrational fear then, a fear of the possibility of that outer darkness
      pouring into the world I had just returned to. The nurse talked to me, but
      I couldn’t hear the words, only seeing the lines, and the things they were
      attached to crumbling and dying, breaking apart piece by piece. It was
      that vision that provided the impetus for me to try destroying my eyes. My
      arms moved, half through my own volition, half through instinctual fear,
      and every muscle hurt like hell. I was still weak, and because of that the
      doctor was able to stop me from crushing my own eyes. Jury’s still out on
      whether that was a good thing or not. They never seriously asked me why I
      did it, chalking it up to the fact that my mind was still recovering, and
      all sorts of involuntary impulses could happen then. But now my eyes are
      almost good again, a fact that I couldn’t deny any longer. I’d do anything
      not to see a world like that a second time. Neither the world I’m in now,
      or the world of “ ” in my sleep, a place more disgusting and repulsive
      than any place I’d ever seen. I still can’t bear the thought of ever
      returning there, though I’ve since consigned it to a bad dream. Yet these
      eyes tied to that oblivion are proof enough of how real it was. I point my
      fingertips at my eyes. They’re only inches away from each other now. All
      that’s left for me to do now is make a fast, clean stab, like I always did
      in sword practice— “Hold that thought, friend. Never been told to look
      before you leap? Whoops, poor choice of words.” From the door comes a
      woman’s voice. I turn my head towards it. I didn’t have time to remember
      who she is exactly but whoever she is, I can hear her voice coming closer.
      I don’t seem to hear any accompanying footfalls, however. The person stops
      right beside my bed. “Arcane Eyes of Death Perception, huh? Destroying
      that’d be a huge waste, Shiki. In the first place, even if you destroy it,
      reality will still make you see what you were meant to see. Curses come
      home to roost too.” “Who the hell are you?” I ask. I hear the sound of her
      trying to stifle laughter at my angered inquiry, and a rough click, like a
      lighter spitting out flame. “A mage. One you’d do well to listen to. Those
      Eyes are a tool, and like any tool, you need someone to teach you how to
      use it.” As she speaks, I slowly recognize her voice. The tone is altered
      somewhat, but it is definitely that speech therapist, here for our daily
      sessions. “How to use—” “Damn right. Better than not knowing anything and
      fucking everything up right? You have eyes capable of manifesting death,
      Arcane power the likes of which the Celtic god Balor held.” What. The.
      Hell. I have absolutely no idea what this woman is saying. “Arcane Eyes
      usually only become permanent through a ritual performed on the eyes, but
      you, you’ve had them ever since, didn’t you? Your little brush with death
      was just the kind of thing that would have awakened it. From what I hear
      from reliable sources, it was always your nature.” I know what she’s
      saying, and my memories say the same thing. was always one to look past
      appearances, and always read a person’s character, though she never truly
      intended to do so. I couldn’t possibly begin to speculate as to how she
      could have known about that, but she continues to talk like she knows
      every bit about me. “That was the way rolled, and I suggest you start
      doing it more often too. Understand that everything has a flaw, a
      fundamental lie. Then, understand that everything is driven to entropy, to
      be pulled into chaos and break down. You’ve been brushing that boundary of
      death for so long that you’ve been able to comprehend it, your eyes
      allowing you to observe these flaws like a microscope would, seeing lines
      no one else can see. What you’re seeing is a thing’s death, its end, and
      you can touch and mold it with your will. Practically speaking, there’s
      not much difference between you and old Balor now, is there? If you really
      feel like putting extra finger-shaped holes in your Eyes, then you can
      sell them to me instead, and I’ll happily extract them from you for
      study.” “Well, you said I’ll still see them even if I do, so I don’t see
      why I should hand them ove—“ “Then you do listen to people after all. Then
      hear this: the mundane life? Ain’t gonna happen. And quit your bitching
      already. End of the line for your dream. Wake up! Open your eyes to my
      world, the secret world. You were meant to be here. The happiness of the
      everyday isn’t for you.” Her declaration carries a confidence that rides
      with finality, and it’s a sudden and unexpected conclusion that my mind
      still refuses to accept. “But…I don’t even have the will to live anymore.”
      I manage to utter. A weak reply, but it’s all I can bring to fore. “Oh,
      let me guess, because your soul is hollow?” she says in a mocking tone.
      “And yet you don’t want to die. You know why? Because you’ve seen that
      supernal realm that no third-rate Kabbalist can even begin to conceive of,
      you ungrateful little brat. Look, I’ll break down your existential crisis
      for you. You were inseparable once, but now that’s no longer true. Shiki’s
      gone. Big whoop. You’re a different person now. You mutter that you don’t
      have the will to live while you entertain the thought of not dying. You
      say you have no reason to be alive, yet you’re scared of death. You’re a
      regular Neville Chamberlain aren’t you, sitting on that boundary. Is it
      still a wonder why your soul is so hollow?” “How dare you even talk about
      me like you know me! I don’t—” When I finally find the strength to
      protest, I am cut off again, not by her, but by me…seeing her silhouette
      through the bandages…as well as the lines she spoke of. Death itself
      twines around my fingers. “Guessing you saw the lines again, judging from
      your reaction. You let your guard down too easily, is why. The stray
      wraiths in this hospital are happy to have you. You don’t get your shit
      together soon, they’ll have a comfortable new home in your body.” She must
      be talking about the white haze. But I haven’t seen it around lately. “Oh,
      they’re going to get friendly with you. They’re ghosts, you know, parts of
      the soul fettered to this side, something keeping them from passing on.
      They aren’t sentient, least not like us, but they’re instinctual things
      driven to return to corporeality. This hospital has a lot of them.
      Practitioners of the spiritual Arts usually protect themselves from being
      possessed when dealing with ghosts, but to someone with as hollow insides
      such as yours, it’s as easy as stealing a car.” She says it with such
      contempt that she almost seems to be enjoying the entire affair. If all of
      that was true, why did it not possess me in the past? I’d never offered
      any resistance, after all. “You’re pathetic, and make a mockery of the
      rune ward I put extra effort into casting here to protect you. I guess
      we’re not seeing eye to eye here. All right, you can go do…whatever it is
      you do from now on for all I care.” After she spits out those words, I
      hear her stand up and make for the door, but before she closes it to
      leave, she leaves me one last question. “But are you really going to waste
      what Shiki sacrificed himself for, Ryōgi?” As it has become with the
      questions she liked to bring up about my past, I could not produce an
      answer, and my evasion only makes me feel like there was something I
      missed, something I still couldn’t find the reason for. Night has fallen
      and darkness has crept into my room. This evening, no footsteps can be
      heard in the corridor outside, and the silence is kept as dutifully as in
      a deep mountain. In my head, I keep replaying my conversation with the
      therapist, specifically her parting words. Why did you take ’ place,
      Shiki? The question echoes in my head, but Shiki isn’t there to answer.
      Why did you disappear? What could you have possibly gained in return? You
      always liked to dream, always liked to sleep, and yet, on that rain-soaked
      night, you threw that away and died. You’re the me I can never meet, who I
      never could meet. I slowly fall into sleep, racking my mind for a memory,
      any single scene that could explain why he did what he did. As always, no
      luck. The door to my room makes a low creak: someone is opening it. Slow,
      heavy-set footsteps draw closer. The nurse maybe? No, it’s already past
      midnight. A visitor? But who could possibly come at this late an— A hand
      wraps itself lovingly around my neck, cold to the touch. In an instant,
      strength enters it, squeezing, choking, and my neck begins to be crushed,
      little by little. With a moment’s pressure, Shiki breathes a single
      moment’s pained gasp. She can feel the air in her throat slowly being cut
      off as the fingers tighten their caress. Shiki can only wryly observe. At
      the rate this guy is going, my neck’s gonna be crushed before I have the
      air wrung out of me. Though unable to see, Shiki attempts to offer her
      attacker a solid look directly to the face, so close that she can smell
      the scent of…it. Whatever this thing is, it isn’t something that is still
      alive, judging by the smell. Shiki can feel it now, the corpse looming
      above her, its grip not slacking for even a second. She grasps both arms,
      attempting to ward them off, but to no avail—the difference in strength
      was clear. But wait, thinks Shiki, isn’t this what I’d wanted all along?
      She stops resisting, and halts her breathing. If I’m going to choose to
      die, might as well make it as fast as humanly possible. After all,
      existing without really “living” is the worst thing you can do to anyone.
      It’s only right for me to disappear. Her strength ebbs as she surrenders
      herself. Though only a few seconds have passed, to Shiki, times seems to
      be stretching itself out painfully. Cold, wooden hands dig into her skin.
      The flesh tears, and warm blood seeps forth as proof of life. I’m going to
      die, just like Shiki. And I’m just going to throw that life away, like
      trash. The thought makes Shiki pause. Did Shiki really want to die? I
      never thought about that. Of course he never wanted to die! But—he had to.
      To protect something. And he wouldn’t have wanted me to die too. After
      all, death is such a lonely, fruitless thing; dark, ominous, and more
      worthy of fear than anything else. “No!” Shiki manages to cough. In a
      moment, she resumes her resistance, grabbing hold of both arms as before,
      and puts a foot on her attacker’s belly. “Anything but to fall into that
      place again!” And with all the strength she could manage on that one leg,
      she kicks the corpse upwards and away. The blood and skin on Shiki’s
      throat make a wet sound as the hands that held her slip away. Immediately,
      she stands up and gets herself away from the bed as fast as her feet could
      carry her, but the corpse is close behind. Its hands struggle in the unlit
      room, trying to find solid purchase on Shiki’s body as he tries to grapple
      her again. From what Shiki can tell, the corpse’s body is that of an adult
      man, two heads higher than her. She fumbles as best as her blindness can
      allow, but she is hard pressed to resist, her hands being as busy trying
      to feel herself around the room as warding off the corpse’s attacks. She
      retreats, and retreats once more, until she leads herself back-first into
      a wall. The light bump on her back reassures her: it is a hard rap on the
      glass window. The corpse approaches, and Shiki hears the sound of its arms
      cutting through the air, which Shiki manages to intercept with her own,
      stopping them at least for a while. With the window at her back and the
      corpse in place, all was according to her hastily thought up plan. There
      is one last consideration that gives her a moment’s hesitation—what floor
      is this on? “Don’t hesitate!” she tells herself, and releases the arms of
      the corpse as hard as she could manage. Immediately, they gun for her
      throat again, but Shiki is faster. Using her now free hands, she opens the
      window. With the force of the corpse’s grapple and approach, they both
      fall out of the window, entangled with each other. In an instant, me and
      the corpse are out of the window and in open air. In the next instant, I
      grab it by the shoulder and force it downwards, reversing our positions.
      With him below me to soften my fall, we descend together. A second or two
      later, it hits the ground, and I feel the force of the impact sharply but
      without lasting pain. I jump away from it, the hands and feet that support
      my landing scattering some dirt in the hospital’s yard. Judging from the
      sound of foliage just before the fall, the corpse had fallen on some sort
      of flower bed a meter or so away. That was an amazing landing, if I do say
      so myself. So amazing in fact, that my body is frozen in place, likely
      still catching up at having just fallen three floors. The smell on the
      wind is that of fresh leaves and trees in the courtyard. In contrast to
      the excitement of the last few seconds, the night is deathly silent.
      Unmoving, I feel only the throbbing pain in my throat. It tells me that
      I’m still alive. As for the corpse…well, whatever it is, it isn’t done
      yet. If I don’t want to die, then I know what I need to do. Kill. Before
      it kills me. With that thought, the cavernous emptiness that had until
      moments ago gripped my heart fades away. All my doubts, all my worries,
      disappear all at once. “That’s all?” I whisper. It’s only then that I
      awaken, for real this time. How stupid and foolish I was, to brood as I
      did, when all along the answer was so fine and simple. “Catty in more than
      one sense, aren’t we?” says a voice from behind Shiki, a voice she
      recognizes as the therapist’s. Shiki does not turn to meet her, still
      shocked from the fall. “You again? Kind of late for therapy, don’t you
      think?” Shiki asks. “I’ll have you know I was standing guard,” answered
      the self-styled mage nonchalantly. “It all had to come to a head tonight,
      before you got out, one way or the other. These ghosts wanted your body
      but couldn’t get it, so they possess a dead body to take care of that
      problem.” “Please don’t tell me this is all because of that weird stone
      you left in the room.” “Oh ho, so she remembers. No, it’s not the rune’s
      fault, but I will admit this is a mistake I did not foresee. I erected a
      ward that should have kept ghosts out, but then they get themselves a
      corporeal body to circumvent that. They usually aren’t that smart, neither
      with the body, or their dogged determination to have you specifically. I
      smell strings behind this.” The mage chuckles, as if this was all some
      grand game she was playing with another of her kind, and she had just made
      a small tactical mistake. “Well, now’s your chance to rectify that. Why
      not show me some of the magic up your sleeve, mage?” “Don’t mind if I do.”
      With that, the mage snaps a finger. In the air, her hand moves as if to
      conduct a mudra, manipulating the cigarette she holds to describe a symbol
      made out of straight lines in the air, which finds itself suddenly
      projected onto the still-staggered corpse. It is rune script, her conduit
      to arcane power, and through it she sets fire to the rotting body, putting
      flame to it from afar. “The Ansuz I have is too weak for this,” she
      grumbles, seemingly disappointed. The reason soon becomes clear. The
      flames embrace the corpse, but it only starts to stand up, unmindful of
      its current state. The bones on its leg are clearly broken, and yet once
      it stands it continues to advance, shuffling and dragging itself towards
      Shiki. It is not long before the flames extinguish themselves, the power
      animating it expiring. “Are you telling me he’s still standing? Are you a
      real mage or are we in the part where you try selling me bridges?” “I
      think I preferred you more docile. This is difficult, and definitely not
      my area of expertise. If it was a regular human, bam, end of story. But
      since it’s a corpse, it doesn’t really mind if it loses an arm or a head.
      You’d need an incinerator to stop him, or maybe a particularly devout monk
      could—” “Let’s make this quick, shall we? Long story short, you can’t do
      it.” The mage shoots Shiki an annoyed glance at what she just said, her
      pride forced to submit to her inability. “Don’t think your newfound
      talents are going to save you from that thing for long, too. It’s already
      dead. While you can kill people, you’re a long way away from unmaking the
      death-touched. We’ll fall back for now.” The mage retreats a step. Shiki,
      however, remains unmoving, though not through any injury from the fall.
      She is only smiling, as if this ridicule in itself was enough to stop the
      approaching enemy. “Dead or whatever you wanna call it, that body is
      moving, still ‘living’, right? Then—” Shiki finally lifts herself up,
      standing now with back bent in the manner of some ancient predator. She
      puts a finger to her neck, feels the texture of her torn skin, and of the
      life blood flowing out of it, the traces of strangulation still left. And
      yet, here I stand, alive. The sensation of it is almost orgasmic.
      “—whatever it is, I’ll kill it,” she finishes. The bandages that blinded
      Shiki come loose and drift away on the wind, at last revealing in the
      midst of the black night her spellbound Eyes. In an instant, she puts
      energy into her legs, breaking into a run, every kick of her legs
      scattering the soil beneath her feet. She sees everything now. She sees
      the corpse and how it raises a hand to strike her as she approaches. Shiki
      is only barely able to duck under it. Most especially now, she sees the
      lines, no longer as threatening as before, but inviting, throbbing and
      pulsating to an invisible rhythm. She sees the lines on the corpse, and
      with one hand traces one of their number, stretching from right shoulder
      to left hip. Though her hand seems to slip easily into the line, the
      attack costs her a broken finger, a minor inconvenience compared to the
      injury dealt to Shiki’s enemy, who is now cut in half. Like a puppet being
      cut from its strings, the thing collapses in a heap, its one arm the only
      part of it still able to move, grasping Shiki’s leg like a writhing
      insect. Without mercy, Shiki quickly stomps on it with her foot. “What a
      useless piece of death you are,” she spits out, more indignant than she
      has ever been. “Begone from my sight!” She laughs a silent laugh and
      thinks, I’m alive! All that worry and trouble, gone like bad lies, and the
      only truth is that I live. “Shiki!” calls out the mage from the distance.
      She throws a thin, silvery object at the ground near Shiki, and before it
      lands it catches a glint of the moonlight. A knife, plain and unadorned.
      She retrieves it from the ground and sets about its first task. She looks
      down at the persistent half-body clinging to her for a moment before
      bringing the knife down on its throat. The corpse stops moving almost
      instantly, but the mage calls out again. “You idiot! Stab it right in the
      heart!” But it is already too late. Faster than her rebuke comes the white
      haze that Shiki once knew, floating back into ethereal existence the
      moment Shiki brought down the knife. At once, it beats a hasty retreat…not
      away, but into Shiki’s body. She falls to her knees as if in a trance. In
      the moment that Shiki lost herself to the ecstasy of murder, it is then
      that they make their move to possess her, when the sense of self is
      weakened. The mage draws closer to Shiki. “She didn’t finish it, the
      damned fool.” It seems, however, that Shiki still maintains some tenuous
      control, as she holds out an outstretched arm towards the mage. Don’t come
      closer, it seems to say, and the mage finds herself complying. Now with
      both hands, Shiki grasps the knife, fingers clinging to it like the symbol
      of life itself, and positions it point-downwards above her own chest.
      Determination returns to her hollow eyes. Her lips are still as she grits
      her teeth and brings the knife slowly downwards until the tip touches
      lightly upon the skin of her breast. She tells herself in her mind that
      neither her body nor the hallow of her soul have not yet been plundered by
      any foolish ghost. “Now there’s nowhere for you to run,” she speaks to no
      one but herself. Shiki directs the spellbound sight of her Arcane Eyes
      inward to see the death of the spectral thing that plagued her, willing
      and weaving her magic to kill it and only it. Believing only that she
      won’t be injured from what she was about to do, she gathers her strength.
      “I’ll kill the weak part of me. And you will never have Shiki Ryōgi ever
      again.” She presses the knife downwards, the blade sliding smoothly
      through flesh. The few seconds that pass before she moves again carry the
      air of a ritual, and when she does move, she withdraws the knife from her
      chest. No blood runs from her breast, nor are there any traces of it on
      the blade. But she feels the phantom pain of that knife all the same. She
      takes a swing at the air, violently, as if to remove the invisible taint
      of the spirits on the blade, and then speaks to the mage. “I remember what
      you said. You said that you’d teach me how to use these Eyes.” Her voice,
      once so quivering and unsure, now settles into a confidence. The mage,
      seemingly satisfied, nods her assent. “Make no mistake, friend. This is a
      transaction. You’ll learn to focus your talent, but in return you’ll help
      me with my work. I recently lost my familiar, so I need another pair of
      helping hands.” “Right,” Shiki says without even turning to look at her
      benefactor. “Does that mean I get to kill people?” The question makes even
      the mage shiver in spite of herself, but she tries to remove her
      reservation in her answer. “Obviously.” “Then you have me. Do whatever you
      want with me. After all, it’s not as if I have any direction in my life.”
      And with that, she falls unconscious, tired from the fighting, and from
      the pain on her chest, a look of melancholy on her face just before she
      collapsed. The mage lifts her up in her arms, staring for a long time at
      Shiki’s sleeping face. In contrast to her countenance only moments ago,
      her face is now tranquil, enough to create the illusion that no life ever
      flowed through those cheeks. Before long, the mage offers her own words,
      not caring whether Shiki hears her or not. “No direction, huh?
      Unfortunately, you’re wrong again.” She begins to detest the peace on
      Shiki’s face. “Because a hollowed soul means you can put as much as you
      can back into it. Where else can you find better prospects, you lucky
      bastard?” She clicks her tongue in annoyance, for these are words that she
      thought she’d forgotten how to say. Slowly, slowly, I slip into dream. But
      even in dream the question remains: The man known as Shiki no longer
      exists, but what did he gain, and what did he hope to protect, by
      disappearing as he did? In dream, Ryōgi’s memories provide the answer like
      a parting gift. He died to protect a shared dream, a dream of finally
      finding his—our—own slice of peace. And he thought we had found it. He
      believed in him, in that boy. He died for me, and for that boy, and he
      left me with this deep, abiding, loneliness. Warm sunshine forces open my
      eyelids, and I remember now that my Eyes are no longer covered, no longer
      blind. It feels like I’m lying down on the bed. That mage must have put me
      back in my room when I fell unconscious last night, set things back to
      right. Completely still, I absorb as much of the morning atmosphere as I
      can manage, taking in the warm yet fleeting sunlight, as if to let it wash
      out the darkness that possessed me last night. I feel the languor of the
      morning, feel it melding the dreams of my twin existence to create one
      fleeting life. I want so much to cry for Shiki, but I’ve decided to cry
      only once from now on. He represents something I’ll never be able to
      return to, and this isn’t the time and place for tears, and so my eyes are
      dry. Besides, he would have wanted to disappear without anyone crying
      anyway. “Morning, Shiki.” I hear a voice coming from beside my bed, and
      when I turn my head to look toward it, there sits a familiar friend, his
      appearance unchanged even in the face of two years. The black, unadorned
      hair he keeps, and the similarly black-rimmed glasses: both are exactly as
      they were, as if he stepped out of past and into present. “Do you…still
      know who I am?” he asks with marked hesitation. He didn’t need to. Yeah, I
      know. You’re the one that waited, the only one that cared enough to watch
      over me. “Mikiya Kokutō, right?” I respond, almost in a whisper. “Last
      name still sounds like some French poet to my ears.” He smiles as broadly
      as the day we met the second time in school. I wonder, though, if he still
      remembers the promise we made. “Nice day out today. Perfect weather for
      getting out of the hospital, don’t you think?” Faintly, I can see the
      tears behind his eyes that he is so desperately trying to hold back and
      sound as natural as he can. It’s a touching sentiment. He chose to smile
      rather than to cry. Just like Shiki chose to recognize solitude instead of
      becoming solitary. Though I still don’t know which of the two I should
      side for. “Guess there are still things I didn’t lose,” I mutter as I look
      at him contentedly, the sunlight streaming in through the window behind
      him half-obscuring his smile. I know that such gestures aren’t enough to
      heal my empty heart, but still… It was still the same smile I remember,
      unchanged neither by time or flawed memory.
