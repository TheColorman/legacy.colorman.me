    <p>
      A Hallow - I “Hey, you’ve heard about the patient on the private room on
      the third floor, right?” “Oh, who hasn’t at this point? The word’s been
      passed on from mouth to mouth since yesterday, and even that poker faced
      neurosurgeon Dr. Ashika had to show at least some surprise at that girl’s
      sudden recovery. I couldn’t believe it myself.” “No, no, I mean the story
      after that. What do you think the patient did after she woke up from her
      coma? Promise me you won’t freak out or anything, okay, but she tried to
      crush her own eyes!” “Come on, that’s not true!” “It is! Dr. Ashika’s
      trying his best to keep it a secret, but I heard the story from one of his
      interns, so it has to be real. Apparently, she used her palm to put
      pressure on her eyes in like, the three seconds that Dr. Ashika wasn’t
      looking. What a horror show.” “But with that girl in a coma for two years,
      she really shouldn’t be able to move, right?” “Yeah, but we basically
      exercised her limbs everyday to prevent the disuse atrophy. Her family
      even paid the hospital a mountain of cash just to make sure we do it.
      Still, it obviously can’t completely stop it, and her body still has
      trouble moving. Probably why her attempt to destroy her eyes failed.”
      “Still, it’s a rarity for a person in bed rest for two years to even move,
      let alone poke out her own eyes.” “That’s why Dr. Ashika was surprised.
      Wait a minute; what do you call it when the blood vessels in the eye
      bleed?” “Subconjunctival hemorrhage, was it? Don’t tell me the girl got
      that too?” “You know it. It’s really supposed to heal by itself, but since
      the ocular trauma was so hard, she’s temporarily blind on top of that. The
      intern told me that the patient just wanted her eyes bandaged, so that’s
      what they did.” “What a shame. Even now that she’s awake she still can’t
      see anything. Makes my heart tighten a little.” “It does, doesn’t it? And
      there’s still the question of her aphasia. Seems she still can’t speak,
      the poor thing. And since Dr. Alaya left last month we haven’t had a
      therapist to handle her. But I hear Dr. Ashika’s calling in someone he
      knows. Until she’s regained some of her mental faculties we’re keeping her
      on a strict ‘no visitors’ policy. Even the parents are only getting a
      little time to spend with her.” “I see. That’s too bad for our little
      boy.” “What? Which little boy?” “Oh, you don’t know! There’s this little
      kid, right? Well, I guess we can’t really call him a kid anymore, with his
      age and all. He’s the one who brought that girl over here in the first
      place, and he still comes to visit every Saturday. I’m really rooting for
      him to meet her again.” “Oh, you mean that kid. The one everyone was
      giving nicknames to. I never realized he was still coming. Hard to find
      that level of sincerity these days, don’t you think?” “Yeah, he’s the only
      one that’s been coming to visit her these past two years. He even beat out
      her parents. Even I’m inclined to believe that part of that girl’s
      miraculous recovery is because of him.” “I never thought you were that
      sentimental.” “That’s alright. Neither did I.” Beyond and below lay only
      darkness. This void, lifeless place could only mean one thing: I was dead.
      Without anything to even clothe me, I, Shiki Ryōgi, floated, and then sank
      slowly into the fathomless, lightless sea. There was no end in sight.
      There was nothing in sight, neither light, and yes, perhaps even darkness.
      This place was only a hollow, where all meaning ceased to be. A stygian
      abyss that could not be put into words, and without words it shall remain:
      a cypher called, simply, “ ”. I fell deeper into the “ ”, and my naked
      body slowly acquired the pallor of the grave, and it made me want to look
      away. In my mind, I knew that everything in this place comes to be the
      same way. “Is this death?” I whispered, though it came out so faint, I
      doubted if it was even real. Though time too had no meaning inside “ ”, I
      observed it. Like a stream tracing out into the infinite, like the process
      of decay, I mark it. It was an eternity. I plunged ever deeper, and cast
      my eyes farther, and in that eternity, this place was still empty, devoid
      of anything except me. And yet, it was all so calm and serene. It feels as
      if, in this place without meaning, the fact that I existed at all fits me.
      Here lay entropy, the end of all things, a place the living may never
      observe, but only the dead may enter. I died. And yet I am still alive. I
      felt my mind about to lose its grip. Two years. An instant, stretched out
      to an eternity. Both are accurate measures of my time spent in this “ ”.
      Here, I touched death. Here, I fought for my life. Here, I awakened. The
      light breeze through the window and the sound of boisterous activity
      outside my room stirs my mind to wake. I can hear nurses and patients
      alike scurrying in the corridor outside. The sound of their footsteps and
      the soft whispers of their conversations build to a low background hum,
      always present at a hospital in the early morning hours. Compared to how
      silent last night was, this sounded like some sort of convention, and a
      noisy one, as far as I was concerned. I liked my waking hours silent.
      Thankfully, in the secluded space of my private room, I’m sheltered from
      the worst of the noise. It didn’t take long for a doctor to arrive and
      check up on me. “How are we feeling today, Miss Ryōgi?” Silence. It stumps
      him, and for a moment, we are both quiet. “I see. At least you’ve seemed
      to calm down since last night. Unfortunately, since we didn’t get the
      chance to do it last time, I’m going to have to explain your situation to
      you. Feel free to talk if you feel something’s not right.” I didn’t really
      have any interest in paying attention to him, but since it seems like he
      mistook my lack of a response for consent, it looks like I don’t really
      have a choice in the matter. “Then I’ll tell you straight out: today is
      the fourteenth of June 1998. Two years ago, on the fifth of March, you
      were involved in a traffic accident, hit by a car in a pedestrian crossing
      at night. Then you were brought here, to this hospital. Do you remember
      anything that I’m saying?” Silence from me again. The last thing I can
      remember is someone—a classmate, maybe?—standing stock still in the rain.
      As for the accident, nothing is coming to mind. “Oh, don’t worry if you
      can’t remember it. When the accident occurred, it’s likely you noticed the
      car and tried to jump out of the way. That’s why there isn’t any serious
      damage on your body. On the other hand, you did receive a strong hit on
      your head. You were already comatose when they brought you here, but it
      seems there’s no brain damage. But your mental faculties might still be
      recovering from your two year coma. I can’t say for sure if your memories
      will return, but it’s looking that way, since last night’s EEG detected no
      abnormalities in your brain activity. Anyway, the fact that you woke up
      from your coma is a miracle in itself. There’s very little possibility of
      that after two years, you see.” Even though he makes a point to emphasize
      the length of my coma, it still isn’t hitting home for me. For me,
      yesterday is still that rain-soaked night, followed by a vast hollow of
      emptiness. “And if you’re about to ask,” the doctor continues, “your eyes
      are mostly fine. It’s just a blunt injury, which rarely damages the eyes
      in a permanent way. We’re lucky there wasn’t anything sharp nearby last
      night. Another week or so, and we’ll be able to take off the bandages so
      you can finally enjoy the nice scenery.” I detect a tiny hint of rebuke in
      his words this time. I suppose he’s a bit frustrated with my little
      attempt to destroy my eyes. He was pretty persistent last night in asking
      me why I did it, but I couldn’t answer then as well. They’d think I was
      crazy. “You’re locked into physical therapy sessions, one in the morning,
      and another in the afternoon. As for visiting hours, I’m afraid we’re
      restricting it until your body and mind are back to normal: an hour a day.
      Bear with it for a while. Once you’re done, you’re out of here.” Well,
      that’s a mood ruiner if there ever was one. Not having the heart to voice
      my cynicism so early in the morning, I instead try to test my right hand’s
      responsiveness by moving it, and find that there is no change. Trying to
      kickstart it into action takes me a few seconds, and I can feel the joints
      and muscles straining as I make the most minute, yet painful movements. It
      almost feels like it isn’t my own hand. I suppose it’s what I should
      expect after two years of disuse. “Well, that’s it for this morning. Since
      you’ve seemed to calm down, I won’t have a nurse watch over you all day
      today. If you need anything at all—water, a book—just press the button
      next to your pillow. The nurse’s station is right down the hall,” the
      doctor says in the gentle, practiced words designed to put a patient at
      ease. Were I able to see, I’d probably see him with a similarly rehearsed
      smile, one he probably practiced in the bathroom mirror all night. I hear
      him start to open the door, but stops to say one last thing. “Oh, yes, I
      almost forgot. You’ll have another doctor starting tomorrow, for your
      speech condition. She’s a bit closer to your age, so try to be
      less…stoic…around her. From what I see, you’re going to need the
      expertise.” And so, after he left, I was alone again. I lie flat on the
      bed, arms over my eyes that I myself asked to be bandaged shut. “My name
      is—”, I whisper with dry lips still unused to speech, “Shiki Ryōgi.” The
      same as before? Maybe not. Maybe she was killed, in those two years of
      emptiness. All of the memories of someone named Ryōgi are all there in my
      head, all ready for me to draw out. But what of it? What use are they to
      me, who died once and awoke? I feel so…disconnected to my past self.
      There’s no mistaking I’m me, but the memories in my head don’t feel like
      they are. It’s like I’m watching a biopic. Main character: Ryōgi. Weird
      ghost image caught in some of the frames: me. I bite my lips until I’m
      sure I’m still awake. It’s all I have to make sure I’m still here. I’m a
      puzzle with a missing piece close to my chest, and the hole makes my
      insides feel as hollow as a cave with wind howling through it. I’m missing
      my reason for living. “And so? What the fuck does it matter?” I mutter to
      myself with as much conviction as I can muster. And once I’ve said that, I
      feel less troubled by it. Strangely, this feeling of disquiet and
      irritation that scratches and pulls at my chest is sort of refreshing, in
      its own way. There’s anxiety. There’s pain. But those are feelings that
      the sixteen-year old still held on to. Me? I’m unimpressed. I don’t know
      why I’m still alive but I have no intention of looking a gift horse in the
      mouth. Not like I feel alive in the first place anyway. I’m just here,
      now; nursing an existence of being adrift on the wind. Morning turns to
      night turns to morning again, and a new day comes, whether or not I can
      see the sunlight. I am strangely relieved that even without sight, I can
      feel the slow rise of morning. However, the reason for this relief remains
      a mystery, since the nurse that took my morning examination came and
      interrupted my thoughts. Before I knew it, she had finished, and left me
      alone again, but that wasn’t the end of my day. My mother and brother came
      to talk. They felt like strangers, and I couldn’t come to grips with the
      reality that they were my relatives. Left with no alternative, I managed
      to mumble little words to them, in the manner that my memories told me
      would. It made my mother happy at least, and my brother seemed pleased. It
      all had the air of some comical farce, and we all played our parts to the
      letter. Sometime past noon, I hear the door opening and a person step
      inside my room. As soon as I hear the clicking heels, I immediately know
      that it isn’t anyone familiar. I remember that I was going to get a new
      doctor starting today, but before I could ask, the newcomer starts to
      speak. “Hel—lo! Doing fine today?” says the newcomer, drawing out her
      hello in an attempt at familiarity. A woman, judging from her voice.
      “Well, I must say, I expected someone that looked more ghastly, but look
      at you! Your skin is quite pretty. You’re just the kind of girl I can talk
      to, I think. Now aren’t I lucky?” Her voice is young, maybe somewhere in
      her 20’s, and has the kind of lilting, up-and-down quality of someone who
      is too cheerful for her own good. I hear her make her way to the chair
      beside my bed and sit herself down. “Pleased to make your acquaintance,”
      she continues. “I’m not a doctor from here so I don’t come with an ID.
      Still, with your eyes covered and all, I don’t think it’ll be much of a
      problem. I’m a speech therapist. You know, for your aphasia and—”
      “Aphasia? Who, me? I’m sorry; you must have me confused with someone
      else.” And so I finally speak. She seems like a person worth messing with,
      so I cut her off mid sentence. It doesn’t seem to faze her however, since
      she responds with an “Mmhmm”, with what must have been an accompanying nod
      of the head. “Now, normally I’d be angry, but since I already know that
      your aphasia is a misdiagnosis, I’ll let it slide. That Ashika is such a
      by-the-books doctor; he can’t handle special cases like yours. But hey,
      it’s not like you can’t share the blame for that. Obviously you’re going
      to raise some suspicion if you keep your mouth shut like you’ve been
      doing.” She makes a friendly, amused chuckle. For some reason, I’m
      imagining her wearing glasses. She just seems like the type. “So they
      think I have aphasia?” “Yep. After all, you did hurt your brain some in
      the accident, so they must have thought that the part of your brain that
      puts words in your mouth was damaged. But it’s not that isn’t it? You’re
      just a stubborn young girl with some issues. That having been said, it’s
      beginning to look like I’m not needed, but I don’t want to get fired a
      minute into the job. And since my other job isn’t exactly overflowing with
      customers, I think I’ll keep you company.” Well, a minute into her job and
      she’s already proved herself to be an annoyance I can hardly stomach. I
      reach a hand out for the button to call a nurse, but the doctor is faster.
      I feel her hand reach it first and she deftly maneuvers the wire from my
      reach. “What the hell, lady?” I utter in indignation. “Whew, that was
      close. If you tell Ashika now, the gig is up. Come on, let’s cut a deal
      here. You pretend to have aphasia and I won’t ask you any stupid
      questions, they won’t call in a new doctor, and I get to earn some money
      on the side. That way we both benefit. How about it?” Well, I have to
      admit, that sounds like a nice proposition, but definitely illegal on some
      level. Still, I have to wonder what kind of person this woman is when she
      can just belt out something like that without hesitation. I turn my
      bandaged eyes to where her voice is coming from, hoping I am looking
      straight at her. “You’re not a real doctor, are you?” I ask. “Right on the
      first try. I make a living as a…magician, of sorts.” Oh, brother. This
      just took a turn for the crazy. “Don’t have a need for a con artist.” She
      replies with a chuckle. “I suppose not. A magician can’t fill the hollow
      in your soul, after all. Only a regular person can do that.” “W—wait a
      minute, what did you just say?” “Oh, you must have noticed it. See, you’re
      all alone now.” The lilt in her voice that I first perceived as cheerful
      now grants a menacing air to her speech. I hear her stifle the urge for
      one last chuckle, and then standing up and walking across the room towards
      the door. “Doesn’t look like you’re in the mood to talk today, so let’s
      leave it at that for now. We’ll try again tomorrow. By—e.” By the time she
      said goodbye, the cheerfulness had returned to her voice. The sound of the
      door opening and closing signal her sudden departure, as abruptly as she’d
      arrived. With difficulty, I put my right hand on my lips. I was speechless
      at what she’d said. All alone. A hollow in the soul. It is those words
      that make me remember. Oh no. Oh, dear God no. How could I forget him? I
      can’t find him. In my mind, I call out, over and over, and he, the other
      me, doesn’t answer. Shiki Ryōgi is gone. He’s gone. was once one of those
      people who suffered another personality, sleeping and residing within her.
      The reason for it was simple. It was a trait, passed down through
      generations in the bloodline of the Ryōgi. The legends tell vaguely of
      some long past flirtation with the occult and arcane, but I don’t know if
      that can be believed. This trait, which in a normal family would have been
      cursed, was instead celebrated and honed, an indication of a state of
      grace. Those born with it are treated as the heirs to the dynasty. And so
      it was with , who was made the heir even over her older brother. She was
      an aberrant case. The alternate personality will always be a different
      gender than the actual person. Among the male Yang and the female Yin, the
      male personality usually emerges as the dominant. In those who carried the
      trait, all have been born male, but carried a female personality within
      them. was the first female born. Inside her was another, the man named
      Shiki. For the most part, the one that controlled the body was still —me,
      in other words. Shiki represented all of my more base aspects and all of
      the thoughts I struggled to repress. lived only by continually stifling
      and killing the darkness within herself called Shiki, over and over, until
      it was the only way she knew how to act normally. Not that Shiki had a
      problem with that. He seemed quite content to lie dormant the majority of
      the time, while I call him out in times where I needed his particular
      brand of aggressiveness, such as in sword sparring. Always, he would come
      to surface, glad to have the chance to be out, but at the same time bored
      and resigned to his role. At first it might seem like a relationship
      between a master and a servant, but the truth was much more complicated.
      In the end, and Shiki were one person. Whatever did, Shiki also desired,
      and when Shiki’s desires were suppressed, it was done entirely through his
      own volition. Which was fortunate, since Shiki had what might be called…
      homicidal tendencies. Now, as far as I knew, he didn’t actually commit any
      murder…maybe. But what’s true is that he continually dreamed of the act of
      murdering his fellow man. expressly forbade it, and tried her best to
      ignore it. But even as they ignored each other, they would never be
      separated. Isolated as was from the normalcy of the outside world, she was
      never lonely, thanks to Shiki. But the time finally came when the cracks
      in that connection began to show. It was two years ago, ’ first year of
      high school. Shiki had never shown any desire to use the body, but it was
      the first time he had wanted to surface and take control. From then
      onwards, suffered from gaps in her memory, spaces where she couldn’t
      remember what happened and what she was doing. As for me, the memories
      from my freshman year up until the accident are gone. I can only recall
      fragments, lost without context: me standing in the scene of a homicide,
      throat dry, staring at the dark red blood. One other series of images
      stands out: The memory of a classroom bathed in sunset, giving it the same
      vivid red hue that dominates both recollections, the classmate who
      destroyed , the one Shiki wanted to kill, and the one last piece of an
      ideal, normal life that Shiki wanted so much to protect. And since waking
      up from the coma, the name of that classmate has remained out of reach, no
      matter how hard I try. The hospital has its own rhythm, its own sort of
      respiration. The raucous noise of the morning eventually dims slowly into
      the almost absolute silence of the night. Occasionally, the sound of
      slippers echoing in the corridor breaks the placidity, and is my only
      reminder that I am still awake. The black shroud that blinds me now serves
      only to highlight how alone I am, an entirely foreign sensation that never
      had. She was never alone. But now Shiki is gone, and his loss is keenly
      felt. In fact, the only way I know I am me and not him right now is
      because I can’t feel his presence. “Probably the worst way to know your
      identity: identifying yourself because of what you lost, because of what
      you aren’t. “ I take a shot at some good, old-fashioned self-loathing, but
      it isn’t helping. I wish I was just a little sad. That at least would be a
      change from the hollow soul that the “doctor” said I had. Like the husk of
      some old ship, its worth nothing without anything inside it. If so, what
      goes inside? I’d…go inside. A whispering, coming from somewhere in the
      room. I can feel air rush in from the corridor outside, can hear the
      almost inaudible creak of the door opening. I try to tell myself I’m
      imagining it, but I turn to the direction of the sound all the same. A
      flickering, almost numinous white haze. I shouldn’t be able to see it, but
      it makes a mockery of that statement. Amidst the complete darkness, it’s
      the only thing I can see. It stands, vaguely like a human, but without
      bones to hold it up, in a state of being somewhere in between liquid and
      gas. It travels towards me, flowing and spreading at the same time in a
      disgusting motion. I am helpless, unable to move my body, so I can do
      nothing but wait for it. At least it has a form I can comprehend. Things
      without form are the truly frightening things. At least, with a shape,
      your mind can understand it. I don’t sense any hostile intent from this
      spirit, if that is even what it is. It’s even strangely comforting. For
      how different are we really, this thing that doesn’t live, and me who has
      no reason to live? The spirit caresses me in the cheek, at which point my
      entire body freezes, the sensation feeling like someone pouring ice water
      on my spine. It hurts, but I can’t move. I can’t even scream. I can only
      witness it. We stay that way, unmoving, from midnight until the sun starts
      to come up. At the crack of early morning, I feel it melting away, like a
      desiccated slug. As soon as I feel the icy grip loosening, I fall into
      deep sleep. Several days have passed since I first woke from the coma, but
      the doctors have seen fit to keep my eyes bandaged for now. In a marked
      shift from the noise which I had come to think was standard hospital
      policy, this particular morning is so peaceful I lose myself taking in the
      little motions of the day. I can hear the birds chirping outside my
      window, feel the daylight shining through it, and I allow my lungs to be
      filled with the crisp air. Yes, compared to the world I was in for two
      years, this world is truly a sight to behold. But with each morning that I
      wake up to the sprawling life of the world, I think: this world is only as
      happy as people are alone. The safest way to live is to be alone, but why
      can’t people think that that’s enough? Once, I had a perfect setup. I
      didn’t need anyone else. But the circumstances have conspired to make me
      wait for the part that I seem to lack, and if current trends are any
      indication, I might have to wait forever. But what, or who, exactly am I
      waiting for? My conversations with the “speech therapist-slash-magician”,
      such as she was, became a daily affair. In a hospital life full of
      batteries of tests and therapy sessions, it’s become something to look
      forward to; a welcome respite from the day-to-day banality. Now, as
      always, our conversation takes a turn back to my past, and as always, she
      is positioned in the chair by my bed, talking in her own carefree manner.
      “Mmm, now I see. So it’s not that Shiki couldn’t control the body, just
      that he showed no desire to do it. You—well, both of you—are proving to be
      quite the amusing couple.” She had come suspiciously armed with some very
      extensive knowledge of my background, some of which I know for a fact only
      a few people know. She knew the curse behind the Ryōgi dynasty, the most
      tightly kept secret of the family. She knew of my limited involvement in
      the serial killing that wracked the city two years ago; details which I
      would normally be much more secretive about, but I’ve long since resigned
      myself to the outcome and consequences, though the crime and perpetrator
      remain ambiguous, even inside my head. I find not having to think about it
      has made for a less stressful thinking environment. “There’s nothing
      amusing about having a dual personality,” I impulsively interject. She
      clicks her teeth in disappointment. “A cute label, but not accurate, I’d
      say. Both of you exist simultaneously, each of you having your own will: a
      recipe for dissociation. And yet, you both perform the same actions. It’s
      complicated, and the label ‘dual personality’ doesn’t do it justice.
      Something like ‘composite independent personality’ seems more fitting.”
      “Hey, tack on a ‘republic’ in the end there and it’ll sound like some new
      Balkan country.” “Ah, well, I never said I was good with names. Still, I
      do find it weird that, according to you, Shiki always slept, even though
      he didn’t need to.” A matter only I could probably answer. It had always
      been that way. Shiki had always liked to dream, to be off in some astral
      adventure somewhere in his own imagining, an act that had never shown any
      interest in. “So, is he still sleeping now?” she prods playfully, but I
      find that I can’t answer her. “Then he really is dead, isn’t he? He took
      your place as the consciousness that died during the accident, and the
      memories that he took in became lost to oblivion. Explains the gaps in
      your memories, at least. And without those memories, the knowledge of how
      involved you were to the serial killing two years ago might be lost
      forever.” “So I’m assuming the suspect is still at large?” “Indeed, but
      you know how this city plays. We say ‘oh, dear’ at a serial murder we see
      on TV, and then go back to eating our dinner. To most of the city in the
      last two years, it’s become some sort of bad joke. The rest have just
      forgotten.” She laughs, leaving in doubt how much of her statement she
      actually believed. “Shiki still puzzles me, though. If he hadn’t done
      anything, it would have been the consciousness that died. What reason
      would he have for taking your place like he did?” “To be honest, it’s
      still something I’m thinking about,” I say with hesitation. “But enough
      about him. Did you bring the scissors I asked for?” “Sorry, but Ashika and
      the rest of his minions didn’t allow it. You have, um…well, a history with
      your eyes, so they’re not allowing anything sharp.” Well, I can’t say I
      didn’t expect anything less. I’ve been doing pretty well with my physical
      therapy, and I’ve even been able to move my body. They said it’s the first
      time they saw someone recover so fast with just two PT sessions every day.
      As a sort of celebration, I asked for a pair of scissors from the good
      doctor. “What were you going to use the scissors for anyway? Flower
      arrangement on your bedside table?” “Hell no. I just wanted to cut my
      hair, that’s all.” The hair problem has been bothering me ever since I
      woke up from my coma. It’s become quite long in the span of two years.
      Every time I move my head it keeps tickling my neck and back, and is
      probably the strongest proof I have of how infuriatingly burdening long
      hair is. “You should have just said so, then! It’s easy enough for me to
      call in a hairdresser if you don’t want to talk.” “Thanks, but no thanks.
      Can’t stand ‘em. I will not be held responsible for what I do when someone
      other than me does things to my hair.” “Oh, I totally know what you mean.
      We women do have to take care of our hair. You know, I really am jealous
      of you that your hair growing longer seems to be the only indication that
      you’ve aged.” I hear the sound of her standing up. “So! Since I couldn’t
      bring you scissors, let me just leave you with another thing. It’s not
      much, but I’m sure it’ll be fine. It’s a stone with some rune inscriptions
      on it. Think of it as a protective charm. I’ll put it over the door, so
      it’s important that you not let anyone take it off.” Now I hear the sound
      of her dragging the chair to the door, after which she must be using it to
      put the rune in place. Then, she opens the door. “Well, guess that’s it
      for now. Someone else might be coming tomorrow, so do be a good girl until
      then.” She departs then, leaving me only with those strange words and the
      rune. Night has fallen, and midnight has past, but my usual visitor hasn’t
      revealed himself yet. Each midnight, without fail, the hazy spirit comes.
      Tonight proves to be the exception. Each night, as with the first, it had
      always given me a loving caress, always on the cheek. It was painful, and
      perhaps even dangerous, but I couldn’t care less even if he did choose to
      eventually kill me. It’d probably be a much simpler affair. In the dark, I
      brush the bandages wrapped around my eyes lightly with a finger. It won’t
      be long now until my eyesight recovers. There remains one thing to do
      before that happens, however: to destroy my eyes; this time, with no room
      for error. Without sight, I cannot see them, but it’s only a matter of
      time before they are revealed again. If having sight means to keep seeing
      those…things that must not be seen, then the choice is obvious. It’s much,
      much more preferable to never see the world than to ever see those things
      again. Still, maybe there is some other way. It’s the last resort until I
      can find some other means to live. Man, I am pathetic. The of the past
      would have destroyed her eyes without a single word or thought to the
      contrary. I, on the other hand, am hesitating. Not enough will to live,
      but not enough to die either. If that spirit ever gets it in its head to
      kill me for some reason, I probably won’t cheer it on, but I probably
      won’t raise a hand in defiance either.
