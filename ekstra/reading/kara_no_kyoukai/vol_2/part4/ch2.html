    <p>
      For most everyone else in the world during the laid back days of early
      June of 1998, it was as calm and easy a summer as any other. For Tōko
      Aozaki, it was the season she would first come to know the intriguing
      personality known as Shiki Ryōgi. It all began when Tōko had just taken in
      a new hire, impressed by the boy’s ability to track her down despite her
      preventative efforts. As fate would have it, this new hire apparently had
      a yarn to spin about his friend, the previously mentioned Shiki, and as a
      way to pass the time on a particularly lazy afternoon, Tōko decided to
      listen to him. Apparently this Shiki was in a coma, brought on after a car
      accident. She was in a persistent vegetative state, where the chances of
      waking up are below zero with the decimal numbers going into extreme
      lengths. It seems that he also heard, from the nurses’ gossip at least,
      that Shiki hadn’t aged a day since her coma, a little detail that Tōko had
      been immediately suspicious of. “Really now? Even the dead haven’t seen
      the end of entropy yet.” she had said, trying to hide the curiosity in her
      voice. “Sounds a bit like…magic, doesn’t it?” “I don’t expect you to
      believe it, ma’am, but it’s true. There’s not a spot of the last two years
      on her. Still, enough about my personal hang-ups. I don’t suppose you have
      any curious coma stories to match mine, do you ma’am?” He hadn’t expected
      Tōko to take him seriously, but nevertheless, she folded her arms and
      tried to dig up a story. “Let’s see now—there was this story from some far
      off country where a woman got married then promptly fell into a coma when
      she was twenty years old. God knows what the reason was, though. Rude of
      her, huh? Anyway, her particular case lasted for fifty years. Heard of
      it?” “Can’t say I have,” said the boy, shaking his head. “So what happened
      to her after she woke up?” “A surprisingly healthy mental state. Almost
      like she never even went into a coma! Can you imagine? She started
      recalling past memories, names; the whole deal. Sad that it didn’t do
      anything to make the husband happy, though.” “What? Why would the husband
      be sad after her wife recovered?” “Well, it’s more the wife’s problem,
      really. Her mind was as fresh as it was before the coma, but her body’s
      taken the atrophy train to seventy year old land. She wanted to run, go
      exercise, do athletics, but she obviously couldn’t, and she couldn’t
      really understand why. The fact that she’d aged fifty years just didn’t
      register as the truth in her mind. The husband on the other hand, felt so
      bad for the wife that he actually said, with tears coming out of his eyes,
      that it might have been better for everyone if she hadn’t woken up.” She
      said all this as she relaxed in her chair, swinging it from side to side
      lazily. “How about it, huh? Now that’s a story I don’t expect you to
      believe. Hope it helped contextualize this entire thing for you.” After
      Tōko told this story, the boy fell silent, prompting her to speak and prod
      him into conversation again. “Oh, but has a bad premonition suddenly crept
      into the little man’s head?” Tōko asks with a playful grin from cheek to
      cheek decorating her face. The boy nods in assent. “It’s a thought I’ve
      never wanted to entertain, actually: the thought that Shiki might not
      actually want to come back.” “Ah, but what’s this?” Tōko suddenly said,
      putting a hand on her temple and pretending to be a psychic. “I sense a
      reason behind this. We’ve got a lot of time to kill, so please, do tell.”
      The boy seemed angered at this approach, and turns away. “I’d really
      rather not, ma’am. You know, it wouldn’t hurt to be a bit more sensitive
      to people.” “Hey, you’re the one that started talking about her in the
      first place, friend. Don’t start telling stories if you don’t like where
      they’re leading. I’m only asking to pass the time, and because every time
      Azaka calls me, she always keeps yapping on about this ‘Shiki’ person. I
      mean, how on Earth can we women gossip when I don’t even know the first
      thing about the person?” As soon as Azaka’s name is mentioned, the boy
      frowns in dismay. “I’d been meaning to ask at some point, ma’am, but where
      and how exactly did you and my sister meet?” “Long story short, we met
      when I was on a trip to investigate a little case I was working on. We
      met, and due to circumstances beyond my control, she ended up finding out
      about me being a mage.” “Well, whatever. I would ask that you please
      refrain from pulling her in too much into your world, though,” he said,
      the suspicion clear in his voice. “She’s at a very delicate and
      impressionable age.” Tōko couldn’t help but chuckle at that. “You don’t
      know the half of it. I won’t butt into your family problems, you have my
      word. And in exchange for that, let’s go back to our previous topic and
      get me interested in this Shiki person.” She lights a cigarette and leaned
      forward on her desk, the head cradled in her hands positively beaming.
      Seeing there was no talking Tōko out of it, the boy could only sigh as he
      started to tell the story that began two years ago, on the snowy night
      when he and first met. In high school as classmates, had showed no
      interest in making nice with the rest of the student body, but it was the
      boy who struck up a friendship with her. But in the second half of
      freshman year, around the time the serial killer started making him or
      herself known, became more aloof and withdrawn, a matter eventually
      explained when she eventually revealed to him that she suffered a split
      personality, one of which had a taste for murder. If and how she was
      connected to the serial killings was never found out. In a rain-soaked
      night colder than any that had come before, encountered an accident before
      the boy’s very eyes. The boy and the girl were whisked away to a hospital,
      where she still resides in a coma. At first, Tōko listened to this story
      as one would listen to any half-truth told over a beer, but as it
      progressed, the smile was slowly wiped from her face. At last, the boy
      finished relating the story, wearing a solemn expression of that told of
      how delicate a subject this must have been for him. “So, I guess that’s
      the long and the short of that particular two-year old story,” he
      concludes. “Well, she isn’t some vampire in torpor, I can tell you that.
      Still, now I might have some idea…” Tōko’s words descended into the
      particular brand of murmuring she has when she’s pondering the solution to
      a hard problem. The smile that had disappeared from her face now returns,
      though this time as a sly curl of the lips. “Remind me again what
      character you use for her name.” “It’s ‘’ as in ‘sūshiki’, or ‘formula’.
      Why? Is there anything special about it?” “Or, alternatively, the ‘’ as in
      ‘shikigami’, that unique Japanese style of goetic theurgy. And on top of
      that, she’s a member of the Ryōgi dynasty. I’m beginning to see what this
      is all about, and it stinks of magic.” Unable to contain herself, Tōko
      extinguished her cigarette on the ashtray and stands up. “The hospital was
      in the suburbs, wasn’t it? I’ll be back in a few. I just need to go see
      about this sleeping beauty of ours.” And without waiting for a reply from
      the boy, Tōko left her office, along with the boy, unable to think of
      anything except how exactly she had found herself in such a favorable
      position. She felt like she could almost feel the subtle rifts and changes
      in the skeins of fate, shifting to bring her here, at this singular point.
